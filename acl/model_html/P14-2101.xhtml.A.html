<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Latent topics derived by topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are the result of hidden thematic structures which provide further insights into the data..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The automatic labelling of such topics derived from social media poses however new challenges since topics may characterise novel events happening in the real world..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which depend on external knowledge sources become less applicable here since relevant articles/concepts of the extracted topics may not exist in external sources..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a summarisation problem..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We introduce a framework which apply summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> These algorithms are independent of external sources and only rely on the identification of dominant terms in documents related to the latent topic..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We compare the efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation algorithms..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Our results suggest that summarisation algorithms generate better topic labels which capture event-related context compared to the top- n terms returned by LDA..</a>
