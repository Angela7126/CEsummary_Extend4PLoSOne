<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> It aims at leveraging word boundary information, automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments, to induce a preferable segmentation model..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose dealing with the induced word boundaries as soft constraints to bias the continuous learning of a supervised CRFs model, trained by the treebank data (labeled), on the bilingual data (unlabeled..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph propagation constraint..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The constrained model induction is accomplished by using posterior regularization algorithm..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The experiments on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task reveal that the proposed model can bring positive segmentation effects to translation quality..</a>
