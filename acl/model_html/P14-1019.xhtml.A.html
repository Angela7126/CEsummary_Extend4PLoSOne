<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Much of the recent work on dependency parsing has been focused on solving inherent combinatorial problems associated with rich scoring functions..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In contrast, we demonstrate that highly expressive scoring functions can be used with substantially simpler inference procedures..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Specifically, we introduce a sampling-based parser that can easily handle arbitrary global features..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Inspired by SampleRank, we learn to take guided stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We introduce two samplers for traversing the space of trees, Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings with Random Walk..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The model outperforms state-of-the-art results when evaluated on 14 languages of non-projective CoNLL datasets..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Our sampling-based approach naturally extends to joint prediction scenarios, such as joint parsing and POS correction..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> The resulting method outperforms the best reported results on the CATiB dataset, approaching performance of parsing with gold tags..</a>
