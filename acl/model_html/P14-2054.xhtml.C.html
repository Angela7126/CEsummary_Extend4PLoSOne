<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose two polynomial time inference algorithms to compress sentences under bigram and dependency-factored objectives.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first algorithm is exact and requires O ( n 6 ) running time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It extends Eisner s cubic time parsing algorithm by using virtual dependency arcs to link deleted words.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Two signatures are added to each span, indicating the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The second algorithm is a fast approximation of the first one.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It relaxes the compression ratio constraint using Lagrangian relaxation, and thereby requires O ( n 4 ) running time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Experimental results on the popular sentence compression corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we proposed two polynomial time decoding algorithms using joint inference for sentence compression.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The first one is an exact dynamic programming algorithm, and requires O ( n 6 ) running time.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This one does not show significant advantage in speed over ILP.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The second one is an approximation of the first algorithm.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It adopts Lagrangian relaxation to eliminate the compression ratio constraint, yielding lower time complexity T O ( n 4.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In practice it achieves nearly the same accuracy as the exact one, but is much faster.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>3 3 Our code is available at http://code.google.com/p/sent-compress/.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The main assumption of our method is that the dependency parse tree is projective, which is not true for some other languages.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In that case, our method is invalid, but [ 17 ] still works.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In the future, we will study the non-projective cases based on the recent parsing techniques for 1-endpoint-crossing trees [ 14 ].</a>
