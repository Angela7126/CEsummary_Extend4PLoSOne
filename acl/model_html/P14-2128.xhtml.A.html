<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Modern statistical dependency parsers assign lexical heads to punctuations as well as words..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Punctuation parsing errors lead to low parsing accuracy on words..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this work, we propose an alternative approach to addressing punctuation in dependency parsing..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Rather than assigning lexical heads to punctuations, we treat punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words, used as features to guide the parser to build the dependency graph..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Integrating our method with an arc-standard parser yields a 93.06 % unlabelled attachment score, which is the best accuracy by a single-model transition-based parser reported so far..</a>
