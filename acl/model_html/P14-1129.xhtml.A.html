<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recent work has shown success in using neural network language models (NNLMs) as features in MT systems..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Here, we present a novel formulation for a neural network joint model (NNJM), which augments the NNLM with a source context window..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our model is purely lexicalized and can be integrated into any MT decoder..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We also present several variations of the NNJM which provide significant additive improvements..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Although the model is quite simple, it yields strong empirical results..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> On the NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English condition, the NNJM features produce a gain of +3.0 BLEU on top of a powerful, feature-rich baseline which already includes a target-only NNLM..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The NNJM features also produce a gain of +6.3 BLEU on top of a simpler baseline equivalent to Chiang s [ 5 ] original Hiero implementation..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Additionally, we describe two novel techniques for overcoming the historically high cost of using NNLM-style models in MT decoding..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> These techniques speed up NNJM computation by a factor of 10,000x, making the model as fast as a standard back-off LM..</a>
