<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Semantic hierarchy construction aims to build structures of concepts linked by hypernym hyponym ( is-a ) relations..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This paper proposes a novel and effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on word embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between words..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve F-score to 80.29%..</a>
