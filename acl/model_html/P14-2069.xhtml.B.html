<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we have presented a novel emotion-aware LDA model that is able to quickly build a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for languages without many manually constructed resources..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The proposed EaLDA model extends the standard LDA model by accepting a set of domain-independent emotion words as prior knowledge, and guiding to group semantically related words into the same emotion category..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Thus, it makes the emotion lexicon containing much richer and adaptive domain-specific emotion words..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Experimental results showed that the emotional lexicons generated by our algorithm is of high quality, and can assist emotion classification task..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> For future works, we hope to extend the proposed EaLDA model by exploiting discourse structure knowledge, which has been shown significant in identifying the polarity of content-aware words..</a>
