<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Denoising autoencoders provide an intuitive solution for domain adaptation transform the features into a representation that is resistant to the noise that may characterize the domain adaptation process..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The original implementation of this idea produced this noise directly [ 12 ] ; later work showed that dropout noise could be analytically marginalized [ 4 ]..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We take another step towards simplicity by showing that structured dropout can make marginalization even easier, obtaining dramatic speedups without sacrificing accuracy..</a>
