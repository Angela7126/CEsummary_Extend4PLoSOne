<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Most existing relation extraction models make predictions for each entity pair locally and individually, while ignoring implicit global clues available in the knowledge base, sometimes leading to conflicts among local predictions from different entity pairs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a joint inference framework that utilizes these global clues to resolve disagreements among local predictions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We exploit two kinds of clues to generate constraints which can capture the implicit type and cardinality requirements of a relation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Experimental results on three datasets, in both English and Chinese, show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art relation extraction models when such clues are applicable to the datasets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And, we find that the clues learnt automatically from existing knowledge bases perform comparably to those refined by human.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we make use of the global clues derived from KB to help resolve the disagreements among local relation predictions, thus reduce the incorrect predictions and improve the performance of relation extraction.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Two kinds of clues, including implicit argument type information and argument cardinality information of relations are investigated.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models if we can find such clues in the KB.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Furthermore, our framework is scalable for other local sentence level extractors in addition to the MaxEnt model.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Finally, we show that the clues can be learnt automatically from the KB, and lead to comparable performance to manually refined ones.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For future work, we will investigate other kinds of clues and attempt a joint optimization framework that could host entity disambiguation, relation extraction and entity linking together.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We will also adopt selection preference between entities and relations since sometimes we may not find useful clues.</a>
