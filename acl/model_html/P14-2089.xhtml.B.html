<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have presented a new learning objective for neural language models that incorporates prior knowledge contained in resources to improve learned word embeddings..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We demonstrated that the Relation Constrained Model can lead to better semantic embeddings by incorporating resources like PPDB, leading to better language modeling, semantic similarity metrics, and predicting human semantic judgements..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our implementation is based on the word2vec package and we made it available for general use 2 2 https://github.com/Gorov/JointRCM..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We believe that our techniques have implications beyond those considered in this work..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We plan to explore the embeddings suitability for other semantics tasks, including the use of resources with both typed and scored relations..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Additionally, we see opportunities for jointly learning embeddings across many tasks with many resources, and plan to extend our model accordingly..</a>
