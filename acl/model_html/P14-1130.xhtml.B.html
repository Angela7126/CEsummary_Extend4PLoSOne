<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Accurate scoring of syntactic structures such as head-modifier arcs in dependency parsing typically requires rich, high-dimensional feature representations..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We introduce a low-rank factorization method that enables to map high dimensional feature vectors into low dimensional representations..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our method maintains the parameters as a low-rank tensor to obtain low dimensional representations of words in their syntactic roles, and to leverage modularity in the tensor for easy training with online algorithms..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We implement the approach on first-order to third-order dependency parsing..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our parser outperforms the Turbo and MST parsers across 14 languages..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Future work involves extending the tensor component to capture higher-order structures..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In particular, we would consider second-order structures such as grandparent-head-modifier by increasing the dimensionality of the tensor..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> This tensor will accordingly be a four or five-way array..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The online update algorithm remains applicable since each dimension is optimized in an alternating fashion..</a>
