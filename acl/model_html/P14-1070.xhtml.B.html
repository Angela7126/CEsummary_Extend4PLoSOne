<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Treebank [ 1 ] , as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task [ 23 ]..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our work focused on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged..</a>
