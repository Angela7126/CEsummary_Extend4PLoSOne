<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Segmentation of clitics has been shown to improve accuracy on a variety of Arabic NLP tasks..</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Experiments show that our system outperforms existing systems on newswire, broadcast news and Egyptian dialect, improving segmentation F 1 score on a recently released Egyptian Arabic corpus to 95.1%, compared to 90.8% for another segmenter designed specifically for Egyptian Arabic..</a>
