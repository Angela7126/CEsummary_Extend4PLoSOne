<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present experiments in using discourse structure for improving machine translation evaluation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Then, we show that these measures can help improve a number of existing machine translation evaluation metrics both at the segment- and at the system-level..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Rather than proposing a single new metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to the state-of-the-art evaluation metrics, and thus should be taken into account in the development of future richer evaluation metrics..</a>
