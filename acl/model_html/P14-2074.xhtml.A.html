<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The evaluation of computer-generated text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions has typically been measured using unigram bleu and human judgements..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed bleu , ter , rouge-su4 , and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The main finding is that unigram bleu has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements..</a>
