<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We considered the problem of unsupervised solution post identification from discussion forum threads..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Towards identifying solutions to the problem posed in the initial post, we proposed the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature for the solution identification problem; that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We model and harness lexical correlations using translation models, in the company of unigram language models that are used to characterize reply posts, and formulate a clustering-based EM approach for solution identification..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We show that our technique is able to effectively identify solutions using just one non-content based feature, the post position, whereas previous techniques in literature have depended heavily on structural features (that are not always available in many forums) and supervised information..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our technique is seen to outperform the sole unsupervised solution identification technique in literature, by a large margin; further, our method is even seen to be competitive to recent methods that use supervision, beating one of them comfortably, and trailing another by a narrow margin..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In short, our empirical analysis illustrates the superior performance and establishes our method as the method of choice for unsupervised solution identification..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Exploration into the usage of translation models to aid other operations in discussion forums such as proactive word suggestions for solution authoring would be interesting direction for follow-up work..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Discovery of problem-solution pairs in cases where the problem post is not known beforehand, would be a challenging problem to address..</a>
