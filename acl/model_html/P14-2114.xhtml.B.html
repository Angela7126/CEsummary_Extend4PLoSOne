<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our proposed model has been evaluated on the FSD corpus..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experimental results show our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7% in F-measure..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In future work, we plan to investigate inferring geolocations automatically from tweets..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We also intend to study a better method to infer date more accurately from tweets and explore efficient ranking strategies to rank evens extracted for a better presentation of results..</a>
