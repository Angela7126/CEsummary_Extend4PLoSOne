<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we combine existing NLP techniques with minimal supervision to build memory tips according to the keyword method, a well established mnemonic device for second language learning.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present what we believe to be the first extrinsic evaluation of a creative sentence generator on a vocabulary learning task.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results demonstrate that NLP techniques can effectively support the development of resources for second language learning.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we have presented a semi-automatic system for the automation of the keyword method and used it to teach 40 Italian words to 20 English native speakers.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We let the system select appropriate keywords and generate sentences automatically.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For each Italian word, we selected the most suitable among the 10 highest ranked suggestions and used it for the evaluation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The significant reduction in retention error rate (between 17% and 45% on different word groups) for the words learned with the aid of the automatically generated sentences shows that they are a viable low-effort alternative to human-constructed examples for vocabulary teaching.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As future work, it would be interesting to involve learners in an interactive evaluation to understand the extent to which learners can benefit from ad-hoc personalization.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Furthermore, it should be possible to use frameworks similar to the one that we presented to automate other teaching devices based on sentences conforming to specific requirements [] , such as verbal chaining and acrostic.</a>
