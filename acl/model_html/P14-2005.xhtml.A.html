<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This paper extends the original BLANC ( BLANC-gold henceforth) to system mentions, removing the gold mention assumption..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The proposed BLANC falls back seamlessly to the original one if system mentions are identical to gold mentions, and it is shown to strongly correlate with existing metrics on the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL data..</a>
