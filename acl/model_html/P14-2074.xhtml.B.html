<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we performed a sentence-level correlation analysis of automatic evaluation measures against expert human judgements for the automatic image description task..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We found that sentence-level unigram bleu is only weakly correlated with human judgements, even though it has extensively reported in the literature for this task..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Meteor was found to have the highest correlation with human judgements, but it requires Wordnet and paraphrase resources that are not available for all languages..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our findings held when judgements were made on human-written or computer-generated descriptions..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The variability in what and how people describe images will cause problems for all of the measures compared in this paper..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Nevertheless, we propose that unigram bleu should no longer be used as an objective function for automatic image description because it has a weak correlation with human accuracy judgements..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We recommend adopting either Meteor, Smoothed bleu , or rouge-su4 because they show stronger correlations with human judgements..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We believe these suggestions are also applicable to the ranking tasks proposed in Hodosh et al..</a>
