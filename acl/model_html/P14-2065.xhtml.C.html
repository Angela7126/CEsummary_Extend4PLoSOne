<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Any given verb can appear in some syntactic frames ( Sally broke the vase , The vase broke ) but not others (* Sally broke at the vase , * Sally broke the vase to John.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is now considerable evidence that the syntactic behaviors of some verbs can be predicted by their meanings, and many current theories posit that this is true for most if not all verbs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If true, this fact would have striking implications for theories and models of language acquisition, as well as numerous applications in natural language processing.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, empirical investigations to date have focused on a small number of verbs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We report on early results from VerbCorner, a crowd-sourced project extending this work to a large, representative sample of English verbs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Results of Phase 1 provide support for the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis, at least as a strong bias.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>More work will be needed to determine the strength of that bias.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The findings are largely consistent with VerbNet s semantics, but changes are indicated in some cases.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We find that inter-annotator agreement is sufficiently high that annotation can be done effectively using the modal response with an average of 6-7 responses per item.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We are currently investigating whether we can achieve better reliability with fewer responses per item by taking into account an individual annotator s history across items, as recent work suggests is possible [ 13 , 17 , 19 ].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus, crowd-sourcing VerbNet semantic entailments appears to be both feasible and productive.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Data-collection continues.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Phase 2, which added over 10 new verb classes, is complete.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Phase 3, which includes both new classes and new entailments, has been launched.</a>
