<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we investigate various strategies to predict both syntactic dependency parsing and contiguous multiword expression (MWE) recognition, testing them on the dependency version of French Treebank [ 1 ] , as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task [ 23 ].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our work focuses on using an alternative representation of syntactically regular MWEs, which captures their syntactic internal structure.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We obtain a system with comparable performance to that of previous works on this dataset, but which predicts both syntactic dependencies and the internal structure of MWEs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This can be useful for capturing the various degrees of semantic compositionality of MWEs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We experimented strategies to predict both MWE analysis and dependency structure, and tested them on the dependency version of French Treebank [ 1 ] , as instantiated in the SPMRL Shared Task [ 23 ].</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The main weakness of our system comes from the identification of regular MWEs, a property which is highly lexical.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our current use of external lexicons does not seem to suffice, and the use of data-driven external information to better cope with this identification can be envisaged.</a>
