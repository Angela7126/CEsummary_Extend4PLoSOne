<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have explored deeper integration of morphological desegmentation into the statistical machine translation pipeline..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We have presented a novel, finite-state-inspired approach to lattice desegmentation, which allows the system to account for a desegmented view of many possible translations, without any modification to the decoder or any restrictions on phrase extraction..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> When applied to English-to-Arabic translation, lattice desegmentation results in a 1.0 BLEU point improvement over one-best desegmentation, and a 1.7 BLEU point improvement over unsegmented translation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We have also applied our approach to English-to-Finnish translation, and although segmentation in general does not currently help, we are able to show significant improvements over a 1-best desegmentation baseline..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In the future, we plan to explore introducing multiple segmentation options into the lattice, and the application of our method to a full morphological analysis (as opposed to segmentation) of the target language..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Eventually, we would like to replace the functionality of factored translation models [ 18 ] with lattice transformation and augmentation..</a>
