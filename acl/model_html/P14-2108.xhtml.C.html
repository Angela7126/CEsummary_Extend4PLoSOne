<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper presents the first results on parsing the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE), a million-word historical treebank with an annotation style similar to that of the Penn Treebank (PTB.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We describe key features of the PPCMBE annotation style that differ from the PTB, and present some experiments with tree transformations to better compare the results to the PTB.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First steps in parser analysis focus on problematic structures created by the parser.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We have presented the first results on parsing the PPCMBE and discussed some significant annotation style differences from the PTB.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adjusting for two major differences that are a matter of annotation convention, we showed that the PPCMBE can be parsed at approximately the same level of accuracy as the PTB.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The first steps in an investigation of the parser differences show that the parser is generating structures that violate basic well-formedness conditions of the annotation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For future work, we will carry out a more serious analysis of the parser output, trying to more properly account for the differences in bracketing structure between the PPCMBE and PTB.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>There is also a great deal of data annotated in the style of the PPCMBE, as indicated in footnotes 1 and 1 , and we are interested in how the parser performs on these, especially comparing the results on the modern English corpora to the older historical ones, which will have greater issues of orthographic and tokenization complications.</a>
