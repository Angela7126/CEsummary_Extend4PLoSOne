<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing at entire tree level, referred to as ambiguity-aware ensemble training..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Instead of only using 1-best parse trees in previous work, our core idea is to utilize parse forest ( ambiguous labelings ) to combine multiple 1-best parse trees generated from diverse parsers on unlabeled data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> With a conditional random field based probabilistic dependency parser, our training objective is to maximize mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This framework offers two promising advantages..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> 1) ambiguity encoded in parse forests compromises noise in 1-best parse trees..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> During training, the parser is aware of these ambiguous structures, and has the flexibility to distribute probability mass to its preferred parse trees as long as the likelihood improves..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> 2) diverse syntactic structures produced by different parsers can be naturally compiled into forest, offering complementary strength to our single-view parser..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Experimental results on benchmark data show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline supervised parser and other entire-tree based semi-supervised methods, such as self-training, co-training and tri-training..</a>
