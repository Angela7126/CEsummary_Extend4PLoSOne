<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity translation pair discovery.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our proposed hybrid approach of using both explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn improves entity translation by 0.02.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This paper studied temporality features for relation equivalence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>With the proposed features, we devised a hybrid approach combining corpus latent and explicit features with complementary strength.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We empirically showed the effectiveness of our hybrid approach on relation translation, and it, in turn, improved entity translation.</a>
