<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we introduced the stochastic iterative correction method for spell check corrections..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method improved the performance of popular spelling correction approach   the noisy channel model   in the correction of difficult spelling errors..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We showed how to eliminate the local minima issue of simulated annealing and proposed a technique to make our algorithm deterministic..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The experiments conducted on the specialized datasets have shown that our method significantly improves the performance of the correction of hard spelling errors (by 6.6% F 1 ) while maintaining good performance on common spelling errors..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In continuation of the work we are considering to expand the method to correct errors in multi-word queries, extend the method to work with discriminative models, and use a query performance prediction method, which tells for a query whether our algorithm needs to be applied..</a>
