<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The automatic estimation of machine translation (MT) output quality is a hard task in which the selection of the appropriate algorithm and the most predictive features over reasonably sized training sets plays a crucial role..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> When moving from controlled lab evaluations to real-life scenarios the task becomes even harder..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Indeed, the instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different distributions calls for adaptive solutions that react to new operating conditions..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Contrastive experiments in different testing conditions involving user and domain changes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach..</a>
