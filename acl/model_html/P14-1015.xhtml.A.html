<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Discussion forums have evolved into a dependable source of knowledge to solve common problems..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, only a minority of the posts in discussion forums are solution posts..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Identifying solution posts from discussion forums, hence, is an important research problem..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper, we present a technique for unsupervised solution post identification leveraging a so far unexplored textual feature, that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We use translation models and language models to exploit lexical correlations and solution post character respectively..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our technique is designed to not rely much on structural features such as post metadata since such features are often not uniformly available across forums..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Our clustering-based iterative solution identification approach based on the EM-formulation performs favorably in an empirical evaluation, beating the only unsupervised solution identification technique from literature by a very large margin..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We also show that our unsupervised technique is competitive against methods that require supervision, outperforming one such technique comfortably..</a>
