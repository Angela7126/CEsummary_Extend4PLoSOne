<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The effort required for a human annotator to detect sentiment is not uniform for all texts, irrespective of his/her expertise.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We aim to predict a score that quantifies this effort, using linguistic properties of the text.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our proposed metric is called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As for training data, since any direct judgment of complexity by a human annotator is fraught with subjectivity, we rely on cognitive evidence from eye-tracking.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The sentences in our dataset are labeled with SAC scores derived from eye-fixation duration.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using linguistic features and annotated SACs, we train a regressor that predicts the SAC with a best mean error rate of 22.02% for five-fold cross-validation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We also study the correlation between a human annotator s perception of complexity and a machine s confidence in polarity determination.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The merit of our work lies in (a) deciding the sentiment annotation cost in, for example, a crowdsourcing setting, (b) choosing the right classifier for sentiment prediction.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As a future work, we would like to investigate how SAC of a test sentence can be used to choose a classifier from an ensemble, and to determine the pre-processing steps (entity-relationship extraction, for example.</a>
