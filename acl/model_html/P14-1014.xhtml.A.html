<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper 1 1 This work was done while the first author was visiting SUTD we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.27 % average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers..</a>
