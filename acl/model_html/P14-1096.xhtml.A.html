<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to identify noun sense changes based on rigorous analysis of time-varying text data available in the form of millions of digitized books..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Our approach can be applied for lexicography, as well as for applications like word sense disambiguation or semantic search..</a>
