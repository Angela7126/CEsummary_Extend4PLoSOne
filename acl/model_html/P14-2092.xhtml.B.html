<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have presented a simple but effective approach to integrating the sentence skeleton information into a phrase-based system..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In our future work we plan to investigate methods of integrating both syntactic models (for skeleton translation) and phrasal models (for full translation) in our system..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We also plan to study sophisticated reordering models for skeleton translation, rather than reusing the baseline reordering model which is learned on the full sentences..</a>
