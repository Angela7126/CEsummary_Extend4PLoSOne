<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Language acquisition is a complex task, in which many heterogeneous sources of information may be useful..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this paper, we investigated whether contextual semantic information could be of help when learning phonetic categories..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We found that this contextual information can improve phonetic learning performance considerably, especially in situations where there is a high degree of phonetic ambiguity in the word-forms that learners hear..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This suggests that previous models that have ignored semantic information may have underestimated the information that is available to infants..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our model illustrates one way in which language learners might harness the rich information that is present in the world without first needing to acquire a full inventory of word meanings..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The contextual semantic information that the TLD model tracks is similar to that potentially used in other linguistic learning tasks..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Theories of cross-situational word learning ( 40 ; 53 ) assume that sensitivity to situational co-occurrences between words and non-linguistic contexts is a precursor to learning the meanings of individual words..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Under this view, contextual semantics is available to infants well before they have acquired large numbers of semantic minimal pairs..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> However, recent experimental evidence indicates that learners do not always retain detailed information about the referents that are present in a scene when they hear a word ( 27 ; 49..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> This evidence poses a direct challenge to theories of cross-situational word learning..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Our account does not necessarily require learners to track co-occurrences between words and individual objects, but instead focuses on more abstract information about salient events and topics in the environment; it will be important to investigate to what extent infants encode this information and use it in phonetic learning..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Regardless of the specific way in which infants encode semantic information, our method of adding this information by using LDA topics from transcript data was shown to be effective..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> This method is practical because it can approximate semantic information without relying on extensive manual annotation..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> The LD model extended the phonetic categorization task by adding word contexts; the TLD model presented here goes even further, adding larger situational contexts..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Both forms of top-down information help the low-level task of classifying acoustic signals into phonetic categories, furthering a holistic view of language learning with interaction across multiple levels..</a>
