<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A common task in qualitative data analysis is to characterize the usage of a linguistic entity by issuing queries over syntactic relations between words..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Previous interfaces for searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> User interface research suggests that it is easier to recognize a pattern than to compose it from scratch; therefore, interfaces for non-experts should show previews of syntactic relations..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> What these previews should look like is an open question that we explored with a 400-participant Mechanical Turk experiment..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than a baseline of naming the relations alone..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> This suggests that user interfaces should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose between different relations..</a>
