<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In order to extract new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content, this paper proposes a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven, and almost knowledge-free (except POS tags) framework..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We design statistical measures to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word, respectively..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and does not rely on elaborated linguistic rules..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We conduct extensive experiments to reveal the influence of different statistical measures in new word finding..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Comparative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms baselines remarkably..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Experiments also demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment words benefits sentiment classification definitely..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> From linguistic perspectives, our framework is capable to extract adjective new words because the lexical patterns usually modify adjective words..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> As future work, we are considering how to extract other types of new sentiment words, such as nounal new words that can express sentiment..</a>
