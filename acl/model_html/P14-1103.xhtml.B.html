<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A central assumption of Optimality Theory has been the existence of a fixed inventory of universal markedness constraints innately available to the learner, an assumption by arguments regarding the computational complexity of constraint identification..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, our results show for the first time that nonparametric, data-driven learning can identify sparse constraint inventories that both accurately predict the data and are phonologically meaningful, providing a serious alternative to the strong nativist view of the OT constraint inventory..</a>
