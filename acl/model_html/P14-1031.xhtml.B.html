<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for learning sentence-level sentiment..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our approach incorporates intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints while training a conditional random field model via posterior regularization..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We explore a rich set of context-aware constraints at both intra- and inter-sentential levels, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the analysis of sentence-level sentiment..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> While we focus on the sentence-level task, our approach can be easily extended to handle sentiment analysis at finer levels of granularity..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our experiments show that our model achieves better accuracy than existing supervised and semi-supervised models for the sentence-level sentiment classification task..</a>
