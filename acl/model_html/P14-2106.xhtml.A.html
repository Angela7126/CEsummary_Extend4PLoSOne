<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We study the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Overall, we can say that the improvements are small and not significant using automatic POS tags, contrary to previously published results using gold POS tags []..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition, we explore parser combinations, showing that the semantically enhanced parsers yield a small significant gain only on the more semantically oriented LTH treebank conversion..</a>
