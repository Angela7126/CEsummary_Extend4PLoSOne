<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper demonstrates that morphology and distributional features can be combined in a flexible, joint probabilistic model, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> A key advantage of this framework is the ability to include arbitrary features in the prior distribution..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Future work may exploit this advantage more thoroughly for example, by using features that incorporate prior knowledge of the language s morphological structure..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Another important goal is the evaluation of this method on languages beyond English..</a>
