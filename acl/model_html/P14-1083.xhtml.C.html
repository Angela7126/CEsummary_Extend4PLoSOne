<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT) that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an extrinsic response to a translation input.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We show how to generate responses by grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query against a database.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Experiments on the Geoquery database show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over learning from references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a translated query.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured learning for SMT.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We presented a proposal for a new learning and evaluation framework for SMT.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The central idea is to ground meaning transfer in successful interaction in an extrinsic task, and use task-based feedback for structured learning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We presented a proof-of-concept experiment that defines the extrinsic task as executing semantic parses of translated queries against the Geoquery database.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our experiments show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over structured learning from reference translations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our error analysis shows that response-based learning generates grammatical translations which is due to the additional use of a cost function that boosts similarity of translations to human reference translations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In future work, we would like to extend our work on embedding SMT in virtual gameplay to larger and more diverse datasets, and involve human feedback in the response-based learning loop.</a>
