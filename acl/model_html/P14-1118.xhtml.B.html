<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We carried out a systematic study on OM from YouTube comments by training a set of supervised multi-class classifiers distinguishing between video and product related opinions..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We use standard feature vectors augmented by shallow syntactic trees enriched with additional conceptual information..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This paper makes several contributions i) it shows that effective OM can be carried out with supervised models trained on high quality annotations; (ii) it introduces a novel annotated corpus of YouTube comments, which we make available for the research community; (iii) it defines novel structural models and kernels, which can improve on feature vectors, e.g.,, up to 30% of relative improvement in type classification, when little data is available, and demonstrates that the structural model scales well to other domains..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In the future, we plan to work on a joint model to classify all the comments of a given video, s.t it is possible to exploit latent dependencies between entities and the sentiments of the comment thread..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Additionally, we plan to experiment with hierarchical multi-label classifiers for the full task (in place of a flat multi-class learner..</a>
