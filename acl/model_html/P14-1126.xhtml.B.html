<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose an unsupervised projective dependency parsing approach for resource-poor languages, using existing resources from a resource-rich source language..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> By presenting a model training framework, our approach can utilize parallel text to estimate transferring distribution with the help of a well-developed resource-rich language dependency parser, and use unlabeled data as entropy regularization..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The experimental results on three data sets across ten target languages show that our approach achieves significant improvement over previous studies..</a>
