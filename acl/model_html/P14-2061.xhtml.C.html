<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we focus on the visual modality and present a method for identifying sign languages solely from short video samples.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The method is trained on unlabelled video data (unsupervised feature learning) and using these features, it is trained to discriminate between six sign languages (supervised learning.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We ran experiments on short video samples involving 30 signers (about 6 hours in total.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Using leave-one-signer-out cross-validation, our evaluation shows an average best accuracy of 84 %.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given that sign languages are under-resourced, unsupervised feature learning techniques are the right tools and our results indicate that this is realistic for sign language identification.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Future work can extend this work in two directions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>1) by increasing the number of sign languages and signers to check the stability of the learned feature activations and to relate these to iconicity and signer differences 2) by comparing our method with deep learning techniques.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In our experiments, we used a single hidden layer of features, but it is worth researching into deeper layers to improve performance and gain more insight into the hierarchical composition of features.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Other questions for future work.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>How good are human beings at identifying sign languages.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Can a machine be used to evaluate the quality of sign language interpreters by comparing them to a native language model.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The latter question is particularly important given what happened at the Nelson Mandela s memorial service 3 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-DxGoIVUWo.</a>
