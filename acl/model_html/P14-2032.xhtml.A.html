<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There are two dominant approaches to Chinese word segmentation word-based and character-based models, each with respective strengths..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Prior work has shown that gains in segmentation performance can be achieved from combining these two types of models; however, past efforts have not provided a practical technique to allow mainstream adoption..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose a method that effectively combines the strength of both segmentation schemes using an efficient dual-decomposition algorithm for joint inference..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our method is simple and easy to implement..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiments on SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 evaluation datasets show that our method achieves the best reported results to date on 6 out of 7 datasets..</a>
