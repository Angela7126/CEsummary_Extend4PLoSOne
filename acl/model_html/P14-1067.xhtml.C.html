<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The automatic estimation of machine translation (MT) output quality is a hard task in which the selection of the appropriate algorithm and the most predictive features over reasonably sized training sets plays a crucial role.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When moving from controlled lab evaluations to real-life scenarios the task becomes even harder.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Indeed, the instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different distributions calls for adaptive solutions that react to new operating conditions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Contrastive experiments in different testing conditions involving user and domain changes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the CAT scenario, each translation job can be seen as a complex situation where the user (his personal style and background), the source document (the language and the domain) and the underlying technology (the translation memory and the MT engine that generate translation suggestions) contribute to make the task unique.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So far, the adaptability to such specificities (a major challenge for CAT technology) has been mainly supported by the evolution of translation memories, which incrementally store translated segments incorporating the user style.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The wide adoption of translation memories demonstrates the importance of capitalizing on such information to increase translators productivity.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While this lesson recently motivated research on adaptive MT decoders that learn from user corrections, nothing has been done to develop adaptive QE components.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the first attempt to address this problem, we proposed the application of the online learning protocol to leverage users feedback and to tailor QE predictions to their quality standards.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Besides highlighting the limitations of current batch methods to adapt to user and domain changes, we performed an application-oriented analysis of different online algorithms focusing on specific aspects relevant to the CAT scenario.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Our results show that the wealth of dynamic knowledge brought by user corrections can be exploited to refine in a stepwise fashion the quality judgements in different testing conditions (user changes as well as simultaneous user and domain changes.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As an additional contribution, to spark further research on this facet of the QE problem, our adaptive QE infrastructure (integrating all the components and the algorithms described in this paper) has been released as open source.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Its C++ implementation is available at http://hlt.fbk.eu/technologies/aqet.</a>
