<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification using distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context; this technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word embeddings.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style frame-semantic analysis.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Additionally, we report strong results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling in comparison to prior work.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have presented a simple model that outperforms the prior state of the art on FrameNet-style frame-semantic parsing, and performs at par with one of the previous-best single-parser systems on PropBankSRL.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Unlike Das et al.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>2014 ) , our model does not rely on heuristics to construct a similarity graph and leverage WordNet; hence, in principle it is generalizable to varying domains, and to other languages.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally, we presented results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling with a system that included the task of automatic verb frame identification, in tune with the FrameNet literature; we believe that such a system produces more interpretable output, both from the perspective of human understanding as well as downstream applications, than pipelines that are oblivious to the verb frame, only focusing on argument analysis.</a>
