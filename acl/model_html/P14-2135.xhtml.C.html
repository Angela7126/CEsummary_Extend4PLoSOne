<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Models that learn semantic representations from both linguistic and perceptual input outperform text-only models in many contexts and better reflect human concept acquisition.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, experiments suggest that while the inclusion of perceptual input improves representations of certain concepts, it degrades the representations of others.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose an unsupervised method to determine whether to include perceptual input for a concept, and show that it significantly improves the ability of multi-modal models to learn and represent word meanings.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The method relies solely on image data, and can be applied to a variety of other NLP tasks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We presented a novel method, image dispersion-based filtering, that improves multi-modal representations by approximating conceptual concreteness from images and filtering model input.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The results clearly show that including more perceptual input in multi-modal models is not always better.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Motivated by this fact, our approach provides an intuitive and straightforward metric to determine whether or not to include such information.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition to improving multi-modal representations, we have shown the applicability of the image dispersion metric to several other tasks.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To our knowledge, our algorithm constitutes the first unsupervised method for quantifying conceptual concreteness as applied to NLP, although it does, of course, rely on the Google Images retrieval algorithm.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Moreover, we presented a method to classify adjective-noun pairs according to modification type that exploits the link between image dispersion and concreteness.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It is striking that this apparently linguistic problem can be addressed solely using the raw data encoded in images.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In future work, we will investigate the precise quantity of perceptual information to be included for best performance, as well as the optimal filtering threshold.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In addition, we will explore whether the application of image data, and the interaction between images and language, can yield improvements on other tasks in semantic processing and representation.</a>
