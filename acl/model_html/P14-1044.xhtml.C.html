<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Lexical resource alignment has been an active field of research over the last decade.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, prior methods for aligning lexical resources have been either specific to a particular pair of resources, or heavily dependent on the availability of hand-crafted alignment data for the pair of resources to be aligned.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Here we present a unified approach that can be applied to an arbitrary pair of lexical resources, including machine-readable dictionaries with no network structure.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our approach leverages a similarity measure that enables the structural comparison of senses across lexical resources, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the task of aligning WordNet to three different collaborative resources.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This paper presents a unified approach for aligning lexical resources.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our method leverages a novel similarity measure which enables a direct structural comparison of concepts across different lexical resources.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thanks to an effective ontologization method, our alignment approach can be applied to any pair of lexical resources independently of whether they provide a full-fledged network structure.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on aligning WordNet to three collaboratively-constructed resources with different characteristics, i.e.,, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and OmegaWiki.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We also show that our approach is robust across its different configurations, even when the training data is absent, enabling it to be used effectively for aligning new pairs of lexical resources for which no resource-specific training data is available.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In future work, we plan to extend our concept similarity measure across different natural languages.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We release all our data at http://lcl.uniroma1.it/semalign.</a>
