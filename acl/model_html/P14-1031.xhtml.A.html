<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the level of individual sentences..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Most existing machine learning approaches suffer from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across sentences and often fail to capture non-local contextual cues that are important for sentiment interpretation..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Experiments on standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings..</a>
