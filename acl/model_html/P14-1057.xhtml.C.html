<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An important search task in the biomedical domain is to find medical records of patients who are qualified for a clinical trial.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One commonly used approach is to apply NLP tools to map terms from queries and documents to concepts and then compute the relevance scores based on the concept-based representation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, the mapping results are not perfect, and none of previous work studied how to deal with them in the retrieval process.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we focus on addressing the limitations caused by the imperfect mapping results and study how to further improve the retrieval performance of the concept-based ranking methods.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In particular, we apply axiomatic approaches and propose two weighting regularization methods that adjust the weighting based on the relations among the concepts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Experimental results show that the proposed methods are effective to improve the retrieval performance, and their performances are comparable to other top-performing systems in the TREC Medical Records Track.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with ambiguity terminology in medical domain.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, the results of the NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often not perfect.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this paper, we present a general methodology that can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based on the relations among concepts.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>There are many interesting directions for our future work.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>First, we plan to study how to automatically predict whether to use concept-based indexing based on the quality of MetaMap results, and explore whether the proposed methods are applicable for other entity linking methods.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Second, we will study how to leverage other information from knowledge bases to further improve the performance.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Third, more experiments could be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods when using other ranking strategies.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Finally, it would be interesting to study how to follow the proposed methodology to study other domain-specific IR problems.</a>
