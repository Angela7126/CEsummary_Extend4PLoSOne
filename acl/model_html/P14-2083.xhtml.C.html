<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In linguistic annotation projects, we typically develop annotation guidelines to minimize disagreement.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, in this position paper we question whether we should actually limit the disagreements between annotators, rather than embracing them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We present an empirical analysis of part-of-speech annotated data sets that suggests that disagreements are systematic across domains and to a certain extend also across languages.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This points to an underlying ambiguity rather than random errors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, a quantitative analysis of tag confusions reveals that the majority of disagreements are due to linguistically debatable cases rather than annotation errors.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Specifically, we show that even in the absence of annotation guidelines only 2% of annotator choices are linguistically unmotivated.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper, we show that disagreements between professional or lay annotators are systematic and consistent across domains and some of them are systematic also across languages.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, we present an empirical analysis of POS annotations showing that the vast majority of inter-annotator disagreements are competing, but valid, linguistic interpretations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We propose to embrace such disagreements rather than using annotation guidelines to optimize inter-annotator agreement, which would bias our models in favor of some linguistic theory.</a>
