<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have proposed an algorithm for using a two-step collaboration between non-professional translators and post-editors to obtain professional-quality translations..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our method, based on a co-ranking model, selects the best crowdsourced translation from a set of candidates, and is capable of selecting translations which near professional quality..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Crowdsourcing can play a pivotal role in future efforts to create parallel translation datasets..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition to its benefits of cost and scalability, crowdsourcing provides access to languages that currently fall outside the scope of statistical machine translation research..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In future work on crowdsourced translation, further benefits in quality improvement and cost reduction could stem from 1) building ground truth data sets based on high-quality Turkers translations and 2) identifying when sufficient data has been collected for a given input, to avoid soliciting unnecessary redundant translations..</a>
