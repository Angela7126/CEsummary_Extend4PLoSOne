<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we propose a new method of cross-lingual model transfer, report initial evaluation results and highlight directions for its further development..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We observe that the performance of this method is competitive with that of established cross-lingual transfer approaches and its application requires very little manual adjustment no heuristics or filtering and no explicit shared feature representation design..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> It also retains compatibility with any refinement procedures similar to projected transfer [] that may have been designed to work in conjunction with direct model transfer..</a>
