<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper proposes a novel context-aware method for analyzing sentiment at the level of individual sentences.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Most existing machine learning approaches suffer from limitations in the modeling of complex linguistic structures across sentences and often fail to capture non-local contextual cues that are important for sentiment interpretation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In contrast, our approach allows structured modeling of sentiment while taking into account both local and global contextual information.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, we encode intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints and integrate them into the learning of conditional random field models via posterior regularization.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The context-aware constraints provide additional power to the CRF model and can guide semi-supervised learning when labeled data is limited.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Experiments on standard product review datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both the supervised and semi-supervised settings.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper, we propose a context-aware approach for learning sentence-level sentiment.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our approach incorporates intuitive lexical and discourse knowledge as expressive constraints while training a conditional random field model via posterior regularization.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We explore a rich set of context-aware constraints at both intra- and inter-sentential levels, and demonstrate their effectiveness in the analysis of sentence-level sentiment.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While we focus on the sentence-level task, our approach can be easily extended to handle sentiment analysis at finer levels of granularity.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our experiments show that our model achieves better accuracy than existing supervised and semi-supervised models for the sentence-level sentiment classification task.</a>
