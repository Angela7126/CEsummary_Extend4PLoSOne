<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, most such approaches are designed for bag-of-words models, and ignore the structured features present in many problems in NLP..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose a new technique called marginalized structured dropout , which exploits feature structure to obtain a remarkably simple and efficient feature projection..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Applied to the task of fine-grained part-of-speech tagging on a dataset of historical Portuguese, marginalized structured dropout yields state-of-the-art accuracy while increasing speed by more than an order-of-magnitude over previous work..</a>
