<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we explicitly consider sentence skeleton information for Machine Translation (MT.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic idea is that we translate the key elements of the input sentence using a skeleton translation model, and then cover the remain segments using a full translation model.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We apply our approach to a state-of-the-art phrase-based system and demonstrate very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST Chinese-English MT evaluation data.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have presented a simple but effective approach to integrating the sentence skeleton information into a phrase-based system.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves very promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In our future work we plan to investigate methods of integrating both syntactic models (for skeleton translation) and phrasal models (for full translation) in our system.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We also plan to study sophisticated reordering models for skeleton translation, rather than reusing the baseline reordering model which is learned on the full sentences.</a>
