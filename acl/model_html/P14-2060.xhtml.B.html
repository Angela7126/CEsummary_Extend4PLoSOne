<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we have presented methods for high precision abbreviation expansion for a TTS application..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The methods are largely self-organizing, using in-domain unannotated data, and depend on only a small amount of annotated data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Since the SVM features relate to general properties of abbreviations, expansions and contexts, the classifier parameters will likely carry over to new (English) domains..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We demonstrate that in combination with a hand-built TTS baseline, the methods afford dramatic improvement in the TP rate (to about 74% from a starting point of about 40%) and a reduction of FP to below our goal of 2%..</a>
