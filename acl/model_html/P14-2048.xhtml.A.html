<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We show that it is possible to automatically detect machine translated text at sentence level from monolingual corpora, using text classification methods..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We show further that the accuracy with which a learned classifier can detect text as machine translated is strongly correlated with the translation quality of the machine translation system that generated it..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Finally, we offer a generic machine translation quality estimation technique based on this approach, which does not require reference sentences..</a>
