<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a novel learning approach for statistical machine translation (SMT) that allows to extract supervision signals for structured learning from an extrinsic response to a translation input..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We show how to generate responses by grounding SMT in the task of executing a semantic parse of a translated query against a database..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Experiments on the Geoquery database show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over learning from references only on returning the correct answer from a semantic parse of a translated query..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In general, our approach alleviates the dependency on human reference translations and solves the reachability problem in structured learning for SMT..</a>
