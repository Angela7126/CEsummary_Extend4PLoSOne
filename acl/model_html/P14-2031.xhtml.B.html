<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The novelty of this paper is a computational analysis of the relationship between the edit history and the discussion of a Wikipedia article..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> As far as we are aware, this is the first study to automatically analyze this relationship involving the textual content of edits and turns..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Based on the types of turn and edit in an edit-turn-pair, we have operationalized the notion of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The basic assumption is that in a corresponding pair, the turn contains an explicit performative and the edit corresponds to this performative..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We have presented a machine learning system to automatically detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> To test this system, we manually annotated a corpus of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Trained and tested on this data, our system shows a significant improvement over the baseline..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> With regard to future work, an extension of the manually annotated corpus is the most important issue..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Our classifier can be used to bootstrap the annotation of additional edit-turn-pairs..</a>
