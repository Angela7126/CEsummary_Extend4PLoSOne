<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user information needs..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We propose a ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Our phrasal query abstraction framework generates a grammatical abstract from a conversation following three steps, as shown in Figure 1..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In this phase, our goal is to generate understandable informative abstract sentences that capture the content of the source sentences and represents the information needs defined by queries..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> There are several ways of generating abstract sentences (e.g., [ 2 , 18 , 8 , 23 ] ); however, most of them rely heavily on the sentence structure..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> We believe that such approaches are suboptimal, especially in dealing with conversational data, because multiparty written conversations are often poorly structured..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Instead, we apply an approach that does not rely on syntax, nor on a standard NLG architecture..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Moreover, since dealing with user queries efficiency is an important aspect, we aim for an approach that is also motivated by the speed with which the abstracts are obtained..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> We perform the task of abstract generation in three steps, as follows..</a>
