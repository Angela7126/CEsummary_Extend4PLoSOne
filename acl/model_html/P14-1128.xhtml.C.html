<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This study investigates on building a better Chinese word segmentation model for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It aims at leveraging word boundary information, automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments, to induce a preferable segmentation model.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose dealing with the induced word boundaries as soft constraints to bias the continuous learning of a supervised CRFs model, trained by the treebank data (labeled), on the bilingual data (unlabeled.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph propagation constraint.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The constrained model induction is accomplished by using posterior regularization algorithm.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The experiments on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task reveal that the proposed model can bring positive segmentation effects to translation quality.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This paper proposed a novel CWS model for the SMT task.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This model aims to maintain the linguistic segmentation supervisions from treebank data and simultaneously integrate useful bilingual segmentations induced from the bitexts.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This objective is accomplished by three main steps.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>1) learn word boundaries from character-based alignments; 2) encode the learned word boundaries into a GP constraint; and 3) training a CRFs model, under the GP constraint, by using the PR framework.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The empirical results indicate that the proposed model can yield better segmentations for SMT.</a>
