<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We develop a system that lets people overcome language barriers by letting them speak a language they do not know.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our system accepts text entered by a user, translates the text, then converts the translation into a phonetic spelling in the user s own orthography.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We trained the system on phonetic spellings in travel phrasebooks.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our work aims to help people speak foreign languages they don t know, by providing native phonetic spellings that approximate the sounds of foreign phrases.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use a cascade of finite-state transducers to accomplish the task.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We improve the model by adding phrases, word boundary constraints, and improved alignment.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the future, we plan to cover more language pairs and directions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Each target language raises interesting new challenges that come from its natural constraints on allowed phonemes, syllables, words, and orthography.</a>
