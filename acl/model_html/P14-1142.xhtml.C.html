<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Meanwhile, though typos are inevitable during user pinyin inputting, existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms, we propose a joint graph model to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms both existing academic and commercial IMEs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we have developed a joint graph model for pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This model finds a joint global optimal for typo correction and PTC conversion on the entire input pinyin sequence.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, the joint model is efficient enough for practical use.</a>
