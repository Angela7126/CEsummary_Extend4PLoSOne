<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While this result confirms that citation classification is feasible, there are two drawbacks to this approach i) it requires a large annotated corpus for supervised classification, which in the case of scientific literature is quite expensive; and (ii) feature engineering that is too specific to one area of scientific literature may not be portable to other domains, even within scientific literature.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper we address these two drawbacks.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we frame citation classification as a domain adaptation task and leverage the abundant labeled data available in other domains.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Then, to avoid over-engineering specific citation features for a particular scientific domain, we explore a deep learning neural network approach that has shown to generalize well across domains using unigram and bigram features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We achieve better citation classification results with this cross-domain approach than using in-domain classification.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Robust citation classification has been hindered by the relative lack of annotated data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper we successfully use a large, out-of-domain, annotated corpus to improve the citation polarity classification.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our approach uses a deep learning neural network for domain adaptation with labeled out-of-domain data and unlabeled in-domain data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This semi-supervised domain adaptation approach outperforms the in-domain citation polarity classification and other fully supervised domain adaptation approaches.</a>
