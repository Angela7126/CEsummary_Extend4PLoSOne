<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have proposed a word alignment model based on an RNN, which captures long alignment history through recurrent architectures..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Furthermore, we proposed an unsupervised method for training our model using NCE and introduced an agreement constraint that encourages word embeddings to be consistent across alignment directions..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our experiments have shown that the proposed model outperforms the FFNN-based model [ 40 ] for word alignment and machine translation, and that the agreement constraint improves alignment performance..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In future, we plan to employ contexts composed of surrounding words (e.g.,, c ( f j ) or c ( e a j ) in the FFNN-based model) in our model, even though our model implicitly encodes such contexts in the alignment history..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We also plan to enrich each hidden layer in our model with multiple layers following the success of Yang et al..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> [ 40 ] , in which multiple hidden layers improved the performance of the FFNN-based model..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In addition, we would like to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method for other datasets..</a>
