<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been increasingly focused on for their ability to alleviate the burden of manual feature engineering.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for Chinese word segmentation called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation, MMTNN has the ability to model complicated interactions between tags and context characters.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Furthermore, a new tensor factorization approach is proposed to speed up the model and avoid overfitting.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our model achieves better performances than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature engineering.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Despite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, MMTNN can be easily generalized and applied to other sequence labeling tasks.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Moreover, we propose a tensor factorization approach that effectively improves the model efficiency and avoids the risk of overfitting.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our model achieve better results than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive result with minimal feature engineering.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the future, we plan to further extend our model and apply it to other structure prediction problems.</a>
