<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper demonstrates the importance of relation equivalence for entity translation pair discovery..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Existing approach of understanding relation equivalence has focused on using explicit features of co-occurring entities..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we explore latent features of temporality for understanding relation equivalence, and empirically show that the explicit and latent features complement each other..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our proposed hybrid approach of using both explicit and latent features improves relation translation by 0.16 F1-score, and in turn improves entity translation by 0.02..</a>
