<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present CoSimRank , a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is efficient because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We present equivalent formalizations that show CoSimRank s close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank and also show how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms to compute CoSimRank..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic similarity measures..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction, CoSimRank is faster or more accurate than previous approaches..</a>
