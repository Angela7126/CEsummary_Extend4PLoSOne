<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We presented a proposal for a new learning and evaluation framework for SMT..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The central idea is to ground meaning transfer in successful interaction in an extrinsic task, and use task-based feedback for structured learning..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We presented a proof-of-concept experiment that defines the extrinsic task as executing semantic parses of translated queries against the Geoquery database..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our experiments show an improvement of about 6 points in F1-score for response-based learning over structured learning from reference translations..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our error analysis shows that response-based learning generates grammatical translations which is due to the additional use of a cost function that boosts similarity of translations to human reference translations..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In future work, we would like to extend our work on embedding SMT in virtual gameplay to larger and more diverse datasets, and involve human feedback in the response-based learning loop..</a>
