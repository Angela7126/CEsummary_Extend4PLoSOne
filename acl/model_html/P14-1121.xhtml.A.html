<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on the implicit hypothesis that corpora are balanced..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, the historical context-based projection method dedicated to this task is relatively insensitive to the sizes of each part of the comparable corpus..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Within this context, we have carried out a study on the influence of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through different experiments..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Moreover, we have introduced a regression model that boosts the observations of word co-occurrences used in the context-based projection method..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Our results show that the use of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora induces a significant gain in the quality of extracted lexicons..</a>
