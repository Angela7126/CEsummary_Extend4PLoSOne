<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Meanwhile, though typos are inevitable during user pinyin inputting, existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms, we propose a joint graph model to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms both existing academic and commercial IMEs..</a>
