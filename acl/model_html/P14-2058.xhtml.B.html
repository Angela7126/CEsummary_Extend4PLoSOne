<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we have presented a semi-automatic system for the automation of the keyword method and used it to teach 40 Italian words to 20 English native speakers..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We let the system select appropriate keywords and generate sentences automatically..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> For each Italian word, we selected the most suitable among the 10 highest ranked suggestions and used it for the evaluation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The significant reduction in retention error rate (between 17% and 45% on different word groups) for the words learned with the aid of the automatically generated sentences shows that they are a viable low-effort alternative to human-constructed examples for vocabulary teaching..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> As future work, it would be interesting to involve learners in an interactive evaluation to understand the extent to which learners can benefit from ad-hoc personalization..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Furthermore, it should be possible to use frameworks similar to the one that we presented to automate other teaching devices based on sentences conforming to specific requirements [] , such as verbal chaining and acrostic..</a>
