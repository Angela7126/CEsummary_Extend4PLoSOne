<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>With the proliferation of social media sites, social streams have proven to contain the most up-to-date information on current events.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, it is crucial to extract events from the social streams such as tweets.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, it is not straightforward to adapt the existing event extraction systems since texts in social media are fragmented and noisy.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract structured representation of events from social media.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>LEM is fully unsupervised and does not require annotated data for training.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We evaluate LEM on a Twitter corpus.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 83% in F-measure, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7%.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper we have proposed an unsupervised Bayesian model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract the structured representation of events from social media data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Instead of employing labeled corpora for training, the proposed model only requires the identification of named entities, locations and time expressions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>After that, the model can automatically extract events which involving a named entity at certain time, location, and with event-related keywords based on the co-occurrence patterns of the event elements.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Our proposed model has been evaluated on the FSD corpus.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Experimental results show our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7% in F-measure.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In future work, we plan to investigate inferring geolocations automatically from tweets.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>We also intend to study a better method to infer date more accurately from tweets and explore efficient ranking strategies to rank evens extracted for a better presentation of results.</a>
