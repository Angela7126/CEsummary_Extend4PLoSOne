<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance multi-document summarization..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We employ a fully automated temporal processing system to generate a timeline for each input document..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We derive three features from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art baseline..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition, we propose TimeMMR , a modification to Maximal Marginal Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of computing time span similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We also propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> By selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization performance is increased by a significant 5.9%..</a>
