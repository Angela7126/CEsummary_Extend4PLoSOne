<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar measurement of metaphoricity..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which represents how metaphoric that sentence is..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This measure achieves a correlation of 0.450 (Pearson s R, p 0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity involving human participants..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> While far from perfect, this scalar measure of metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> When reduced to a binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable binary classification system s 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches..</a>
