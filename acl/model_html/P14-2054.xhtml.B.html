<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we proposed two polynomial time decoding algorithms using joint inference for sentence compression..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The first one is an exact dynamic programming algorithm, and requires O ( n 6 ) running time..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This one does not show significant advantage in speed over ILP..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The second one is an approximation of the first algorithm..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> It adopts Lagrangian relaxation to eliminate the compression ratio constraint, yielding lower time complexity T O ( n 4..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In practice it achieves nearly the same accuracy as the exact one, but is much faster..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> 3 3 Our code is available at http://code.google.com/p/sent-compress/..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> The main assumption of our method is that the dependency parse tree is projective, which is not true for some other languages..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> In that case, our method is invalid, but [ 17 ] still works..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> In the future, we will study the non-projective cases based on the recent parsing techniques for 1-endpoint-crossing trees [ 14 ]..</a>
