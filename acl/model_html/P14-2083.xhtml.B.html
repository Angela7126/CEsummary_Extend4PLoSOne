<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we show that disagreements between professional or lay annotators are systematic and consistent across domains and some of them are systematic also across languages..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In addition, we present an empirical analysis of POS annotations showing that the vast majority of inter-annotator disagreements are competing, but valid, linguistic interpretations..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose to embrace such disagreements rather than using annotation guidelines to optimize inter-annotator agreement, which would bias our models in favor of some linguistic theory..</a>
