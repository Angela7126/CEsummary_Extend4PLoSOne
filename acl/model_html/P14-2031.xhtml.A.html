<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this study, we analyze links between edits in Wikipedia articles and turns from their discussion page..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our motivation is to better understand implicit details about the writing process and knowledge flow in collaboratively created resources..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Based on properties of the involved edit and turn, we have defined constraints for corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We manually annotated a corpus of 636 corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Furthermore, we show how our data can be used to automatically identify corresponding edit-turn-pairs..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> With the help of supervised machine learning, we achieve an accuracy of .87 for this task..</a>
