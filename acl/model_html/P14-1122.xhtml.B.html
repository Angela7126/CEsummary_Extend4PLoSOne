<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two video games have been presented for validating and extending knowledge bases..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The first game, Infection, validates concept-concept relations, and the second, The Knowledge Towers, validates image-concept relations..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In experiments involving online players, we demonstrate three contributions..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> First, games were released in two conditions whereby players either saw financial incentives for playing or a personal satisfaction incentive where they were thanked by us..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We demonstrated that both conditions produced nearly identical numbers of annotations and, moreover, that players were disinterested in the satisfaction incentive, suggesting they played out of interest in the game itself..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel design for games with a purpose which does not require two players for validation and instead reinforces behavior only using true negative items that required no manual annotation..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Second, in a comparison with crowdsourcing, we demonstrate that video game-based annotations consistently generated higher-quality annotations..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Last, we demonstrate that video game-based annotation can be more cost-effective than crowdsourcing or annotation tasks with game-like features..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The significant number of annotations generated by the satisfaction incentive condition shows that a fun game can generate high-quality annotations at virtually no cost..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> All annotated resources, demos of the games, and a live version of the top-ranking items for each concept are currently available online..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> 5 5 http://lcl.uniroma1.it/games/..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> In the future we will apply our video games to the validation of more data, such as the new Wikipedia bitaxonomy [ 11 ]..</a>
