<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We focus on single-relation questions and decompose each question into an entity mention and a relation pattern..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Using convolutional neural network models, we measure the similarity of entity mentions with entities in the knowledge base (KB) and the similarity of relation patterns and relations in the KB..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We score relational triples in the KB using these measures and select the top scoring relational triple to answer the question..</a>
