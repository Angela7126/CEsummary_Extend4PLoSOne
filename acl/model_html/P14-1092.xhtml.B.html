<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This work focuses on two important aspects of answer reranking for non-factoid QA similarity between question and answer content, and answer structure..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> While the former has been addressed with a variety of lexical-semantic models, the latter has received little attention..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Here we show how to model answer structures using discourse and how to integrate the two aspects into a holistic framework..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Empirically we show that modeling answer discourse structures is complementary to modeling lexical semantic similarity and that the best performance is obtained when they are tightly integrated..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple genres and question types and obtain benefits of up to 24% relative improvement over a strong baseline that combines information retrieval and lexical semantics..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We further demonstrate that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain and transfer well, even between radically different datasets..</a>
