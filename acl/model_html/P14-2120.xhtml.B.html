<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We formulated the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships within textual inference scenarios..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We compared this task to the labeling task of SemEval 2010, where no prior information about candidate arguments in the text is available..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We point out that in textual inference scenarios the candidate predicate and argument are given by the Hypothesis, while the challenge is only to verify that a predicate-argument relationship between these candidates is implied from the given Text..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Accordingly, some complex steps necessitated in the SemEval task can be avoided, while additional relevant cases are covered..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Moreover, we have shown that this simpler task is more feasibly solvable, where our 15 features achieved more than 80% accuracy..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> While our dataset and algorithm were presented in the context of RTE, the same challenge and methods are applicable to other textual inference tasks as well..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Consider, for example, the Question Answering (QA) task..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Typically QA systems detect a candidate predicate that matches the question s predicate..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Similarly, candidate arguments, which match either the expected answer type or other arguments in the question are detected too..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Consequently, our methods which exploit the availability of the candidate predicate and argument can be adapted to this scenario as well..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Similarly, a typical approach for Event Extraction (a sub task of Information Extraction ) is to start by applying an entity extractor, which identifies argument candidates..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Accordingly, candidate predicate and arguments are detected in this scenario too, while the remaining challenge is to assess the likelihood that a predicate-argument relationship holds between them..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Following this observation, we propose future work of applying our methods to other tasks..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> An additional direction for future work is to further develop new methods for our task, possibly by incorporating SRL resources and/or linguistically oriented rules, in order to improve the results we achieved so far..</a>
