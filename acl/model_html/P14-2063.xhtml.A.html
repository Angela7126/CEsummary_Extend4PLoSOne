<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Sentiment analysis in a multilingual world remains a challenging problem, because developing language-specific sentiment lexicons is an extremely resource-intensive process..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We demonstrate the performance of our lexicons in an extrinsic analysis of 2,000 distinct historical figures Wikipedia articles on 30 languages..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs..</a>
