<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We presented a metric called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC), a metric in SA research that has been unexplored until now..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> First, the process of data preparation through eye tracking, labeled with the SAC score was elaborated..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Using this data set and a set of linguistic features, we trained a regression model to predict SAC..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our predictive framework for SAC resulted in a mean percentage error of 22.02%, and a moderate correlation of 0.57 between the predicted and observed SAC values..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Finally, we observe a negative correlation between the classifier confidence scores and a SAC, as expected..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> As a future work, we would like to investigate how SAC of a test sentence can be used to choose a classifier from an ensemble, and to determine the pre-processing steps (entity-relationship extraction, for example..</a>
