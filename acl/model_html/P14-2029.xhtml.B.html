<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we developed a system for predicting grammaticality on an ordinal scale and created a labeled dataset that we have released publicly (ยง 2 ) to enable more realistic evaluations in future research..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our system outperformed an existing state-of-the-art system [ 16 ] in evaluations on binary and ordinal scales..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This is the most realistic evaluation of methods for predicting sentence-level grammaticality to date..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Surprisingly, the system from Post ( 2011 ) performed quite poorly on the GUG dataset..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We speculate that this is due to the fact that the Post system relies heavily on features extracted from automatic syntactic parses..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> While Post found that such a system can effectively distinguish grammatical news text sentences from sentences generated by a language model, measuring the grammaticality of real sentences from language learners seems to require a wider variety of features, including n -gram counts, language model scores, etc..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Of course, our findings do not indicate that syntactic features such as those from Post ( 2011 ) are without value..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In future work, it may be possible to improve grammaticality measurement by integrating such features into a larger system..</a>
