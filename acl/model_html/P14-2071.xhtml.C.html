<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we present multiple approaches to improve sentiment analysis on Twitter data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We first establish a state-of-the-art baseline with a rich feature set.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Then we build a topic-based sentiment mixture model with topic-specific data in a semi-supervised training framework.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The topic information is generated through topic modeling based on an efficient implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The proposed sentiment model outperforms the top system in the task of Sentiment Analysis in Twitter in SemEval-2013 in terms of averaged F scores * This work was done when the author was with Thomson Reuters.</a>
