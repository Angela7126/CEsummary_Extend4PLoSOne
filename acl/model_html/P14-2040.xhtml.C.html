<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper presents a method for detecting words related to a topic (we call them topic words) over time in the stream of documents.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Topic words are widely distributed in the stream of documents, and sometimes they frequently appear in the documents, and sometimes not.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a method to reinforce topic words with low frequencies by collecting documents from the corpus, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation [ 4 ] to these documents.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the results of LDA, we identified topic words by using Moving Average Convergence Divergence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In order to evaluate the method, we applied the results of topic detection to extractive multi-document summarization.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The results showed that the method was effective for sentence selection in summarization.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The research described in this paper explores a method for detecting topic words over time in series of documents.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The results of extrinsic evaluation showed that integration of LDA and MACD is effective for topic detection.</a>
