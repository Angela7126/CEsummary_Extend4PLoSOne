<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We aim to improve spoken term detection performance by incorporating contextual information beyond traditional N-gram language models.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Instead of taking a broad view of topic context in spoken documents, variability of word co-occurrence statistics across corpora leads us to focus instead the on phenomenon of word repetition within single documents.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We show that given the detection of one instance of a term we are more likely to find additional instances of that term in the same document.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We leverage this burstiness of keywords by taking the most confident keyword hypothesis in each document and interpolating with lower scoring hits.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then develop a principled approach to select interpolation weights using only the ASR training data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using this re-weighting approach we demonstrate consistent improvement in the term detection performance across all five languages in the BABEL program.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Leveraging the burstiness of content words, we have developed a simple technique to consistently boost term detection performance across languages.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using word repetitions, we effectively use a broad document context outside of the typical 2-5 N-gram window.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Furthermore, we see improvements across a broad spectrum of languages languages with syllable-based word tokens (Vietnamese, Cantonese), complex morphology (Turkish), and dialect variability (Pashto.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Secondly, our results are not only effective but also intuitive, given that the interpolation weight parameter matches our expectations for the burstiness of the word tokens in the language on which it is estimated.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We have focused primarily on re-scoring results for the term detection task.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Given the effectiveness of the technique across multiple languages, we hope to extend our effort to exploit our human tendency towards redundancy to decoding or other aspects of the spoken document processing pipeline.</a>
