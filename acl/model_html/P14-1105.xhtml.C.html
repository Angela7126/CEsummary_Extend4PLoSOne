<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Taking inspiration from recent work in sentiment analysis that successfully models the compositional aspect of language, we apply a recursive neural network ( RNN ) framework to the task of identifying the political position evinced by a sentence.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper we apply recursive neural networks to political ideology detection, a problem where previous work relies heavily on bag-of-words models and hand-designed lexica.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We show that our approach detects bias more accurately than existing methods on two different datasets.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In addition, we describe an approach to crowdsourcing ideological bias annotations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We use this approach to create a new dataset from the ibc , which is labeled at both the sentence and phrase level.</a>
