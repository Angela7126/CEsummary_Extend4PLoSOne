<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Motivated by work predicting coarse-grained author categories in social media, such as gender or political preference, we explore whether Twitter contains information to support the prediction of fine-grained categories, or social roles.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We find that the simple self-identification pattern I am a supports significantly richer classification than previously explored, successfully retrieving a variety of fine-grained roles.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For a given role (e.g.,, writer ), we can further identify characteristic attributes using a simple possessive construction (e.g.,, writer s.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Tweets that incorporate the attribute terms in first person possessives ( my ) are confirmed to be an indicator that the author holds the associated social role.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have shown that Twitter contains sufficiently robust signal to support more fine-grained author attribute prediction tasks than have previously been attempted.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our results are based on simple, intuitive search patterns with minimal additional filtering this establishes the feasibility of the task, but leaves wide room for future work, both in the sophistication in methodology as well as the diversity of roles to be targeted.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We exploited two complementary types of indicators self-identification and self-possession of conceptual class (role) attributes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Those interested in identifying latent demographics can extend and improve these indicators in developing ways to identify groups of interest within the general population of Twitter users.</a>
