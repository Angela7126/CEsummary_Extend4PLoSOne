<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we have developed a joint graph model for pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This model finds a joint global optimal for typo correction and PTC conversion on the entire input pinyin sequence..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The evaluation results show that our model outperforms both previous academic systems and existing commercial products..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition, the joint model is efficient enough for practical use..</a>
