<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language understanding..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The network uses Dynamic k -Max Pooling, a global pooling operation over linear sequences..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We test the DCNN in four experiments small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25 % error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline..</a>
