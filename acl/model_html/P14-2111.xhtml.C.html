<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Tweets often contain a large proportion of abbreviations, alternative spellings, novel words and other non-canonical language.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These features are problematic for standard language analysis tools and it can be desirable to convert them to canonical form.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a novel text normalization model based on learning edit operations from labeled data while incorporating features induced from unlabeled data via character-level neural text embeddings.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The text embeddings are generated using an Simple Recurrent Network.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We find that enriching the feature set with text embeddings substantially lowers word error rates on an English tweet normalization dataset.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our model improves on state-of-the-art with little training data and without any lexical resources.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Learning sequences of edit operations from examples while incorporating unlabeled data via neural text embeddings constitutes a compelling approach to tweet normalization.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our results are especially interesting considering that we trained on only a small annotated data set and did not use any other manually created resources such as dictionaries.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We want to push performance further by expanding the training data and incorporating existing lexical resources.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It will also be important to check how our method generalizes to other language and datasets (e.g., 5 ; 1 ).</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The general form of our model can be used in settings where normalization is not limited to word-to-word transformations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We are planning to find or create data with such characteristics and evaluate our approach under these conditions.</a>
