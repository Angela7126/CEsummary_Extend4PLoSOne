<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We present CoSimRank , a graph-theoretic similarity measure that is efficient because it can compute a single node similarity without having to compute the similarities of the entire graph.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present equivalent formalizations that show CoSimRank s close relationship to Personalized PageRank and SimRank and also show how we can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms to compute CoSimRank.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Another advantage of CoSimRank is that it can be flexibly extended from basic node-node similarity to several other graph-theoretic similarity measures.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In an experimental evaluation on the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction, CoSimRank is faster or more accurate than previous approaches.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have presented CoSimRank , a new similarity measure that can be computed for a single node pair without relying on the similarities in the whole graph.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We gave two different formalizations of CoSimRank i) a derivation from Personalized PageRank and (ii) a matrix representation that can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We also presented extensions of CoSimRank for a number of applications, thus demonstrating the flexibility of CoSimRank as a similarity measure.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We showed that CoSimRank is superior to SimRank in time and space complexity; and we demonstrated that CoSimRank performs better than PPR+cos on two similarity computation tasks.</a>
