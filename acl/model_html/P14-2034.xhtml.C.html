<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Segmentation of clitics has been shown to improve accuracy on a variety of Arabic NLP tasks.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, state-of-the-art Arabic word segmenters are either limited to formal Modern Standard Arabic, performing poorly on Arabic text featuring dialectal vocabulary and grammar, or rely on linguistic knowledge that is hand-tuned for each dialect.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We extend an existing MSA segmenter with a simple domain adaptation technique and new features in order to segment informal and dialectal Arabic text.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Experiments show that our system outperforms existing systems on newswire, broadcast news and Egyptian dialect, improving segmentation F 1 score on a recently released Egyptian Arabic corpus to 95.1%, compared to 90.8% for another segmenter designed specifically for Egyptian Arabic.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper we demonstrate substantial gains on Arabic clitic segmentation for both formal and dialectal text using a single model with dialect-independent features and a simple domain adaptation strategy.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We present a new Arabic segmenter which performs better than tools employing sophisticated linguistic analysis, while also giving impressive speed improvements.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluated our segmenter on broadcast news and Egyptian Arabic due to the current availability of annotated data in these domains.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, as data for other Arabic dialects and genres becomes available, we expect that the model s simplicity and the domain adaptation method we use will allow the system to be applied to these dialects with minimal effort and without a loss of performance in the original domains.</a>
