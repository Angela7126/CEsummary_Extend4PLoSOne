<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a novel approach to cross-lingual model transfer based on feature representation projection..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> First, a compact feature representation relevant for the task in question is constructed for either language independently and then the mapping between the two representations is determined using parallel data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The target instance can then be mapped into the source-side feature representation using the derived mapping and handled directly by the source-side model..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This approach displays competitive performance on model transfer for semantic role labeling when compared to direct model transfer and annotation projection and suggests interesting directions for further research..</a>
