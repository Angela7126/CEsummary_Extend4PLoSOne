<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this study, we analyze links between edits in Wikipedia articles and turns from their discussion page.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our motivation is to better understand implicit details about the writing process and knowledge flow in collaboratively created resources.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on properties of the involved edit and turn, we have defined constraints for corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We manually annotated a corpus of 636 corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Furthermore, we show how our data can be used to automatically identify corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>With the help of supervised machine learning, we achieve an accuracy of .87 for this task.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The novelty of this paper is a computational analysis of the relationship between the edit history and the discussion of a Wikipedia article.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As far as we are aware, this is the first study to automatically analyze this relationship involving the textual content of edits and turns.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Based on the types of turn and edit in an edit-turn-pair, we have operationalized the notion of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The basic assumption is that in a corresponding pair, the turn contains an explicit performative and the edit corresponds to this performative.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We have presented a machine learning system to automatically detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To test this system, we manually annotated a corpus of corresponding and non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Trained and tested on this data, our system shows a significant improvement over the baseline.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>With regard to future work, an extension of the manually annotated corpus is the most important issue.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Our classifier can be used to bootstrap the annotation of additional edit-turn-pairs.</a>
