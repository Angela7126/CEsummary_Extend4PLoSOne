<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The most important conclusion we draw from this work is the most appropriate agreement metric for syntactic annotation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> First of all, we disqualify the LAS metric, primarily due to the methodological inadequacies of using an uncorrected measure..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> While our experiments did not reveal any serious shortcomings (unlike those of [] who in the case of categorisation showed that for large p the uncorrected measure can be increasing ), the methodological problems of uncorrected metrics makes us wary of LAS as an agreement metric..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Next, of the three metrics, p l a i n is clearly the best; d i f f is extremely sensitive to even moderate amounts of disagreement, while n o r m is overly lenient..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Looking solely at Figure 3 , one might be led to believe that LAS and p l a i n are interchangeable, but this is not the case..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> As shown by Figures 4 and 5 , the paraboloid shape of the LAS curve in Figure 3 is simply the combination of the metric s linear responses to both label and structural perturbations..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The behaviour of on the other hand is more complex, with structural noise being penalised harder than perturbations of the labels..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Thus, the similarity of LAS and p l a i n is not at all assured when the amounts of structural and labelling disagreements differ..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Additionally, we consider this imbalanced weighting of structural and labelling disagreements a benefit, as structure is the larger part of syntactic annotation compared to the labelling of the dependencies/bracketings..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Finally our experiments show that is a single metric that is applicable to both dependencies and phrase structure trees..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Furthermore, metrics are far more flexible than simple accuracy metrics..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> The use of a distance function to define the metric means that more fine-grained distinctions can be made; for example, if the set of labels on the structures is highly structured, partial credit can be given for differing annotations that overlap..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> For example, if different types of adverbials (temporal, negation, etc.) receive different relations, as is the case in the Swedish Talbanken05 [] corpus, confusion of different adverbial types can be given less weight than confusion between subject and object..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> The -based metrics are also far easier to apply to a more complex annotation task such as the tectogrammatical annotation of the PCEDT..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> In this task inserting and deleting nodes is an integral part of the annotation, and if two annotators insert or delete different nodes the all-or-nothing requirement of identical yield of the LAS metric makes it impossible as an evaluation metric in this setting..</a>
