<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We investigate the novel task of online dispute detection and propose a sentiment analysis solution to the problem we aim to identify the sequence of sentence-level sentiments expressed during a discussion and to use them as features in a classifier that predicts the DISPUTE/NON-DISPUTE label for the discussion as a whole.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The best model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We present a sentiment analysis-based approach to online dispute detection.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We create a large-scale dispute corpus from Wikipedia Talk pages to study the problem.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A sentiment prediction model based on isotonic CRFs is proposed to output sentiment labels at the sentence-level.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Experiments on our dispute corpus also demonstrate that classifiers trained with sentiment tagging features outperform others that do not.</a>
