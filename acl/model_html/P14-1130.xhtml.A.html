<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Accurate scoring of syntactic structures such as head-modifier arcs in dependency parsing typically requires rich, high-dimensional feature representations..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> A small subset of such features is often selected manually..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This is problematic when features lack clear linguistic meaning as in embeddings or when the information is blended across features..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper, we use tensors to map high-dimensional feature vectors into low dimensional representations..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We explicitly maintain the parameters as a low-rank tensor to obtain low dimensional representations of words in their syntactic roles, and to leverage modularity in the tensor for easy training with online algorithms..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our parser consistently outperforms the Turbo and MST parsers across 14 different languages..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We also obtain the best published UAS results on 5 languages..</a>
