<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) is a framework of natural language semantics with easy-to-process structures as well as strict semantics..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this paper, we equip the DCS framework with logical inference, by defining abstract denotations as an abstraction of the computing process of denotations in original DCS..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> An inference engine is built to achieve inference on abstract denotations..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Furthermore, we propose a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference, by combining our framework with the idea of tree transformation..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiments on FraCaS and PASCAL RTE datasets show promising results..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Abstract denotations are formulas constructed from a minimal set of relational algebra [] operators, which is already able to formulate the database queries defined by DCS trees..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> For example, the semantics of students read books is given by the abstract denotation..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> where read , student and book denote sets represented by these words respectively, and w r represents the set w considered as the domain of the semantic role r (e.g., is the set of books considered as objects..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The operators and × represent intersection and Cartesian product respectively, both borrowed from relational algebra..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> It is not hard to see the abstract denotation denotes the intersection of the reading set (as illustrated by the read table in Table 1 ) with the product of student set and book set, which results in the same denotation as computed by the DCS tree in Figure 1 , i.e., { John reads Ulysses , }..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> However, the point is that F 1 itself is an algebraic formula that does not depend on any concrete databases..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Formally, we introduce the following constants..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> W a universal set containing all entities..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> Content words a content word (e.g., read ) defines a set representing the word (e.g., = { ( x , y r e a d ( x , y ) }..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> In addition we introduce following functions..</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> × the Cartesian product of two sets..</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> the intersection of two sets..</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> r projection onto domain of semantic role r (e.g., ( ) = { y x ; r e a d ( x , y ) }..</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> Generally we admit projections onto multiple semantics roles, denoted by R where R is a set of semantic roles..</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> r relabeling (e.g., ( ) = ..</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> q r the division operator, where q r ( A , B ) is defined as the largest set X which satisfies B r × X A..</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> 2 2 If A and B has the same dimension, q ( A , B ) is either or { * } ( 0 -dimension point set), depending on if A B..</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23> This is used to formulate universal quantifiers, such as Mary loves every dog and books read by all students ..</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> An abstract denotation is then defined as finite applications of functions on either constants or other abstract denotations..</a>
