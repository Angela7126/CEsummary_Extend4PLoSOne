<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose an online learning algorithm based on tensor-space models..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> A tensor-space model represents data in a compact way, and via rank-1 approximation the weight tensor can be made highly structured, resulting in a significantly smaller number of free parameters to be estimated than in comparable vector-space models..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This regularizes the model complexity and makes the tensor model highly effective in situations where a large feature set is defined but very limited resources are available for training..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We apply with the proposed algorithm to a parsing task, and show that even with very little training data the learning algorithm based on a tensor model performs well, and gives significantly better results than standard learning algorithms based on traditional vector-space models..</a>
