<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Analyses of filler-gap dependencies usually involve complex syntactic rules or heuristics; however recent results suggest that filler-gap comprehension begins earlier than seemingly simpler constructions such as ditransitives or passives..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Therefore, this work models filler-gap acquisition as a byproduct of learning word orderings (e.g., SVO vs OSV), which must be done at a very young age anyway in order to extract meaning from language..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Specifically, this model, trained on part-of-speech tags, represents the preferred locations of semantic roles relative to a verb as Gaussian mixtures over real numbers..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This approach learns role assignment in filler-gap constructions in a manner consistent with current developmental findings and is extremely robust to initialization variance..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Additionally, this model is shown to be able to account for a characteristic error made by learners during this period ( A and B gorped interpreted as A gorped B..</a>
