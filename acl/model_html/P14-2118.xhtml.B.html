<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have shown that objective adjectives are most likely to modify concrete nouns, and that non-literal combinations can emerge when this principle is violated (Section 3..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Indeed, the occurrence of an adjective with a more abstract noun than those it typically modifies is a strikingly consistent indicator of metaphoricity (Table 2..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In addition, we showed that both concreteness and subjectivity improve the automatic classification of adjective-noun pairs according to compositionality or modification type (Section 4..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Importantly, a classifier with both subjectivity and concreteness features outperforms concreteness-only classifiers, including those proposed in previous work..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The results underline the relevance of both subjectivity and concreteness to lexical and phrasal semantics, and their application to language processing tasks..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We hypothesize that concreteness and subjectivity are fundamental to human language processing because language is precisely the conveyance of information about the world from one party to another..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In decoding this signal, it is clearly informative to understand to what extent the information refers directly to the world, and also to what extent it reports a fact versus an opinion..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We believe these dimensions will ultimately prove essential for computational systems aiming to replicate human performance in interpreting language..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> As the results suggest, they may be particularly important for capturing the intricacies of semantic composition and thus extending representations beyond the lexeme..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Of course, two dimensions alone are not sufficient to reflect all of the subtleties of adjective and noun semantics..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> For instance, our model classifies white spirit , a transparent cleaning product, as non-literal, since the lexical concreteness score does not allow for strong noun polysemy..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Further, it makes no allowance for wider sentential context, which can be an important clue to modification type in such cases..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> We aim to address these limitations in future work by integrating subjectivity and concreteness with conventially acquired semantic representations, and, ultimately, models that integrate input corresponding to the perceptual modalities..</a>
