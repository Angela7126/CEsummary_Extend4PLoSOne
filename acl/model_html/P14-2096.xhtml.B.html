<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Cross-language article linking is the task of creating links between online encyclopedia articles in different languages that describe the same content..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We propose a method based on article hypernym and topic model to link English Wikipedia articles to corresponding Chinese Baidu Baike articles..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our method comprises two stages candidate selection and candidate ranking..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We formulate candidate selection as a cross-language information retrieval task based on the title similarity between English and Chinese articles..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In candidate ranking, we employ several features of the articles in our SVM model..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> To evaluate our method, we compile a dataset from English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, containing the 500 most popular Baidu articles..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Evaluation results of our method show an MRR of up to 80.95% and a recall of 87.46%..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> This shows that our method is effective in generating cross-language links between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike with high accuracy..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different encyclopedias in other languages..</a>
