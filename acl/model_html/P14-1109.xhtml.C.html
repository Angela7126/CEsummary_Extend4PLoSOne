<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Earnings call summarizes the financial performance of a company, and it is an important indicator of the future financial risks of the company.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We quantitatively study how earnings calls are correlated with the financial risks, with a special focus on the financial crisis of 2009.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In particular, we perform a text regression task given the transcript of an earnings call, we predict the volatility of stock prices from the week after the call is made.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose the use of copula a powerful statistical framework that separately models the uniform marginals and their complex multivariate stochastic dependencies, while not requiring any prior assumptions on the distributions of the covariate and the dependent variable.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By performing probability integral transform , our approach moves beyond the standard count-based bag-of-words models in NLP, and improves previous work on text regression by incorporating the correlation among local features in the form of semiparametric Gaussian copula.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In experiments, we show that our model significantly outperforms strong linear and non-linear discriminative baselines on three datasets under various settings.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this work, we have demonstrated that the more complex quarterly earnings calls can also be used to predict the measured volatility of the stocks in the limited future.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We propose a novel semiparametric Gausian copula regression approach that models the dependency structure of the language in the earnings calls.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unlike traditional bag-of-features models that work discrete features from various signals, we perform kernel density estimation to smooth out the distribution, and use probability integral transform to work with CDFs that are uniform.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The copula model deals with marginal CDFs and the correlation among them separately, in a cleaner manner that is also flexible to parameterize.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Focusing on the three financial crisis related datasets, the proposed model significantly outperform the standard linear regression method in statistics and strong discriminative support vector regression baselines.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>By varying the size of the training data and the dimensionality of the covariates, we have demonstrated that our proposed model is relatively robust across different parameter settings.</a>
