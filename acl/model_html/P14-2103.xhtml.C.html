<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper introduces an unsupervised graph-based method that selects textual labels for automatically generated topics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our approach uses the topic keywords to query a search engine and generate a graph from the words contained in the results.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>PageRank is then used to weigh the words in the graph and score the candidate labels.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The state-of-the-art method for this task is supervised [ 14 ].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Evaluation on a standard data set shows that the performance of our approach is consistently superior to previously reported methods.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We described an unsupervised graph-based method to associate textual labels with automatically generated topics.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our approach uses results retrieved from a search engine using the topic keywords as a query.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A graph is generated from the words contained in the search results metadata and candidate labels ranked using the PageRank algorithm.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Evaluation on a standard data set shows that our method consistently outperforms the supervised state-of-the-art method for the task.</a>
