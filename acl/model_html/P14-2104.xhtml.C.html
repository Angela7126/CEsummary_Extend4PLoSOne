<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we introduce a semantic role labeler for Korean, an agglutinative language with rich morphology.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, we create a novel training source by semantically annotating a Korean corpus containing fine-grained morphological and syntactic information.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then develop a supervised SRL model by leveraging morphological features of Korean that tend to correspond with semantic roles.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our model also employs a variety of latent morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These elements lead to state-of-the-art performance of 81.07% labeled F1, representing the best SRL performance reported to date for an agglutinative language.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For Korean SRL, we semantically annotated a corpus containing detailed morphological annotation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We then developed a supervised model which leverages Korean-specific features and a variety of latent morpheme representations to help deal with a sparsity problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our best model achieved 81.07% in F1-score.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the future, we will continue to build our corpus and look for the way to use unsupervised learning for SRL to apply to another language which does not have available corpus.</a>
