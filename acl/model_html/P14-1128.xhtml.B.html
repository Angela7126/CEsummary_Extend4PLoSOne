<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposed a novel CWS model for the SMT task..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This model aims to maintain the linguistic segmentation supervisions from treebank data and simultaneously integrate useful bilingual segmentations induced from the bitexts..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This objective is accomplished by three main steps..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> 1) learn word boundaries from character-based alignments; 2) encode the learned word boundaries into a GP constraint; and 3) training a CRFs model, under the GP constraint, by using the PR framework..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The empirical results indicate that the proposed model can yield better segmentations for SMT..</a>
