<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a novel technique for semantic frame identification using distributed representations of predicates and their syntactic context; this technique leverages automatic syntactic parses and a generic set of word embeddings..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Given labeled data annotated with frame-semantic parses, we learn a model that projects the set of word representations for the syntactic context around a predicate to a low dimensional representation..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The latter is used for semantic frame identification; with a standard argument identification method inspired by prior work, we achieve state-of-the-art results on FrameNet-style frame-semantic analysis..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Additionally, we report strong results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling in comparison to prior work..</a>
