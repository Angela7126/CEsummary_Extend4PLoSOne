<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a method to jointly learn features and weights directly from distributional data in a log-linear framework..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Specifically, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian model for learning phonological markedness constraints directly from the distribution of input-output mappings in an Optimality Theory (OT) setting..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The model uses an Indian Buffet Process prior to learn the feature values used in the log-linear method, and is the first algorithm for learning phonological constraints without presupposing constraint structure..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The model learns a system of constraints that explains observed data as well as the phonologically-grounded constraints of a standard analysis, with a violation structure corresponding to the standard constraints..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> These results suggest an alternative data-driven source for constraints instead of a fully innate constraint set..</a>
