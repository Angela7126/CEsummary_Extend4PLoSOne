<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In the process of semantic composition, the impact of negators is complicated by the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative study of the behavior of negators through a unified view of fitting human annotation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We first measure the modeling capabilities of two influential heuristics on a sentiment treebank and find that they capture some effect of negation; however, extending these non-lexicalized models to be dependent on the negators improves the performance statistically significantly..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The detailed analysis reveals the differences in the behavior among negators, and we argue that they should always be modeled separately..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We further make the models to be dependent on the text being modified by negators, through adaptation of a state-of-the-art recursive neural network to incorporate the syntax and semantics of the arguments; we discover this further reduces fitting errors..</a>
