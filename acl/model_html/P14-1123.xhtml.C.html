<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Designing measures that capture various aspects of language ability is a central task in the design of systems for automatic scoring of spontaneous speech.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this study, we address a key aspect of language proficiency assessment syntactic complexity.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a novel measure of syntactic complexity for spontaneous speech that shows optimum empirical performance on real world data in multiple ways.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, it is both robust and reliable , producing automatic scores that agree well with human rating compared to the state-of-the-art.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Second, the measure makes sense theoretically, both from algorithmic and native language acquisition points of view.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Seeking alternatives to measuring syntactic complexity of spoken responses via syntactic parsers, we study a shallow-analysis based approach for use in automatic scoring.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Empirically, we show that the proposed measure, based on a maximum entropy classification, satisfied the constraints of the design of an objective measure to a high degree.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, the proposed measure was found to be relatively robust to ASR errors.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The measure outperformed a related measure of syntactic complexity (also based on shallow-analysis of spoken response) previously found to be well-suited for automatic scoring.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Including the measure of syntactic complexity in an automatic scoring model resulted in statistically significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We also make an interesting observation that the impressionistic evaluation of syntactic complexity is better approximated by the presence or absence of grammar and usage patterns (and not by their frequency of occurrence), an idea supported by studies in native language acquisition.</a>
