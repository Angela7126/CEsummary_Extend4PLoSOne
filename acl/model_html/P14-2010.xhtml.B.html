<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we propose a novel algorithm that classifies documents based on class labels over few topics..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This reduces the need to label a large collection of documents..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We have used the idea of sprinkling originally proposed in the context of supervised Latent Semantic Analysis, but the setting here is quite different..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Unlike the work in (Chakraborti et al., 2007), we do not assume that we have class labels over the set of training documents..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Instead, to realize our goal of reducing knowledge acquisition overhead, we propose a way of propagating knowledge of few topic labels to the words and inducing a new topic distribution that has its topics more closely aligned to the class labels..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The results show that the approach can yield performance comparable to entirely supervised settings..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In future work, we also envision the possibility of sprinkling knowledge from background knowledge sources like Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) to realize an alignment of topics to Wikipedia concepts..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We would like to study effect of change in number of topics on the text classification performance..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> We will also explore techniques which will help annotators to encode their domain knowledge efficiently when the topics are not well aligned to the class labels..</a>
