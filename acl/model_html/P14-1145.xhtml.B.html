<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have introduced a novel formulation of lexicon induction operating over both words and senses, by exploiting the innate structure between the words and senses as encoded in WordNet..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In addition, we introduce the use of loopy belief propagation over pairwise -Markov Random Fields as an effective lexicon induction algorithm..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> A notable strength of our approach is its expressiveness various types of prior knowledge and lexical relations can be encoded as node potentials and edge potentials..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition, it leads to a lexicon of better quality while also offering faster run-time and easiness of implementation..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The resulting lexicon, called ConnotationWordNet , is the first lexicon that has polarity labels over both words and senses..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> ConnotationWordNet is publicly available for research and practical use..</a>
