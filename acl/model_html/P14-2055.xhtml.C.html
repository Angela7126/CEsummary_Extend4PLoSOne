<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to summarize a document, it is often useful to have a background set of documents from the domain to serve as a reference for determining new and important information in the input document.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a model based on Bayesian surprise which provides an intuitive way to identify surprising information from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Specifically, the method quantifies the degree to which pieces of information in the input change one s beliefs about the world represented in the background.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We develop systems for generic and update summarization based on this idea.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our method provides competitive content selection performance with particular advantages in the update task where systems are given a small and topical background corpus.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have introduced a Bayesian summarization method that strongly aligns with intuitions about how people use existing knowledge to identify important events or content in new observations.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our method is especially valuable when a system must utilize a small background corpus.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>While the update task datasets we have used were carefully selected and grouped by NIST assesors into initial and background sets, for systems on the web, there is little control over the number of background documents on a particular topic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A system should be able to use smaller amounts of background information and as new data arrives, be able to incorporate the evidence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our Bayesian approach is a natural fit in such a setting.</a>
