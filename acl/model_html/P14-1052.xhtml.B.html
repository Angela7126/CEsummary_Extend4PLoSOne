<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have proposed STRUCT, a general-purpose natural language generation system which is comparable to current state-of-the-art generators..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> STRUCT formalizes the generation problem as an MDP and applies a version of the UCT algorithm, a fast online MDP planner, to solve it..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Thus, STRUCT naturally handles probabilistic grammars..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We demonstrate empirically that STRUCT is anytime, comparable to existing generation-as-planning systems in certain NLG tasks, and is also capable of handling other, more complex tasks such as negated communicative goals..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Though STRUCT has many interesting properties, many directions for exploration remain..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Among other things, it would be desirable to integrate STRUCT with discourse planning and dialog systems..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Fortunately, reinforcement learning has already been investigated in such contexts [ 13 ] , indicating that an MDP-based generation procedure could be a natural fit in more complex generation systems..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> This is a primary direction for future work..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> A second direction is that, due to the nature of the approach, STRUCT is highly amenable to parallelization..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> None of the experiments reported here use parallelization, however, to be fair to CRISP..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> We plan to parallelize STRUCT in future work, to take advantage of current multicore architectures..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> This should obviously further reduce generation time..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> STRUCT is open source and available from github.com upon request..</a>
