<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We present a new approach to inducing the syntactic categories of words, combining their distributional and morphological properties in a joint nonparametric Bayesian model based on the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The prior distribution over word clusterings uses a log-linear model of morphological similarity; the likelihood function is the probability of generating vector word embeddings.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The weights of the morphology model are learned jointly while inducing part-of-speech clusters, encouraging them to cohere with the distributional features.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The resulting algorithm outperforms competitive alternatives on English POS induction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This paper demonstrates that morphology and distributional features can be combined in a flexible, joint probabilistic model, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A key advantage of this framework is the ability to include arbitrary features in the prior distribution.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Future work may exploit this advantage more thoroughly for example, by using features that incorporate prior knowledge of the language s morphological structure.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Another important goal is the evaluation of this method on languages beyond English.</a>
