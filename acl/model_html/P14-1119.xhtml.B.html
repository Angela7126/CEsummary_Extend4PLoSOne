<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have presented a survey of the state of the art in automatic keyphrase extraction..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> While unsupervised approaches have started to rival their supervised counterparts in performance, the task is far from being solved, as reflected by the fairly poor state-of-the-art results on various commonly-used evaluation datasets..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our analysis revealed that there are at least three major challenges ahead..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> While much recent work has focused on algorithmic development, keyphrase extractors need to have a deeper understanding of a document in order to reach the next level of performance..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Such an understanding can be facilitated by the incorporation of background knowledge..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> While it may be possible to design better algorithms to handle the large number of candidates in long documents, we believe that employing sophisticated features, especially those that encode background knowledge, will enable keyphrases and non-keyphrases to be distinguished more easily even in the presence of a large number of candidates..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> To more accurately measure the performance of keyphrase extractors, they should not be penalized for evaluation errors..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We have suggested several possibilities as to how this problem can be addressed..</a>
