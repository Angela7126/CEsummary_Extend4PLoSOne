<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have proposed STRUCT, a general-purpose natural language generation system which is comparable to current state-of-the-art generators.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>STRUCT formalizes the generation problem as an MDP and applies a version of the UCT algorithm, a fast online MDP planner, to solve it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, STRUCT naturally handles probabilistic grammars.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We demonstrate empirically that STRUCT is anytime, comparable to existing generation-as-planning systems in certain NLG tasks, and is also capable of handling other, more complex tasks such as negated communicative goals.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Though STRUCT has many interesting properties, many directions for exploration remain.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Among other things, it would be desirable to integrate STRUCT with discourse planning and dialog systems.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Fortunately, reinforcement learning has already been investigated in such contexts [ 13 ] , indicating that an MDP-based generation procedure could be a natural fit in more complex generation systems.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This is a primary direction for future work.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A second direction is that, due to the nature of the approach, STRUCT is highly amenable to parallelization.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>None of the experiments reported here use parallelization, however, to be fair to CRISP.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We plan to parallelize STRUCT in future work, to take advantage of current multicore architectures.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This should obviously further reduce generation time.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>STRUCT is open source and available from github.com upon request.</a>
