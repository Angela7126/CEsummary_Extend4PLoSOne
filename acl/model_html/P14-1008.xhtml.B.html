<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have presented a method of deriving abstract denotation from DCS trees, which enables logical inference on DCS, and we developed a textual inference system based on the framework..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Experimental results have shown the power of the representation that allows both strict inference as on FraCaS data and robust reasoning as on RTE data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Exploration of an appropriate meaning representation for querying and reasoning on knowledge bases has a long history..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Description logic, being less expressive than FOL but featuring more efficient reasoning, is used as a theory base for Semantic Web []..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Ideas similar to our framework, including the use of sets in a representation that benefits efficient reasoning, are also found in description logic and knowledge representation community []..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> To our knowledge, however, their applications to logical inference beyond the use for database querying have not been much explored in the context of NLP..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The pursue of a logic more suitable for natural language inference is not new..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> For instance, has implemented a model of natural logic []..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> While being computationally efficient, various inference patterns are out of the scope of their system..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Much work has been done in mapping natural language into database queries []..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Among these, the ( -)DCS [] framework defines algorithms that transparently map a labeled tree to a database querying procedure..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> Essentially, this is because DCS trees restrict the querying process to a very limited subset of possible operations..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Our main contribution, the abstract denotation of DCS trees, can thus be considered as an attempt to characterize a fragment of FOL that is suited for both natural language inference and transparent syntax-semantics mapping, through the choice of operations and relations on sets..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> We have demonstrated the utility of logical inference on DCS through the RTE task..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> A wide variety of strategies tackling the RTE task have been investigated [] , including the comparison of surface strings [] , syntactic and semantic structures [] , semantic vectors [] and logical representations []..</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> Acquisition of basic knowledge for RTE is also a huge stream of research []..</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17> These previous works include various techniques for acquiring and incorporating different kinds of linguistic and world knowledge, and further fight against the knowledge bottleneck problem, e.g., by back-off to shallower representations..</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18> Logic-based RTE systems employ various approaches to bridge knowledge gaps proposes features from a model builder; proposes an abduction process; shows handcrafted rules could drastically improve the performance of a logic-based RTE system..</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19> As such, our current RTE system is at a proof-of-concept stage, in that many of the above techniques are yet to be implemented..</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20> Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize that it already shows performance competitive to state-of-the-art systems on one data set (RTE5..</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21> Other directions of our future work include further exploitation of the new semantic representation..</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22> For example, since abstract denotations are readily suited for data querying, they can be used to verify newly generated assumptions by fact search in a database..</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23> This may open a way towards a hybrid approach to RTE wherein logical inference is intermingled with large scale database querying..</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24> This research was supported by the Todai Robot Project at National Institute of Informatics..</a>
