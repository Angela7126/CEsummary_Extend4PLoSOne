<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Although the distributional hypothesis has been applied successfully in many natural language processing tasks, systems using distributional information have been limited to a single domain because the distribution of a word can vary between domains as the word s predominant meaning changes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, if it were possible to predict how the distribution of a word changes from one domain to another, the predictions could be used to adapt a system trained in one domain to work in another.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose an unsupervised method to predict the distribution of a word in one domain, given its distribution in another domain.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We evaluate our method on two tasks cross-domain part-of-speech tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In both tasks, our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines and returns results that are statistically comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring no task-specific customisations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We proposed a method to predict the distribution of a word across domains.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We first create a distributional representation for a word using the data from a single domain, and then learn a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model to predict the distribution of a word in a target domain given its distribution in a source domain.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We evaluated the proposed method in two domain adaptation tasks cross-domain POS tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our experiments show that without requiring any task-specific customisations to our distribution prediction method, it outperforms competitive baselines and achieves comparable results to the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.</a>
