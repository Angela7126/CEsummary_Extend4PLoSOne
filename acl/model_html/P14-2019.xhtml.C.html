<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we report our preliminary efforts in building an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the corpus, we manually generated parallel trees for about 5,000 sentences from Penn Treebank.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>English sentences in our set have a maximum of 15 tokens, including punctuation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We constrained the translated trees to the reordering of the children and the replacement of the leaf nodes with appropriate glosses.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also report the tools that we built and used in our tree translation task.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Parallel treebank construction efforts increased significantly in the recent years.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Many parallel treebanks are produced to build statistically strong language models for different languages.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this study, we report our preliminary efforts to build such a parallel corpus for Turkish-English pair.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We translated and transformed a subset of parse trees of Penn Treebank to Turkish.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We cover more than 50% of all sentences with a maximum length of 15-words including punctuation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This work constitutes the preliminary step of parallel treebank generation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As a next step, we will focus on morphological analysis and disambiguation of Turkish words.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>After determining the correct morphological analysis of Turkish words, we will use the parts of these analyses to replace the leaf nodes that we intentionally left as *NONE* .</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As a future work, we plan to expand the dataset to include all Penn Treebank sentences.</a>
