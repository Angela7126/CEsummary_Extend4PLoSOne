<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a robust answer reranking model for non-factoid questions that integrates lexical semantics with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains one from Yahoo.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of non-factoid questions manner and reason.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We experimentally demonstrate that the discourse structure of non-factoid answers provides information that is complementary to lexical semantic similarity between question and answer, improving performance up to 24% (relative) over a state-of-the-art model that exploits lexical semantic similarity alone.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We further demonstrate excellent domain transfer of discourse information, suggesting these discourse features have general utility to non-factoid question answering.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This work focuses on two important aspects of answer reranking for non-factoid QA similarity between question and answer content, and answer structure.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While the former has been addressed with a variety of lexical-semantic models, the latter has received little attention.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Here we show how to model answer structures using discourse and how to integrate the two aspects into a holistic framework.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Empirically we show that modeling answer discourse structures is complementary to modeling lexical semantic similarity and that the best performance is obtained when they are tightly integrated.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We evaluate the proposed approach on multiple genres and question types and obtain benefits of up to 24% relative improvement over a strong baseline that combines information retrieval and lexical semantics.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We further demonstrate that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain and transfer well, even between radically different datasets.</a>
