<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Automatically detecting verbal irony (roughly, sarcasm) is a challenging task because ironists say something other than and often opposite to what they actually mean..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Discerning ironic intent exclusively from the words and syntax comprising texts (e.g.,, tweets, forum posts) is therefore not always possible additional contextual information about the speaker and/or the topic at hand is often necessary..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We introduce a new corpus that provides empirical evidence for this claim..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We show that annotators frequently require context to make judgements concerning ironic intent, and that machine learning approaches tend to misclassify those same comments for which annotators required additional context..</a>
