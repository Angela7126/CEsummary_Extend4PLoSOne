<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Answering natural language questions using the Freebase knowledge base has recently been explored as a platform for advancing the state of the art in open domain semantic parsing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Those efforts map questions to sophisticated meaning representations that are then attempted to be matched against viable answer candidates in the knowledge base.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Here we show that relatively modest information extraction techniques, when paired with a web-scale corpus, can outperform these sophisticated approaches by roughly 34% relative gain.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We proposed an automatic method for Question Answering from structured data source (Freebase.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our approach associates question features with answer patterns described by Freebase and has achieved state-of-the-art results on a balanced and realistic QA corpus.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To compensate for the problem of domain mismatch or overfitting, we exploited ClueWeb, mined mappings between KB relations and natural language text, and showed that it helped both relation prediction and answer extraction.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our method employs relatively lightweight machinery but has good performance.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We hope that this result establishes a new baseline against which semantic parsing researchers can measure their progress towards deeper language understanding and answering of human questions.</a>
