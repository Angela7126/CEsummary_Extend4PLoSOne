<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Frequently, such resources are constructed through automatic mergers of complementary resources, such as WordNet and Wikipedia..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> However, manually validating these resources is prohibitively expensive, even when using methods such as crowdsourcing..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We propose a cost-effective method of validating and extending knowledge bases using video games with a purpose..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Two video games were created to validate concept-concept and concept-image relations..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In experiments comparing with crowdsourcing, we show that video game-based validation consistently leads to higher-quality annotations, even when players are not compensated..</a>
