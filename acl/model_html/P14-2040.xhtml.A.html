<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper presents a method for detecting words related to a topic (we call them topic words) over time in the stream of documents..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Topic words are widely distributed in the stream of documents, and sometimes they frequently appear in the documents, and sometimes not..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose a method to reinforce topic words with low frequencies by collecting documents from the corpus, and applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation [ 4 ] to these documents..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> For the results of LDA, we identified topic words by using Moving Average Convergence Divergence..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In order to evaluate the method, we applied the results of topic detection to extractive multi-document summarization..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The results showed that the method was effective for sentence selection in summarization..</a>
