<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Special domains such as patents or Wikipedia offer the possibility to extract cross-lingual relevance data from citation and link graphs..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> These data can be used to directly optimizing cross-lingual ranking models..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We showed on two different large-scale ranking scenarios that a supervised combination of orthogonal information sources such as domain-knowledge, translation knowledge, and ranking-specific word associations by far outperforms a pipeline of query translation and retrieval..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We conjecture that if these types of information sources are available, a supervised ranking approach will yield superior results in other retrieval scenarios as well..</a>
