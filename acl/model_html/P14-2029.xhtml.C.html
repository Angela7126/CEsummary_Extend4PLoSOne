<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automated methods for identifying whether sentences are grammatical have various potential applications (e.g.,, machine translation, automated essay scoring, computer-assisted language learning.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we construct a statistical model of grammaticality using various linguistic features (e.g.,, misspelling counts, parser outputs, n -gram language model scores.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also present a new publicly available dataset of learner sentences judged for grammaticality on an ordinal scale.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In evaluations, we compare our system to the one from Post ( 2011 ) and find that our approach yields state-of-the-art performance.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we developed a system for predicting grammaticality on an ordinal scale and created a labeled dataset that we have released publicly ( 2 ) to enable more realistic evaluations in future research.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our system outperformed an existing state-of-the-art system [ 16 ] in evaluations on binary and ordinal scales.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is the most realistic evaluation of methods for predicting sentence-level grammaticality to date.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Surprisingly, the system from Post ( 2011 ) performed quite poorly on the GUG dataset.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We speculate that this is due to the fact that the Post system relies heavily on features extracted from automatic syntactic parses.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While Post found that such a system can effectively distinguish grammatical news text sentences from sentences generated by a language model, measuring the grammaticality of real sentences from language learners seems to require a wider variety of features, including n -gram counts, language model scores, etc.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Of course, our findings do not indicate that syntactic features such as those from Post ( 2011 ) are without value.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In future work, it may be possible to improve grammaticality measurement by integrating such features into a larger system.</a>
