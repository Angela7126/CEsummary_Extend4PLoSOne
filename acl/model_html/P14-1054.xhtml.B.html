<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, We proposed a novel Omni-word feature taking advantages of Chinese sub-phrases..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We also introduced the soft constraint method for Chinese relation recognition..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Both the Omni-word feature and soft constrain make better use of information a sentence has, and minimize the deficiency caused by Chinese segmentation and parsing..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The size of the employed lexicon determines the dimension of the feature space..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The first impression is that more lexicon entries result in more power..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> However, more lexicon entries also increase the computational complexity and bring in noises..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In our future work, we will study this issue..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The notion of soft constraints can also be extended to include more patterns, rules, regexes or syntactic constraints that have been used for information extraction..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> The usability of these strategies is also left for future work..</a>
