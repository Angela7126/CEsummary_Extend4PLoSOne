<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best output from the decoder..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we expand our translation options by desegmenting n -best lists or lattices..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm effectively combines both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs, which allows for inclusion of features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM..</a>
