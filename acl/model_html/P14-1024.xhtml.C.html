<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We show that it is possible to reliably discriminate whether a syntactic construction is meant literally or metaphorically using lexical semantic features of the words that participate in the construction.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our model is constructed using English resources, and we obtain state-of-the-art performance relative to previous work in this language.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using a model transfer approach by pivoting through a bilingual dictionary, we show our model can identify metaphoric expressions in other languages.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We provide results on three new test sets in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results support the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual, rather than lexical, in nature.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The key contribution of our work is that we show how to identify metaphors across languages by building a model in English and applying it without adaptation to other languages.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Spanish, Farsi, and Russian.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This model uses language-independent (rather than lexical or language specific) conceptual features.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Not only do we establish benchmarks for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian, but we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in English.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In addition, we present a comparison of relative contributions of several types of features.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We concentrate on metaphors in the context of two kinds of syntactic relations subject-verb-object (SVO) relations and adjective-noun (AN) relations, which account for a majority of all metaphorical phrases.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Future work will expand the scope of metaphor identification by including nominal metaphoric relations as well as explore techniques for incorporating contextual features, which can play a key role in identifying certain kinds of metaphors.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Second, cross-lingual model transfer can be improved with more careful cross-lingual feature projection.</a>
