<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an online learning algorithm based on tensor-space models.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A tensor-space model represents data in a compact way, and via rank-1 approximation the weight tensor can be made highly structured, resulting in a significantly smaller number of free parameters to be estimated than in comparable vector-space models.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This regularizes the model complexity and makes the tensor model highly effective in situations where a large feature set is defined but very limited resources are available for training.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We apply with the proposed algorithm to a parsing task, and show that even with very little training data the learning algorithm based on a tensor model performs well, and gives significantly better results than standard learning algorithms based on traditional vector-space models.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we reformulated the traditional linear vector-space models as tensor-space models, and proposed an online learning algorithm named Tensor-MIRA.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A tensor-space model is a compact representation of data, and via rank-1 tensor approximation, the weight tensor can be made highly structured hence the number of parameters to be trained is significantly reduced.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This can be regarded as a form of model regularization.Therefore, compared with the traditional vector-space models, learning in the tensor space is very effective when a large feature set is defined, but only small amount of training data is available.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our experimental results corroborated this argument.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As mentioned in Section 3.2 , one interesting problem that merits further investigation is how to determine optimal mode sizes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The challenge of applying a tensor model comes from finding a proper tensor structure for a given problem, and the key to solving this problem is to find a balance between the model complexity (indicated by the order and sizes of modes) and the number of parameters.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Developing a theoretically guaranteed approach of finding the optimal structure for a given task will make the tensor model not only perform well in low-resource environments, but adaptive to larger data sets.</a>
