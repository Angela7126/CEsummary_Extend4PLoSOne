<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Unsupervised word sense disambiguation ( wsd ) methods are an attractive approach to all-words wsd due to their non-reliance on expensive annotated data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Unsupervised estimates of sense frequency have been shown to be very useful for wsd due to the skewed nature of word sense distributions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper presents a fully unsupervised topic modelling-based approach to sense frequency estimation, which is highly portable to different corpora and sense inventories, in being applicable to any part of speech, and not requiring a hierarchical sense inventory, parsing or parallel text.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method over the tasks of predominant sense learning and sense distribution acquisition, and also the novel tasks of detecting senses which aren t attested in the corpus, and identifying novel senses in the corpus which aren t captured in the sense inventory.</a>
