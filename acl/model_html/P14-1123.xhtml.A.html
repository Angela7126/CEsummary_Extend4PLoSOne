<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Designing measures that capture various aspects of language ability is a central task in the design of systems for automatic scoring of spontaneous speech..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this study, we address a key aspect of language proficiency assessment syntactic complexity..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose a novel measure of syntactic complexity for spontaneous speech that shows optimum empirical performance on real world data in multiple ways..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> First, it is both robust and reliable , producing automatic scores that agree well with human rating compared to the state-of-the-art..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Second, the measure makes sense theoretically, both from algorithmic and native language acquisition points of view..</a>
