<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper presents the first computationally-derived scalar measurement of metaphoricity.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Each input sentence is given a value between 0 and 1 which represents how metaphoric that sentence is.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This measure achieves a correlation of 0.450 (Pearson s R, p 0.01) with an experimental measure of metaphoricity involving human participants.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While far from perfect, this scalar measure of metaphoricity allows different thresholds for metaphoricity so that metaphor identification can be fitted for specific tasks and datasets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When reduced to a binary classification evaluation using the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, the system achieves an F-Measure of 0.608, slightly lower than the comparable binary classification system s 0.638 and competitive with existing approaches.</a>
