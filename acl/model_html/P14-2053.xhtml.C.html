<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We describe an automatic question generator that uses semantic pattern recognition to create questions of varying depth and type for self-study or tutoring.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Throughout, we explore how linguistic considerations inform system design.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the described system, semantic role labels of source sentences are used in a domain-independent manner to generate both questions and answers related to the source sentence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Evaluation results show a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to the best prior systems, averaging over all metrics, and up to 61% reduction in the error rate on grammaticality judgments.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Roediger and Pyc (2012) advocate assisting students in building a strong knowledge base because creative discoveries are unlikely to occur when students do not have a sound set of facts and principles at their command.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To that end, automatic question generation systems can facilitate the learning process by alternating passages of text with questions that reinforce the material learned.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have demonstrated a semantic approach to automatic question generation that outperforms similar systems.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We evaluated our system on text extracted from open domain STEM textbooks rather than hand-crafted text, showing the robustness of our approach.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our system achieved a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to both the Heilman and Smith, and the Lindberg et al system on the average over all metrics.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The results shows are statistically significant (p 0.001.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Our question generator can be used for self-study or tutoring, or by teachers to generate questions for classroom discussion or assessment.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Finally, we addressed linguistic challenges to question generation.</a>
