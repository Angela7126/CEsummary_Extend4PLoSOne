<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Multi-document summarization (MDS) systems have been designed for short, unstructured summaries of 10-15 documents, and are inadequate for larger document collections.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a new approach to scaling up summarization called hierarchical summarization , and present the first implemented system, Summa.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Summa produces a hierarchy of relatively short summaries, in which the top level provides a general overview and users can navigate the hierarchy to drill down for more details on topics of interest.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Summa optimizes for coherence as well as coverage of salient information.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In an Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation, users prefered Summa ten times as often as flat MDS and three times as often as timelines.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have introduced a new paradigm for large-scale summarization called hierarchical summarization, which allows a user to navigate a hierarchy of relatively short summaries.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We present Summa , an implemented hierarchical news summarization system, 7 7 http://knowitall.cs.washington.edu/summa/ and demonstrate its effectiveness in a user study that compares Summa with a timeline system and a flat MDS system.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When compared to timelines, users learned more with Summa in twice as many cases, and Summa was preferred more than three times as often.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>When compared to flat summaries, users overwhelming preferred Summa and learned just as much.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This first implementation performs temporal clustering in future work, we will investigate dynamically selecting an organizing principle that is best suited to the data at each level of the hierarchy by entity, by location, by event, or by date.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We also intend to scale the system to even larger document collections, and explore joint clustering and summarization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Lastly, we plan to research hierarchical summarization in other domains.</a>
