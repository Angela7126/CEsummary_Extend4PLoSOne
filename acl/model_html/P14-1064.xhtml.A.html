<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Statistical phrase-based translation learns translation rules from bilingual corpora, and has traditionally only used monolingual evidence to construct features that rescore existing translation candidates..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this work, we present a semi-supervised graph-based approach for generating new translation rules that leverages bilingual and monolingual data..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The proposed technique first constructs phrase graphs using both source and target language monolingual corpora..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Next, graph propagation identifies translations of phrases that were not observed in the bilingual corpus, assuming that similar phrases have similar translations..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We report results on a large Arabic-English system and a medium-sized Urdu-English system..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of competitive phrase-based systems, leading to consistent improvements between 1 and 4 BLEU points on standard evaluation sets..</a>
