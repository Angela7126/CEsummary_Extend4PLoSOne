<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The disambiguation algorithm presented in this paper is implemented in SemLinker, an entity linking system.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, named entities are linked to candidate Wikipedia pages by a generic annotation engine.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Then, the algorithm re-ranks candidate links according to mutual relations between all the named entities found in the document.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation is based on experiments conducted on the test corpus of the TAC-KBP 2012 entity linking task.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The presented system provides a robust semantic disambiguation method, based on mutual relation of entities inside a document, using a standard annotation engine.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It uses co-reference, NE normalization methods, and Wikipedia internal links as mutual disambiguation resource to improve the annotations.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We show that our proposition improves the performance of a standard annotation engine applied to the TAC-KBP evaluation framework.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>SemLinker is fully implemented, and publicly released as an open source toolkit ( http://code.google.com/p/semlinker.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It has been deployed in the TAC-KBP 2013 evaluation campaign.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our future work will integrate other annotation engines in the system architecture in a collaborative approach.</a>
