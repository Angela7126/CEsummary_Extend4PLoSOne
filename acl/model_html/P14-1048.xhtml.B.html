<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we presented an efficient text-level discourse parser with time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our approach was to adopt a greedy bottom-up tree-building, with two linear-chain CRFs as local probabilistic models, and enforce reasonable constraints in the first CRF s Viterbi decoding..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> While significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art model by Joty et al..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> 2013 ) , our parser is much faster in practice..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In addition, we propose a novel idea of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built discourse tree by considering information from upper-level constituents..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We show that, although doubling the time consumption, post-editing can further boost the parsing performance to close to 90% of human performance..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In future work, we wish to further explore the idea of post-editing, since currently we use only the depth of the subtrees as upper-level information..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Moreover, we wish to study whether we can incorporate constraints into the relation models, as we do to the structure models..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> For example, it might be helpful to train the relation models using additional criteria, such as Generalized Expectation [ 11 ] , to better take into account some prior knowledge about the relations..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Last but not least, as reflected by the low MAFS in our experiments, some particularly difficult relation types might need specifically designed features for better recognition..</a>
