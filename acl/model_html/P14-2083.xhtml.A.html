<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In linguistic annotation projects, we typically develop annotation guidelines to minimize disagreement..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, in this position paper we question whether we should actually limit the disagreements between annotators, rather than embracing them..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We present an empirical analysis of part-of-speech annotated data sets that suggests that disagreements are systematic across domains and to a certain extend also across languages..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> This points to an underlying ambiguity rather than random errors..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Moreover, a quantitative analysis of tag confusions reveals that the majority of disagreements are due to linguistically debatable cases rather than annotation errors..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Specifically, we show that even in the absence of annotation guidelines only 2%Â of annotator choices are linguistically unmotivated..</a>
