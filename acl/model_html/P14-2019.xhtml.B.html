<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Parallel treebank construction efforts increased significantly in the recent years..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Many parallel treebanks are produced to build statistically strong language models for different languages..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this study, we report our preliminary efforts to build such a parallel corpus for Turkish-English pair..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We translated and transformed a subset of parse trees of Penn Treebank to Turkish..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We cover more than 50% of all sentences with a maximum length of 15-words including punctuation..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> This work constitutes the preliminary step of parallel treebank generation..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> As a next step, we will focus on morphological analysis and disambiguation of Turkish words..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> After determining the correct morphological analysis of Turkish words, we will use the parts of these analyses to replace the leaf nodes that we intentionally left as *NONE* ..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> As a future work, we plan to expand the dataset to include all Penn Treebank sentences..</a>
