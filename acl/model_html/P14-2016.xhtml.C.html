<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper presents an approach to query construction to detect multilingual dictionaries for predetermined language combinations on the web, based on the identification of terms which are likely to occur in bilingual dictionaries but not in general web documents.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We use eight target languages for our case study, and train our method on pre-identified multilingual dictionaries and the Wikipedia dump for each of our languages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We have described initial results for a method designed to automatically detect multilingual dictionaries on the web, and attained highly credible results over both a synthetic dataset and an experiment over the open web using a web search engine.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In future work, we hope to explore the ability of the method to detect domain-specific dictionaries (e.g., training over domain-specific dictionaries from other language pairs), and low-density languages where there are few dictionaries and Wikipedia articles to train the method on.</a>
