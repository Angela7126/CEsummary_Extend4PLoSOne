<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper proposes a novel method for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings, which are trained using a large-scale corpus..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Using the word embeddings, we learn the hypernym hyponym relationship by estimating projection matrices which map words to their hypernyms..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Further improvements are made using a cluster-based approach in order to model the more fine-grained relations..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Then we propose a few simple criteria to identity whether a new word pair is a hypernym hyponym relation..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Based on the pairwise hypernym hyponym relations, we build semantic hierarchies automatically..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In our experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best F1-score of 73.74% on a manually labeled test dataset..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Further experiments show that our method is complementary to the previous manually-built hierarchy extension methods..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> For future work, we aim to improve word embedding learning under the guidance of hypernym hyponym relations..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> By including the hypernym hyponym relation constraints while training word embeddings, we expect to improve the embeddings such that they become more suitable for this task..</a>
