<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Finite-state chunking and tagging methods are very fast for annotating non-hierarchical syntactic information, and are often applied in applications that do not require full syntactic analyses.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Scenarios such as incremental machine translation may benefit from some degree of hierarchical syntactic analysis without requiring fully connected parses.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We introduce hedge parsing as an approach to recovering constituents of length up to some maximum span L.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This approach improves efficiency by bounding constituent size, and allows for efficient segmentation strategies prior to parsing.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unlike shallow parsing methods, hedge parsing yields internal hierarchical structure of phrases within its span bound.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We present the approach and some initial experiments on different inference strategies.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We proposed a novel partial parsing approach for applications that require a fast syntactic analysis of the input beyond shallow bracketing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The span-limit parameter allows tuning the annotation of internal structure as appropriate for the application domain, trading off annotation complexity against inference time.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These properties make hedge parsing potentially very useful for incremental text or speech processing, such as streaming text analysis or simultaneous translation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>One interesting characteristic of these annotations is that they allow for string segmentation prior to inference, provided that the segment boundaries do not cross any hedge boundaries.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We found that baseline segmentation models did provide a significant speedup in parsing, but that cascading errors remain a problem.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>There are many directions of future work to pursue here.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>First, the current results are all for exhaustive CYK parsing, and we plan to perform a detailed investigation of the performance of hedgebank parsing with prioritization and pruning methods of the sort available in BUBS [ 2 ].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Further, this sort of annotation seems well suited to incremental parsing with beam search, which has been shown to achieve high accuracies even for fully connected parsing [ 14 ].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Improvements to the transform (e.g.,, grouping items not in hedges under non-terminals) and to the segmentation model (e.g.,, increasing precision at the expense of recall) could improve accuracy without greatly reducing efficiency.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Finally, we intend to perform an extrinsic evaluation of this parsing in an on-line task such as simultaneous translation.</a>
