<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We presented DepecheMood , an emotion lexicon built in a novel and totally automated way by harvesting crowd-sourced affective annotation from a social news network..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our experimental results indicate high-coverage and high-precision of the lexicon, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches even when using the resource with very na√Øve classification and regression strategies..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We believe that the wealth of information provided by social media can be harnessed to build models and resources for emotion recognition from text, going a step beyond sentiment analysis..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our future work will include testing Singular Value Decomposition on the word-by-document matrices, allowing to propagate emotions values for a document to similar words non present in the document itself, and the study of perceived mood effects on virality indices and readers engagement by exploiting tweets, likes, reshares and comments..</a>
