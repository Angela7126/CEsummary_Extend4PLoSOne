<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In statistical machine translation (SMT), syntax-based pre-ordering of the source language is an effective method for dealing with language pairs where there are great differences in their respective word orders.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper introduces a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for Chinese-English SMT.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We present a set of dependency-based pre-ordering rules which improved the BLEU score by 1.61 on the NIST 2006 evaluation data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We also investigate the accuracy of the rule set by conducting human evaluations.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we introduced a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for a Chinese-English PBSMT system.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The results showed that our approach achieved a BLEU score gain of 1.61.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Moreover, our dependency-based pre-ordering rule set substantially decreased the time for applying pre-ordering rules about 60% compared with WR07, on the training set of 1M sentences pairs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The overall accuracy of our rule set is 60.0%, which is almost at the same level as the WR07 rule set.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These results indicated that dependency parsing is more effective for conducting pre-ordering for Chinese-English PBSMT.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Although our work focused on Chinese, the ideas can also be applied to other languages.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the future, we attempt to create more efficient pre-ordering rules by exploiting the rich information in dependency structures.</a>
