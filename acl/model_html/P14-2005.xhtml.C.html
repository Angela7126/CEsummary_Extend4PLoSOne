<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper extends the original BLANC ( BLANC-gold henceforth) to system mentions, removing the gold mention assumption.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The proposed BLANC falls back seamlessly to the original one if system mentions are identical to gold mentions, and it is shown to strongly correlate with existing metrics on the 2011 and 2012 CoNLL data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The original BLANC-gold [ 7 ] requires that system mentions be identical to gold mentions, which limits the metric s utility since detected system mentions often have missing key mentions or spurious mentions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The proposed BLANC is free from this assumption, and we have shown that it subsumes the original BLANC-gold.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since BLANC works on imperfect system mentions, we have used it to score the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 coreference systems.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The BLANC scores show strong correlation with existing metrics, especially B-cubed and CEAF-m.</a>
