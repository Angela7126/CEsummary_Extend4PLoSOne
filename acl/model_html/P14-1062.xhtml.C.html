<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The ability to accurately represent sentences is central to language understanding.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The network uses Dynamic k -Max Pooling, a global pooling operation over linear sequences.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We test the DCNN in four experiments small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25 % error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have described a dynamic convolutional neural network that uses the dynamic k -max pooling operator as a non-linear subsampling function.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The feature graph induced by the network is able to capture word relations of varying size.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The network achieves high performance on question and sentiment classification without requiring external features as provided by parsers or other resources.</a>
