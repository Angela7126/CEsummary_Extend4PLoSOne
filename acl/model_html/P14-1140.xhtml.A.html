<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a novel recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN) to model the end-to-end decoding process for statistical machine translation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> R 2 NN is a combination of recursive neural network and recurrent neural network, and in turn integrates their respective capabilities..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> 1) new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, so that language model and translation model can be integrated naturally; (2) a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks, so as to generate the translation candidates in a bottom up manner..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> A semi-supervised training approach is proposed to train the parameters, and the phrase pair embedding is explored to model translation confidence directly..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiments on a Chinese to English translation task show that our proposed R 2 NN can outperform the state-of-the-art baseline by about 1.5 points in BLEU..</a>
