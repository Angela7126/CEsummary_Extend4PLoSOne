<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recently, neural network models for natural language processing tasks have been increasingly focused on for their ability to alleviate the burden of manual feature engineering..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model for Chinese word segmentation called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> By exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation, MMTNN has the ability to model complicated interactions between tags and context characters..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Furthermore, a new tensor factorization approach is proposed to speed up the model and avoid overfitting..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiments on the benchmark dataset show that our model achieves better performances than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature engineering..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Despite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, MMTNN can be easily generalized and applied to other sequence labeling tasks..</a>
