<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Semantic hierarchy construction aims to build structures of concepts linked by hypernym hyponym ( is-a ) relations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A major challenge for this task is the automatic discovery of such relations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper proposes a novel and effective method for the construction of semantic hierarchies based on word embeddings, which can be used to measure the semantic relationship between words.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a manually labeled test dataset.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve F-score to 80.29%.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This paper proposes a novel method for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings, which are trained using a large-scale corpus.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using the word embeddings, we learn the hypernym hyponym relationship by estimating projection matrices which map words to their hypernyms.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Further improvements are made using a cluster-based approach in order to model the more fine-grained relations.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Then we propose a few simple criteria to identity whether a new word pair is a hypernym hyponym relation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Based on the pairwise hypernym hyponym relations, we build semantic hierarchies automatically.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In our experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves the best F1-score of 73.74% on a manually labeled test dataset.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Further experiments show that our method is complementary to the previous manually-built hierarchy extension methods.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>For future work, we aim to improve word embedding learning under the guidance of hypernym hyponym relations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>By including the hypernym hyponym relation constraints while training word embeddings, we expect to improve the embeddings such that they become more suitable for this task.</a>
