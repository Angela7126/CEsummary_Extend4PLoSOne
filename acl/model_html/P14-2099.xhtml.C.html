<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To support empirical study of online privacy policies, as well as tools for users with privacy concerns, we consider the problem of aligning sections of a thousand policy documents, based on the issues they address.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We apply an unsupervised HMM; in two new (and reusable) evaluations, we find the approach more effective than clustering and topic models.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We considered the task of aligning sections of a collection of roughly similarly-structured legal documents, based on the issues they address.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We introduced an unsupervised model for this task along with two new (and reusable) evaluations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our experiments show the approach to be more effective than clustering and topic models.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The corpus and evaluation data have been made available at http://usableprivacy.org/data.</a>
