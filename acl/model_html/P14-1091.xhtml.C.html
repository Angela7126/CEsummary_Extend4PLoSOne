<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A typical knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) system faces two challenges one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning representations (MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases (KBs) using generated MRs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Unlike previous methods which treat them in a cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two tasks in one unified framework.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our method achieves better results.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This paper presents a translation-based KB-QA method that integrates semantic parsing and QA in one unified framework.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Comparing to the baseline system using an independent semantic parser with state-of-the-art performance, we achieve better results on a general domain evaluation set.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Several directions can be further explored in the future i) We plan to design a method that can extract question patterns automatically, using existing labeled question patterns and KB as weak supervision.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As we discussed in the experiment part, how to mine high-quality question patterns is worth further study for the QA task; (ii) We plan to integrate an ad-hoc NER into our KB-QA system to alleviate the entity detection issue; (iii) In fact, our proposed QA framework can be generalized to other intelligence besides knowledge bases as well.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Any method that can generate answers to questions, such as the Web-based QA approach, can be integrated into this framework, by using them in the question translation component.</a>
