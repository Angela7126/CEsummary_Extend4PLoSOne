<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Incorrect normalization of text can be particularly damaging for applications like text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) or typing auto-correction, where the resulting normalization is directly presented to the user, versus feeding downstream applications..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In this paper, we focus on abbreviation expansion for TTS, which requires a do no harm , high precision approach yielding few expansion errors at the cost of leaving relatively many abbreviations unexpanded..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In the context of a large-scale, real-world TTS scenario, we present methods for training classifiers to establish whether a particular expansion is apt..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We achieve a large increase in correct abbreviation expansion when combined with the baseline text normalization component of the TTS system, together with a substantial reduction in incorrect expansions..</a>
