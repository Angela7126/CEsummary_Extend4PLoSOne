<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recent work classifying citations in scientific literature has shown that it is possible to improve classification results with extensive feature engineering..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> While this result confirms that citation classification is feasible, there are two drawbacks to this approach i) it requires a large annotated corpus for supervised classification, which in the case of scientific literature is quite expensive; and (ii) feature engineering that is too specific to one area of scientific literature may not be portable to other domains, even within scientific literature..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper we address these two drawbacks..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> First, we frame citation classification as a domain adaptation task and leverage the abundant labeled data available in other domains..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Then, to avoid over-engineering specific citation features for a particular scientific domain, we explore a deep learning neural network approach that has shown to generalize well across domains using unigram and bigram features..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We achieve better citation classification results with this cross-domain approach than using in-domain classification..</a>
