<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural network, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improvement in tagging the web domain text..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In addition, we found that keeping the learned representations unchanged yields better performance compared with further optimizing them on the source domain data..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We release our tools at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> For future work, we would like to investigate the two-phase approach to more challenging tasks, such as web domain syntactic parsing..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> We believe that high-accuracy web domain taggers and parsers would benefit a wide range of downstream tasks such as machine translation..</a>
