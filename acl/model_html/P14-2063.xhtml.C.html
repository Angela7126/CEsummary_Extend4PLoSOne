<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Sentiment analysis in a multilingual world remains a challenging problem, because developing language-specific sentiment lexicons is an extremely resource-intensive process.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We demonstrate the performance of our lexicons in an extrinsic analysis of 2,000 distinct historical figures Wikipedia articles on 30 languages.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Despite cultural difference and the intended neutrality of Wikipedia articles, our lexicons show an average sentiment correlation of 0.28 across all language pairs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our knowledge graph propagation is generally effective at producing useful sentiment lexicons.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Interestingly, the ratio of positive sentiment words is strongly connected with number of sentiment words it is noteworthy that English has the smallest ratio of positive lexicon terms.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The phenomenon possibly shows that many negative words reflecting cultural nuances do not translate wel.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We believe that this ratio can be considered as quality measurement of the propagation.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Similar approaches can be extended to other NLP tasks using different semantic links, specific dictionary and special seed words.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Future work will revolve around learning modifiers, negation terms, and various entity/sentiment attribution.</a>
