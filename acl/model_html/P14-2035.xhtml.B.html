<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper adds to existing evidence from previous research that the introduction of an explicit disambiguation step before the composition improves the quality of the produced composed representations..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The use of a robust regression model rejects the hypothesis that the proposed methodology is helpful only for relatively weak compositional approaches..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> As for future work, an interesting direction would be to see how a prior disambiguation step can affect deep learning compositional settings similar to [] and []..</a>
