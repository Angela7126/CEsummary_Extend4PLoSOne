<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When translating into a segmented language, an extra step is required to desegment the output; previous studies have desegmented the 1-best output from the decoder.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we expand our translation options by desegmenting n -best lists or lattices.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our novel lattice desegmentation algorithm effectively combines both segmented and desegmented views of the target language for a large subspace of possible translation outputs, which allows for inclusion of features related to the desegmentation process, as well as an unsegmented language model (LM.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We investigate this technique in the context of English-to-Arabic and English-to-Finnish translation, showing significant improvements in translation quality over desegmentation of 1-best decoder outputs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have explored deeper integration of morphological desegmentation into the statistical machine translation pipeline.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have presented a novel, finite-state-inspired approach to lattice desegmentation, which allows the system to account for a desegmented view of many possible translations, without any modification to the decoder or any restrictions on phrase extraction.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When applied to English-to-Arabic translation, lattice desegmentation results in a 1.0 BLEU point improvement over one-best desegmentation, and a 1.7 BLEU point improvement over unsegmented translation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We have also applied our approach to English-to-Finnish translation, and although segmentation in general does not currently help, we are able to show significant improvements over a 1-best desegmentation baseline.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In the future, we plan to explore introducing multiple segmentation options into the lattice, and the application of our method to a full morphological analysis (as opposed to segmentation) of the target language.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Eventually, we would like to replace the functionality of factored translation models [ 18 ] with lattice transformation and augmentation.</a>
