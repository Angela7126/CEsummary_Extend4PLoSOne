<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a novel abstractive query-based summarization system for conversations, where queries are defined as phrases reflecting a user information needs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation based on the overall content and the phrasal query information.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We cluster the selected sentences based on their lexical similarity and aggregate the sentences in each cluster by means of a word graph model.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose a ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting, chat and email conversations show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our phrasal query abstraction framework generates a grammatical abstract from a conversation following three steps, as shown in Figure 1.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this phase, our goal is to generate understandable informative abstract sentences that capture the content of the source sentences and represents the information needs defined by queries.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There are several ways of generating abstract sentences (e.g., [ 2 , 18 , 8 , 23 ] ); however, most of them rely heavily on the sentence structure.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We believe that such approaches are suboptimal, especially in dealing with conversational data, because multiparty written conversations are often poorly structured.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Instead, we apply an approach that does not rely on syntax, nor on a standard NLG architecture.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Moreover, since dealing with user queries efficiency is an important aspect, we aim for an approach that is also motivated by the speed with which the abstracts are obtained.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We perform the task of abstract generation in three steps, as follows.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We have presented an unsupervised framework for abstractive summarization of spoken and written conversations based on phrasal queries.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>For content selection, we propose a sentence extraction model that incorporates query relevance and content importance into the extraction process.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For the generation phase, we propose a ranking strategy which selects the best path in the constructed word graph based on fluency, query relevance and content.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Both automatic and manual evaluation of our model show substantial improvement over extraction-based methods, including Biased LexRank, which is considered a state-of-the-art system.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Moreover, our system also yields good grammaticality score for human evaluation and achieves comparable scores with the original sentences.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Our future work is four-fold.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>First, we are trying to improve our model by incorporating conversational features (e.g.,, speech acts.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Second, we aim at implementing a strategy to order the clusters for generating more coherent abstracts.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Third, we try to improve our generated summary by resolving coreferences and incorporating speaker information (e.g.,, names) in the clustering and sentence generation phases.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Finally, we plan to take advantage of topic shifts to better segment the relevant parts of conversations in relation to phrasal queries.</a>
