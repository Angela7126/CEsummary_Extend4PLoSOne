<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A typical knowledge-based question answering (KB-QA) system faces two challenges one is to transform natural language questions into their meaning representations (MRs); the other is to retrieve answers from knowledge bases (KBs) using generated MRs..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Unlike previous methods which treat them in a cascaded manner, we present a translation-based approach to solve these two tasks in one unified framework..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We translate questions to answers based on CYK parsing..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Answers as translations of the span covered by each CYK cell are obtained by a question translation method, which first generates formal triple queries as MRs for the span based on question patterns and relation expressions, and then retrieves answers from a given KB based on triple queries generated..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> A linear model is defined over derivations, and minimum error rate training is used to tune feature weights based on a set of question-answer pairs..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Compared to a KB-QA system using a state-of-the-art semantic parser, our method achieves better results..</a>
