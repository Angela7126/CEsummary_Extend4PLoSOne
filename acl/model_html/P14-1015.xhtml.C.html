<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Discussion forums have evolved into a dependable source of knowledge to solve common problems.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, only a minority of the posts in discussion forums are solution posts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Identifying solution posts from discussion forums, hence, is an important research problem.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we present a technique for unsupervised solution post identification leveraging a so far unexplored textual feature, that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use translation models and language models to exploit lexical correlations and solution post character respectively.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our technique is designed to not rely much on structural features such as post metadata since such features are often not uniformly available across forums.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our clustering-based iterative solution identification approach based on the EM-formulation performs favorably in an empirical evaluation, beating the only unsupervised solution identification technique from literature by a very large margin.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We also show that our unsupervised technique is competitive against methods that require supervision, outperforming one such technique comfortably.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We considered the problem of unsupervised solution post identification from discussion forum threads.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Towards identifying solutions to the problem posed in the initial post, we proposed the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature for the solution identification problem; that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We model and harness lexical correlations using translation models, in the company of unigram language models that are used to characterize reply posts, and formulate a clustering-based EM approach for solution identification.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We show that our technique is able to effectively identify solutions using just one non-content based feature, the post position, whereas previous techniques in literature have depended heavily on structural features (that are not always available in many forums) and supervised information.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Our technique is seen to outperform the sole unsupervised solution identification technique in literature, by a large margin; further, our method is even seen to be competitive to recent methods that use supervision, beating one of them comfortably, and trailing another by a narrow margin.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In short, our empirical analysis illustrates the superior performance and establishes our method as the method of choice for unsupervised solution identification.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Exploration into the usage of translation models to aid other operations in discussion forums such as proactive word suggestions for solution authoring would be interesting direction for follow-up work.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Discovery of problem-solution pairs in cases where the problem post is not known beforehand, would be a challenging problem to address.</a>
