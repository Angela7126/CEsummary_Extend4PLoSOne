<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we proposed a method for automatic detection of cognates based on orthographic alignment..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We employed the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [ 29 ] for sequence alignment widely-used in computational biology and we used aligned pairs of words to extract rules for lexical changes occurring when words enter new languages..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We applied our method on an automatically extracted dataset of cognates for four pairs of languages..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> As future work, we plan to extend our method on a few levels..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In this paper we used a very simple substitution matrix for the alignment algorithm, but the method can be adapted to integrate historical information regarding language evolution..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The substitution matrix for the alignment algorithm can be customized with language-specific information, in order to reflect the probability of a character to change into another..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> An important achievement in this direction belongs to Delmestri and Cristianini ( 2010 ) , who introduced PAM-like matrices, linguistic-inspired substitution matrices which are based on information regarding orthographic changes..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We plan to investigate the contribution of using this type of substitution matrices for our method..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> We intend to investigate other approaches to string alignment, such as local alignment [ 33 ] , and other learning algorithms for discriminating between cognates and non-cognates..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> We plan to extend our analysis with more language-specific features, where linguistic knowledge is available..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> First, we intend to use the part of speech as an additional feature..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> We assume that some orthographic changes are dependent on the part of speech of the words..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Secondly, we want to investigate whether accounting for the common ancestor language influences the results..</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14> We are interested to find out if the orthographic rules depend on the source language, or if they are rather specific to the target language..</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15> Finally, we plan to make a performance comparison on cognate pairs versus word-etymon pairs and to investigate false friends [ 27 ]..</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16> We further intend to adapt our method for cognate detection to a closely related task, namely cognate production, i.e.,, given an input word w , a related language L and a set of learned rules for orthographic changes, to produce the cognate pair of w in L..</a>
