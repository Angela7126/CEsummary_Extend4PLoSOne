<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> However, in the process of establishing an empirical baseline we discovered that rejuvenation does not play a significant role in the experiments of Canini et al..</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Moreover, we found that performance of the particle filter was strongly affected by the random initialization of the model, and suggested a simple approach to reduce the variability therein without using additional data..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In conclusion, it is now an open question whether and if so, under what assumptions rejuvenation benefits particle filters for LDA and similar static Bayesian models..</a>
