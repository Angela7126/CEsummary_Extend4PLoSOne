<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We recorded confidence judgements and requests for contextualizing information for each comment during annotation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We analyzed this corpus to provide empirical evidence that annotators quite often require context beyond the comment under consideration to discern irony; especially for those comments ultimately deemed as being intended ironically..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We demonstrated that a standard token-based machine learning approach misclassified many of the same comments for which annotators tend to request context..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We have shown that annotators rely on contextual cues (in addition to word and grammatical features) to discern irony and argued that this implies computers should, too..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> The obvious next step is to develop new machine learning models that exploit the contextual information available in the corpus we have curated (e.g.,, previous comments by the same user, the thread topic..</a>
