<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a novel model for enriching the content of microblogs by exploiting external knowledge, thus improving the data sparseness problem in short text classification..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We assume that microblogs share the same topics with external knowledge..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We first build an optimization model to infer the topics of microblogs by employing the topic-word distribution of the external knowledge..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Then the content of microblogs is further enriched by relevant words from external knowledge..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Experiments on microblog classification show that our approach is effective and outperforms traditional text classification methods..</a>
