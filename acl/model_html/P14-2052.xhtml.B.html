<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed a method of summarizing a single document that included relations between sentences and relations between words..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We built a nested tree and formulated the problem of summarization as that of integer linear programming..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our method significantly improved the ROUGE score with significantly fewer sentences than the method of EDU selection..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The results suggest that our method relaxed the fragmentation of information..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We also discussed the effectiveness of sentence subtree selection that did not restrict rooted subtrees..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Although ROUGE scores are widely used as evaluation metrics for text summarization systems, they cannot take into consideration linguistic qualities such as human readability..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Hence, we plan to conduct evaluations with people 7 7 For example, the quality question metric from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We only used the rhetorical structures between sentences in this study..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> However, there were also rhetorical structures between EDUs inside individual sentences..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Hence, utilizing these for sentence compression has been left for future work..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> In addition, we used rhetorical structures that were manually annotated..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> There have been related studies on building RST parsers [ 7 , 1 ] and by using such parsers, we should be able to apply our model to other corpora or to multi-document settings..</a>
