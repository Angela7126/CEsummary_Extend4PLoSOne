<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We presented a step-wise unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from instances in giga-word corpora..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This method first clusters predicate-argument structures to induce verb-specific semantic frames and then clusters these semantic frames across verbs to induce verb classes..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Both clustering steps are performed with exactly the same method, which is based on the Chinese Restaurant Process..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The resulting semantic frames and verb classes are open to the public and also can be searched via our web interface..</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> From the results, we can see that the combination of the slot-word pair features for clustering verb-specific frames and the slot-only features for clustering across verbs is the most effective and outperforms the baselines by approximately 10 points..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> This indicates that slot distributions are more effective than lexical information in slot-word pairs for the induction of verb classes, when Levin-style classes are used for evaluation..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> This is consistent with Levin s principle of organizing verb classes according to the syntactic behavior of verbs..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> As applications of the resulting semantic frames and verb classes, we plan to integrate them into syntactic parsing, semantic role labeling and verb sense disambiguation..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> For instance, Kawahara and Kurohashi ( 2006 ) improved accuracy of dependency parsing based on Japanese semantic frames automatically induced from a raw corpus..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> It is also valuable and promising to apply the induced verb classes to NLP applications as used in metaphor identification [ 34 ] and argumentative zoning [ 8 ]..</a>
