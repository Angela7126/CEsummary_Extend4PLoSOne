<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>GPUs represent a challenging opportunity for natural language processing..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> By carefully designing within the constraints imposed by the architecture, we have created a parser that can exploit the same kinds of sparsity that have been developed for more traditional architectures..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> One of the key remaining challenges going forward is confronting the kind of lexicalized sparsity common in other NLP models..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The Berkeley parser s grammars by virtue of being unlexicalized can be applied uniformly to all parse items..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The bilexical features needed by dependency models and lexicalized constituency models are not directly amenable to acceleration using the techniques we described here..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Determining how to efficiently implement these kinds of models is a promising area for new research..</a>
