<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed a method to predict the distribution of a word across domains..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We first create a distributional representation for a word using the data from a single domain, and then learn a Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) model to predict the distribution of a word in a target domain given its distribution in a source domain..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We evaluated the proposed method in two domain adaptation tasks cross-domain POS tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our experiments show that without requiring any task-specific customisations to our distribution prediction method, it outperforms competitive baselines and achieves comparable results to the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods..</a>
