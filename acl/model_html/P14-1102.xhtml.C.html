<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Analyses of filler-gap dependencies usually involve complex syntactic rules or heuristics; however recent results suggest that filler-gap comprehension begins earlier than seemingly simpler constructions such as ditransitives or passives.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, this work models filler-gap acquisition as a byproduct of learning word orderings (e.g., SVO vs OSV), which must be done at a very young age anyway in order to extract meaning from language.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Specifically, this model, trained on part-of-speech tags, represents the preferred locations of semantic roles relative to a verb as Gaussian mixtures over real numbers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This approach learns role assignment in filler-gap constructions in a manner consistent with current developmental findings and is extremely robust to initialization variance.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Additionally, this model is shown to be able to account for a characteristic error made by learners during this period ( A and B gorped interpreted as A gorped B.</a>
