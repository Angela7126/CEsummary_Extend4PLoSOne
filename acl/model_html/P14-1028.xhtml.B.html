<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Moreover, we propose a tensor factorization approach that effectively improves the model efficiency and avoids the risk of overfitting..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our model achieve better results than previous neural network models and that our model can achieve a competitive result with minimal feature engineering..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In the future, we plan to further extend our model and apply it to other structure prediction problems..</a>
