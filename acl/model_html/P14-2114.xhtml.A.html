<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With the proliferation of social media sites, social streams have proven to contain the most up-to-date information on current events..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Therefore, it is crucial to extract events from the social streams such as tweets..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> However, it is not straightforward to adapt the existing event extraction systems since texts in social media are fragmented and noisy..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper we propose a simple and yet effective Bayesian model, called Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract structured representation of events from social media..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> LEM is fully unsupervised and does not require annotated data for training..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We evaluate LEM on a Twitter corpus..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 83% in F-measure, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline by over 7%..</a>
