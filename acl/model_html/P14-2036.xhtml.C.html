<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, we propose a novel model for enriching the content of microblogs by exploiting external knowledge, thus improving the data sparseness problem in short text classification.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We assume that microblogs share the same topics with external knowledge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We first build an optimization model to infer the topics of microblogs by employing the topic-word distribution of the external knowledge.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Then the content of microblogs is further enriched by relevant words from external knowledge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiments on microblog classification show that our approach is effective and outperforms traditional text classification methods.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We propose an effective content enriching method for microblog, to enhance classification accuracy.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>News corpus is exploited as external knowledge.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As for techniques, our method uses LDA as its topic analysis model and formulates topic inference for new data as convex optimization problems.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Compared with traditional representation, enriched microblog shows great improvement in classification tasks.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As we do not control the quality of added words, our future work starts from building a filter to select better additional information.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>And to make the most of external knowledge, better ways to build topic space should be considered.</a>
