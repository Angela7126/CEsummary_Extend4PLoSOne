<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An important search task in the biomedical domain is to find medical records of patients who are qualified for a clinical trial..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> One commonly used approach is to apply NLP tools to map terms from queries and documents to concepts and then compute the relevance scores based on the concept-based representation..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> However, the mapping results are not perfect, and none of previous work studied how to deal with them in the retrieval process..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper, we focus on addressing the limitations caused by the imperfect mapping results and study how to further improve the retrieval performance of the concept-based ranking methods..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In particular, we apply axiomatic approaches and propose two weighting regularization methods that adjust the weighting based on the relations among the concepts..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Experimental results show that the proposed methods are effective to improve the retrieval performance, and their performances are comparable to other top-performing systems in the TREC Medical Records Track..</a>
