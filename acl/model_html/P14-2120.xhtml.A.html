<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We investigate recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not explicitly expressed in syntactic structure..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> While prior works addressed such relationships as an extension to semantic role labeling, our work investigates them in the context of textual inference scenarios..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Such scenarios provide prior information, which substantially eases the task..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We provide a large and freely available evaluation dataset for our task setting, and propose methods to cope with it, while obtaining promising results in empirical evaluations..</a>
