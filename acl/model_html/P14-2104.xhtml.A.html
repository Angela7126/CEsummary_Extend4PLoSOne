<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we introduce a semantic role labeler for Korean, an agglutinative language with rich morphology..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> First, we create a novel training source by semantically annotating a Korean corpus containing fine-grained morphological and syntactic information..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We then develop a supervised SRL model by leveraging morphological features of Korean that tend to correspond with semantic roles..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our model also employs a variety of latent morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> These elements lead to state-of-the-art performance of 81.07% labeled F1, representing the best SRL performance reported to date for an agglutinative language..</a>
