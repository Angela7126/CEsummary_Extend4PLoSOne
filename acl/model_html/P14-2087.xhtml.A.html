<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We replace the overlap mechanism of the Lesk algorithm with a simple, general-purpose Naive Bayes model that measures many-to-many association between two sets of random variables..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Even with simple probability estimates such as maximum likelihood, the model gains significant improvement over the Lesk algorithm on word sense disambiguation tasks..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> With additional lexical knowledge from WordNet, performance is further improved to surpass the state-of-the-art results..</a>
