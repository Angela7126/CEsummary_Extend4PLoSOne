<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are two dominant approaches to Chinese word segmentation word-based and character-based models, each with respective strengths.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Prior work has shown that gains in segmentation performance can be achieved from combining these two types of models; however, past efforts have not provided a practical technique to allow mainstream adoption.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a method that effectively combines the strength of both segmentation schemes using an efficient dual-decomposition algorithm for joint inference.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our method is simple and easy to implement.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiments on SIGHAN 2003 and 2005 evaluation datasets show that our method achieves the best reported results to date on 6 out of 7 datasets.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper we presented an approach to Chinese word segmentation using dual decomposition for system combination.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We demonstrated that this method allows for joint decoding of existing CWS systems that is more accurate and consistent than either system alone, and further achieves the best performance reported to date on standard datasets for the task.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Perhaps most importantly, our approach is straightforward to implement and does not require retraining of the underlying segmentation models used.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This suggests its potential for broader applicability in real-world settings than existing approaches to combining character-based and word-based models for Chinese word segmentation.</a>
