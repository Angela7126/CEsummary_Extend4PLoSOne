<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We study the problem of generating an English sentence given an underlying probabilistic grammar, a world and a communicative goal..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We model the generation problem as a Markov decision process with a suitably defined reward function that reflects the communicative goal..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We then use probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence that, with high probability, accomplishes the communicative goal..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We show empirically that our approach can generate complex sentences with a speed that generally matches or surpasses the state of the art..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Further, we show that our approach is anytime and can handle complex communicative goals, including negated goals..</a>
