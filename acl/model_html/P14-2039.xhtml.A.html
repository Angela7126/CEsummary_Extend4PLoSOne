<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The primary way of providing real-time speech to text captioning for hard of hearing people is to employ expensive professional stenographers who can type as fast as natural speaking rates..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Recent work has shown that a feasible alternative is to combine the partial captions of ordinary typists, each of whom is able to type only part of what they hear..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we extend the state of the art fixed-window alignment algorithm [] for combining the individual captions into a final output sequence..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our method performs alignment on a sliding window of the input sequences, drastically reducing both the number of errors and the latency of the system to the end user over the previously published approaches..</a>
