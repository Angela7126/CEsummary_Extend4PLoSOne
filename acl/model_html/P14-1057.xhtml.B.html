<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Medical record retrieval is an important domain-specific IR problem..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Concept-based representation is an effective approach to dealing with ambiguity terminology in medical domain..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> However, the results of the NLP tools used to generate the concept-based representation are often not perfect..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper, we present a general methodology that can use axiomatic approaches as guidance to regularize the concept weighting strategies to address the limitations caused by the inaccurate concept mapping and improve the retrieval performance..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In particular, we proposed two weighting regularization methods based on the relations among concepts..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly outperform existing retrieval functions..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> There are many interesting directions for our future work..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> First, we plan to study how to automatically predict whether to use concept-based indexing based on the quality of MetaMap results, and explore whether the proposed methods are applicable for other entity linking methods..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Second, we will study how to leverage other information from knowledge bases to further improve the performance..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Third, more experiments could be conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods when using other ranking strategies..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Finally, it would be interesting to study how to follow the proposed methodology to study other domain-specific IR problems..</a>
