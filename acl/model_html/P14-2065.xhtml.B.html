<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Results of Phase 1 provide support for the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis, at least as a strong bias..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> More work will be needed to determine the strength of that bias..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The findings are largely consistent with VerbNet s semantics, but changes are indicated in some cases..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We find that inter-annotator agreement is sufficiently high that annotation can be done effectively using the modal response with an average of 6-7 responses per item..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We are currently investigating whether we can achieve better reliability with fewer responses per item by taking into account an individual annotator s history across items, as recent work suggests is possible [ 13 , 17 , 19 ]..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Thus, crowd-sourcing VerbNet semantic entailments appears to be both feasible and productive..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Data-collection continues..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Phase 2, which added over 10 new verb classes, is complete..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Phase 3, which includes both new classes and new entailments, has been launched..</a>
