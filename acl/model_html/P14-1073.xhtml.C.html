<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Entity clustering must determine when two named-entity mentions refer to the same entity.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The generative process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally mutating an earlier name from a similar context.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Clustering the mentions into entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models of the mutation process and parent selection process.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We present a block Gibbs sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several datasets.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our primary contribution consists of new modeling ideas, and associated inference techniques, for the problem of cross-document coreference resolution.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have described how writers systematically plunder ( ) and then systematically modify ( ) the work of past writers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Inference under such models could also play a role in tracking evolving memes and social influence, not merely in establishing strict coreference.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our model also provides an alternative to the distance-dependent CRP.</a>
