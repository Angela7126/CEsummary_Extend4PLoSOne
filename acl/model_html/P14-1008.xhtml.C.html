<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) is a framework of natural language semantics with easy-to-process structures as well as strict semantics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we equip the DCS framework with logical inference, by defining abstract denotations as an abstraction of the computing process of denotations in original DCS.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An inference engine is built to achieve inference on abstract denotations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Furthermore, we propose a way to generate on-the-fly knowledge in logical inference, by combining our framework with the idea of tree transformation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiments on FraCaS and PASCAL RTE datasets show promising results.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Abstract denotations are formulas constructed from a minimal set of relational algebra [] operators, which is already able to formulate the database queries defined by DCS trees.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, the semantics of students read books is given by the abstract denotation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>where read , student and book denote sets represented by these words respectively, and w r represents the set w considered as the domain of the semantic role r (e.g., is the set of books considered as objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The operators and represent intersection and Cartesian product respectively, both borrowed from relational algebra.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is not hard to see the abstract denotation denotes the intersection of the reading set (as illustrated by the read table in Table 1 ) with the product of student set and book set, which results in the same denotation as computed by the DCS tree in Figure 1 , i.e., { John reads Ulysses , }.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, the point is that F 1 itself is an algebraic formula that does not depend on any concrete databases.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Formally, we introduce the following constants.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>W a universal set containing all entities.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Content words a content word (e.g., read ) defines a set representing the word (e.g., = { ( x , y r e a d ( x , y ) }.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In addition we introduce following functions.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>the Cartesian product of two sets.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>the intersection of two sets.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>r projection onto domain of semantic role r (e.g., ( ) = { y x ; r e a d ( x , y ) }.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Generally we admit projections onto multiple semantics roles, denoted by R where R is a set of semantic roles.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>r relabeling (e.g., ( ) = .</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>q r the division operator, where q r ( A , B ) is defined as the largest set X which satisfies B r X A.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>2 2 If A and B has the same dimension, q ( A , B ) is either or { * } ( 0 -dimension point set), depending on if A B.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>This is used to formulate universal quantifiers, such as Mary loves every dog and books read by all students .</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>An abstract denotation is then defined as finite applications of functions on either constants or other abstract denotations.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>We have presented a method of deriving abstract denotation from DCS trees, which enables logical inference on DCS, and we developed a textual inference system based on the framework.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Experimental results have shown the power of the representation that allows both strict inference as on FraCaS data and robust reasoning as on RTE data.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Exploration of an appropriate meaning representation for querying and reasoning on knowledge bases has a long history.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Description logic, being less expressive than FOL but featuring more efficient reasoning, is used as a theory base for Semantic Web [].</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Ideas similar to our framework, including the use of sets in a representation that benefits efficient reasoning, are also found in description logic and knowledge representation community [].</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>To our knowledge, however, their applications to logical inference beyond the use for database querying have not been much explored in the context of NLP.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The pursue of a logic more suitable for natural language inference is not new.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>For instance, has implemented a model of natural logic [].</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>While being computationally efficient, various inference patterns are out of the scope of their system.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Much work has been done in mapping natural language into database queries [].</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Among these, the ( -)DCS [] framework defines algorithms that transparently map a labeled tree to a database querying procedure.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Essentially, this is because DCS trees restrict the querying process to a very limited subset of possible operations.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>Our main contribution, the abstract denotation of DCS trees, can thus be considered as an attempt to characterize a fragment of FOL that is suited for both natural language inference and transparent syntax-semantics mapping, through the choice of operations and relations on sets.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>We have demonstrated the utility of logical inference on DCS through the RTE task.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>A wide variety of strategies tackling the RTE task have been investigated [] , including the comparison of surface strings [] , syntactic and semantic structures [] , semantic vectors [] and logical representations [].</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Acquisition of basic knowledge for RTE is also a huge stream of research [].</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>These previous works include various techniques for acquiring and incorporating different kinds of linguistic and world knowledge, and further fight against the knowledge bottleneck problem, e.g., by back-off to shallower representations.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Logic-based RTE systems employ various approaches to bridge knowledge gaps proposes features from a model builder; proposes an abduction process; shows handcrafted rules could drastically improve the performance of a logic-based RTE system.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>As such, our current RTE system is at a proof-of-concept stage, in that many of the above techniques are yet to be implemented.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>Nonetheless, we would like to emphasize that it already shows performance competitive to state-of-the-art systems on one data set (RTE5.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Other directions of our future work include further exploitation of the new semantic representation.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>For example, since abstract denotations are readily suited for data querying, they can be used to verify newly generated assumptions by fact search in a database.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>This may open a way towards a hybrid approach to RTE wherein logical inference is intermingled with large scale database querying.</a>
