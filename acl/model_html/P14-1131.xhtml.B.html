<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have presented CoSimRank , a new similarity measure that can be computed for a single node pair without relying on the similarities in the whole graph..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We gave two different formalizations of CoSimRank i) a derivation from Personalized PageRank and (ii) a matrix representation that can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We also presented extensions of CoSimRank for a number of applications, thus demonstrating the flexibility of CoSimRank as a similarity measure..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We showed that CoSimRank is superior to SimRank in time and space complexity; and we demonstrated that CoSimRank performs better than PPR+cos on two similarity computation tasks..</a>
