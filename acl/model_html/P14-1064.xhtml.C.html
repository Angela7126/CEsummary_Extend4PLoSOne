<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we present a semi-supervised graph-based approach for generating new translation rules that leverages bilingual and monolingual data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The proposed technique first constructs phrase graphs using both source and target language monolingual corpora.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Next, graph propagation identifies translations of phrases that were not observed in the bilingual corpus, assuming that similar phrases have similar translations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We report results on a large Arabic-English system and a medium-sized Urdu-English system.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of competitive phrase-based systems, leading to consistent improvements between 1 and 4 BLEU points on standard evaluation sets.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this work, we presented an approach that can expand a translation model extracted from a sentence-aligned, bilingual corpus using a large amount of unstructured, monolingual data in both source and target languages, which leads to improvements of 1.4 and 1.2 BLEU points over strong baselines on evaluation sets, and in some scenarios gains in excess of 4 BLEU points.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the future, we plan to estimate the graph structure through other learned, distributed representations.</a>
