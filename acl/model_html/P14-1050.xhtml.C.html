<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper aims at extracting new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven framework for this purpose.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We design statistical measures respectively to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and requires no elaborated linguistic rules.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also demonstrate how new sentiment word will benefit sentiment analysis.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In order to extract new sentiment words from large-scale user-generated content, this paper proposes a fully unsupervised, purely data-driven, and almost knowledge-free (except POS tags) framework.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We design statistical measures to quantify the utility of a lexical pattern and to measure the possibility of a word being a new word, respectively.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The method is almost free of linguistic resources (except POS tags), and does not rely on elaborated linguistic rules.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We conduct extensive experiments to reveal the influence of different statistical measures in new word finding.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Comparative experiments show that our proposed method outperforms baselines remarkably.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Experiments also demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment words benefits sentiment classification definitely.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>From linguistic perspectives, our framework is capable to extract adjective new words because the lexical patterns usually modify adjective words.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As future work, we are considering how to extract other types of new sentiment words, such as nounal new words that can express sentiment.</a>
