<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Chinese is an ancient hieroglyphic.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is inattentive to structure.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Both Omni-word feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmentation and parsing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The results show a significant improvement in Chinese relation extraction, outperforming other methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this paper, We proposed a novel Omni-word feature taking advantages of Chinese sub-phrases.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We also introduced the soft constraint method for Chinese relation recognition.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The soft constraint utilizes four constraint conditions to catch the structure information in a relation instance.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Both the Omni-word feature and soft constrain make better use of information a sentence has, and minimize the deficiency caused by Chinese segmentation and parsing.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The size of the employed lexicon determines the dimension of the feature space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The first impression is that more lexicon entries result in more power.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, more lexicon entries also increase the computational complexity and bring in noises.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In our future work, we will study this issue.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The notion of soft constraints can also be extended to include more patterns, rules, regexes or syntactic constraints that have been used for information extraction.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The usability of these strategies is also left for future work.</a>
