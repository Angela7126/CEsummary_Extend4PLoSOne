<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Many methods of text summarization combining sentence selection and sentence compression have recently been proposed..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Although the dependency between words has been used in most of these methods, the dependency between sentences, i.e.,, rhetorical structures, has not been exploited in such joint methods..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We used both dependency between words and dependency between sentences by constructing a nested tree, in which nodes in the document tree representing dependency between sentences were replaced by a sentence tree representing dependency between words..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We formulated a summarization task as a combinatorial optimization problem, in which the nested tree was trimmed without losing important content in the source document..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The results from an empirical evaluation revealed that our method based on the trimming of the nested tree significantly improved the summarization of texts..</a>
