<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we have shown that discourse structure can be used to improve automatic MT evaluation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> First, we defined two simple discourse-aware similarity metrics (lexicalized and un-lexicalized), which use the all-subtree kernel to compute similarity between discourse parse trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Then, after extensive experimentation on WMT12 and WMT11 data, we showed that a variety of existing evaluation metrics can benefit from our discourse-based metrics, both at the segment- and the system-level, especially when the discourse information is incorporated in an informed way (i.e., using supervised tuning..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our results show that discourse-based metrics can improve the state-of-the-art MT metrics, by increasing correlation with human judgments, even when only sentence-level discourse information is used..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Addressing discourse-level phenomena in MT is a relatively new research direction..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Yet, many of the ongoing efforts have been moderately successful according to traditional evaluation metrics..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> There is a consensus in the MT community that more discourse-aware metrics need to be proposed for this area to move forward..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We believe this work is a valuable contribution towards this longer-term goal..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The tuned combined metrics tested in this paper are just an initial proposal, i.e., a simple adjustment of the relative weights for the individual metrics in a linear combination..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> In the future, we plan to work on integrated representations of syntactic, semantic and discourse-based structures, which would allow us to train evaluation metrics based on more fine-grained features..</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11> Additionally, we propose to use the discourse information for MT in two different ways..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12> First, at the sentence-level, we can use discourse information to re-rank alternative MT hypotheses; this could be applied either for MT parameter tuning, or as a post-processing step for the MT output..</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13> Second, we propose to move in the direction of using discourse information beyond the sentence-level..</a>
