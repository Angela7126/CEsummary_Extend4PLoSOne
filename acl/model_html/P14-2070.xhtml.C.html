<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While many lexica annotated with words polarity are available for sentiment analysis, very few tackle the harder task of emotion analysis and are usually quite limited in coverage.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we present a novel approach for extracting in a totally automated way a high-coverage and high-precision lexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated with emotion scores, called DepecheMood.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our approach exploits in an original way crowd-sourced affective annotation implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By providing new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for regression and classification tasks, even using a na ve approach, our experiments show the beneficial impact of harvesting social media data for affective lexicon building.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We presented DepecheMood , an emotion lexicon built in a novel and totally automated way by harvesting crowd-sourced affective annotation from a social news network.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our experimental results indicate high-coverage and high-precision of the lexicon, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches even when using the resource with very na ve classification and regression strategies.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We believe that the wealth of information provided by social media can be harnessed to build models and resources for emotion recognition from text, going a step beyond sentiment analysis.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our future work will include testing Singular Value Decomposition on the word-by-document matrices, allowing to propagate emotions values for a document to similar words non present in the document itself, and the study of perceived mood effects on virality indices and readers engagement by exploiting tweets, likes, reshares and comments.</a>
