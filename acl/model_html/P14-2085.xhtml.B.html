<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have described a new, context-aware approach to automatically predicting aspectual class, including a new set of distributional features..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We have also introduced two new data sets of clauses labeled for aspectual class..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Our experiments show that in any setting where labeled training data is available, improvement over the most frequent class baseline can only be reached by integrating instance-based features, though type-based features (LingInd, Dist) may provide useful priors for some verbs and successfully predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In order to arrive at a globally well-performing system, we envision a multi-stage approach, treating verbs differently according to whether training data is available and whether or not the verb s aspectual class distribution is highly skewed..</a>
