<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper describes an application of distributional semantics to the study of syntactic productivity in diachrony, i.e.,, the property of grammatical constructions to attract new lexical items over time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By providing an empirical measure of semantic similarity between words derived from lexical co-occurrences, distributional semantics not only reliably captures how the verbs in the distribution of a construction are related, but also enables the use of visualization techniques and statistical modeling to analyze the semantic development of a construction over time and identify the semantic determinants of syntactic productivity in naturally occurring data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper reports the first attempt at using a distributional measure of semantic similarity derived from a vector-space model for the study of syntactic productivity in diachrony.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On the basis of a case study of the construction V the hell out of NP from 1930 to 2009, the advantages of this approach were demonstrated.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Not only does distributional semantics provide an empirically-based measure of semantic similarity that appropriately captures semantic distinctions, it also enables the use of methods for which quantification is necessary, such as data visualization and statistical analysis.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using multidimensional scaling and logistic regression, it was shown that the occurrence of new items throughout the history of the construction can be predicted by the density of the semantic space in the neighborhood of these items in prior usage.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In conclusion, this work opens new perspectives for the study of syntactic productivity in line with the growing synergy between computational linguistics and other fields.</a>
