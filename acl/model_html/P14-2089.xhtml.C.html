<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Word embeddings learned on unlabeled data are a popular tool in semantics, but may not capture the desired semantics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a new learning objective that incorporates both a neural language model objective [] and prior knowledge from semantic resources to learn improved lexical semantic embeddings.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We demonstrate that our embeddings improve over those learned solely on raw text in three settings language modeling, measuring semantic similarity, and predicting human judgements.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We have presented a new learning objective for neural language models that incorporates prior knowledge contained in resources to improve learned word embeddings.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We demonstrated that the Relation Constrained Model can lead to better semantic embeddings by incorporating resources like PPDB, leading to better language modeling, semantic similarity metrics, and predicting human semantic judgements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our implementation is based on the word2vec package and we made it available for general use 2 2 https://github.com/Gorov/JointRCM.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We believe that our techniques have implications beyond those considered in this work.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We plan to explore the embeddings suitability for other semantics tasks, including the use of resources with both typed and scored relations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Additionally, we see opportunities for jointly learning embeddings across many tasks with many resources, and plan to extend our model accordingly.</a>
