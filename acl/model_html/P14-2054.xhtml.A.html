<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose two polynomial time inference algorithms to compress sentences under bigram and dependency-factored objectives..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The first algorithm is exact and requires O ( n 6 ) running time..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> It extends Eisner s cubic time parsing algorithm by using virtual dependency arcs to link deleted words..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Two signatures are added to each span, indicating the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The second algorithm is a fast approximation of the first one..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> It relaxes the compression ratio constraint using Lagrangian relaxation, and thereby requires O ( n 4 ) running time..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Experimental results on the popular sentence compression corpus demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach..</a>
