<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we report our preliminary efforts in building an English-Turkish parallel treebank corpus for statistical machine translation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In the corpus, we manually generated parallel trees for about 5,000 sentences from Penn Treebank..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> English sentences in our set have a maximum of 15 tokens, including punctuation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We constrained the translated trees to the reordering of the children and the replacement of the leaf nodes with appropriate glosses..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We also report the tools that we built and used in our tree translation task..</a>
