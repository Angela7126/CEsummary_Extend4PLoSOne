<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e.,, whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We identify two challenging cases of this problem when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A semi-supervised approach using linguistically-motivated features and a novel set of distributional features based on representative verb types allows us to predict classes accurately, even for unseen verbs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Many frequent verbs can be either stative or dynamic in different contexts, which has not been modeled by previous work; we use contextual features to resolve this ambiguity.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, we introduce two new datasets of clauses marked for aspectual class.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We have described a new, context-aware approach to automatically predicting aspectual class, including a new set of distributional features.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have also introduced two new data sets of clauses labeled for aspectual class.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our experiments show that in any setting where labeled training data is available, improvement over the most frequent class baseline can only be reached by integrating instance-based features, though type-based features (LingInd, Dist) may provide useful priors for some verbs and successfully predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In order to arrive at a globally well-performing system, we envision a multi-stage approach, treating verbs differently according to whether training data is available and whether or not the verb s aspectual class distribution is highly skewed.</a>
