<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Chinese is an ancient hieroglyphic..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> It is inattentive to structure..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Therefore, segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In this paper, we propose an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method for Chinese relation extraction..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature, reducing errors caused by word segmentation..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In order to utilize the structure information of a relation instance, we discuss how soft constraint can be used to capture the local dependency..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Both Omni-word feature and soft constraint make a better use of sentence information and minimize the influences caused by Chinese word segmentation and parsing..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We test these methods on the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> The results show a significant improvement in Chinese relation extraction, outperforming other methods in F-score by 10% in 6 relation types and 15% in 18 relation subtypes..</a>
