<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Accurately segmenting a citation string into fields for authors, titles, etc is a challenging task because the output typically obeys various global constraints..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints , where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> On the other hand, for imposing hard constraints , dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We extend dual decomposition to perform prediction subject to soft constraints..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset..</a>
