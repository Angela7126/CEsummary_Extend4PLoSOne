<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) refers to the task of mapping different named entity mentions in running text to their correct interpretations in a specific knowledge base (KB.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper presents a collective disambiguation approach using a graph model.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>All possible NE candidates are represented as nodes in the graph and associations between different candidates are represented by edges between the nodes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Each node has an initial confidence score, e.g., entity popularity.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Page-Rank is used to rank nodes and the final rank is combined with the initial confidence for candidate selection.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Experiments on 27,819 NE textual mentions show the effectiveness of using Page-Rank in conjunction with initial confidence.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>87% accuracy is achieved, outperforming both baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our results show that Page-Rank in conjunction with re-ranking by initial confidence score can be used as an effective approach to collectively disambiguate named entity textual mentions in a document.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our proposed features are very simple and easy to extract, and work well when employed in PR.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In future work we plan to explore enriching the edges between nodes by incorporating semantic relations extracted from an ontology.</a>
