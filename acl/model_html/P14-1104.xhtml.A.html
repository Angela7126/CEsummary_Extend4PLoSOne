<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Many machine learning datasets are noisy with a substantial number of mislabeled instances..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> This noise yields sub-optimal classification performance..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper we study a large, low quality annotated dataset, created quickly and cheaply using Amazon Mechanical Turk to crowdsource annotations..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We describe computationally cheap feature weighting techniques and a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm that can be used to iteratively and interactively correcting mislabeled instances to significantly improve annotation quality at low cost..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Eight different emotion extraction experiments on Twitter data demonstrate that our approach is just as effective as more computationally expensive techniques..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our techniques save a considerable amount of time..</a>
