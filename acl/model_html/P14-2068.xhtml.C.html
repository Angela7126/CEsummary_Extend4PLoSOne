<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>How do journalists mark quoted content as certain or uncertain, and how do readers interpret these signals.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Predicates such as thinks , claims , and admits offer a range of options for framing quoted content according to the author s own perceptions of its credibility.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We gather a new dataset of direct and indirect quotes from Twitter, and obtain annotations of the perceived certainty of the quoted statements.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We then compare the ability of linguistic and extra-linguistic features to predict readers assessment of the certainty of quoted content.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We see that readers are indeed influenced by such framing devices and we find no evidence that they consider other factors, such as the source, journalist, or the content itself.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In addition, we examine the impact of specific framing devices on perceptions of credibility.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Perceptions of the factuality of quoted content are influenced by the cue words used to introduce them, while extra-linguistic factors, such as the source and the author, did not appear to be relevant in our experiments.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This result is obtained from real tweets written by journalists; a natural counterpart study would be to experimentally manipulate this framing to see if the same perceptions apply.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Another future direction would be to test whether the deployment of cue words as framing devices reflects the ideology of the journalist.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We are also interested to group multiple instances of the same quote [ 7 ] , and examine how its framing varies across different news outlets and over time.</a>
