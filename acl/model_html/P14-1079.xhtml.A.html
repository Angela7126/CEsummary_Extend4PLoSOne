<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The essence of distantly supervised relation extraction is that it is an incomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is low..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods..</a>
