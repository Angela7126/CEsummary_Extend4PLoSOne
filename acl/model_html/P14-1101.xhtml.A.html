<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Learning phonetic categories is one of the first steps to learning a language, yet is hard to do using only distributional phonetic information..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Semantics could potentially be useful, since words with different meanings have distinct phonetics, but it is unclear how many word meanings are known to infants learning phonetic categories..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We show that attending to a weaker source of semantics, in the form of a distribution over topics in the current context, can lead to improvements in phonetic category learning..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In our model, an extension of a previous model of joint word-form and phonetic category inference, the probability of word-forms is topic-dependent, enabling the model to find significantly better phonetic vowel categories and word-forms than a model with no semantic knowledge..</a>
