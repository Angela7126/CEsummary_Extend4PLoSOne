<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Negation words, such as no and not , play a fundamental role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We will refer to a negation word as the negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Commonly used heuristics to estimate the sentiment of negated expressions rely simply on the sentiment of argument (and not on the negator or the argument itself.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics are poor estimators of sentiment.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then modify these heuristics to be dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Next, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model [] that relies on both the negator and the argument.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator s argument with a recursive neural network.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We show that this approach performs better than those mentioned above.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In addition, we explicitly incorporate the prior sentiment of the argument and observe that this information can help reduce fitting errors.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Negation plays a fundamental role in modifying sentiment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the process of semantic composition, the impact of negators is complicated by the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This paper provides a comprehensive and quantitative study of the behavior of negators through a unified view of fitting human annotation.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We first measure the modeling capabilities of two influential heuristics on a sentiment treebank and find that they capture some effect of negation; however, extending these non-lexicalized models to be dependent on the negators improves the performance statistically significantly.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The detailed analysis reveals the differences in the behavior among negators, and we argue that they should always be modeled separately.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>We further make the models to be dependent on the text being modified by negators, through adaptation of a state-of-the-art recursive neural network to incorporate the syntax and semantics of the arguments; we discover this further reduces fitting errors.</a>
