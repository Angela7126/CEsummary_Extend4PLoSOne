<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We introduce ConnotationWordNet , a connotation lexicon over the network of words in conjunction with senses.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We formulate the lexicon induction problem as collective inference over pairwise-Markov Random Fields, and present a loopy belief propagation algorithm for inference.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The key aspect of our method is that it is the first unified approach that assigns the polarity of both word- and sense-level connotations, exploiting the innate bipartite graph structure encoded in WordNet.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We present comprehensive evaluation to demonstrate the quality and utility of the resulting lexicon in comparison to existing connotation and sentiment lexicons.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have introduced a novel formulation of lexicon induction operating over both words and senses, by exploiting the innate structure between the words and senses as encoded in WordNet.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In addition, we introduce the use of loopy belief propagation over pairwise -Markov Random Fields as an effective lexicon induction algorithm.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A notable strength of our approach is its expressiveness various types of prior knowledge and lexical relations can be encoded as node potentials and edge potentials.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, it leads to a lexicon of better quality while also offering faster run-time and easiness of implementation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The resulting lexicon, called ConnotationWordNet , is the first lexicon that has polarity labels over both words and senses.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>ConnotationWordNet is publicly available for research and practical use.</a>
