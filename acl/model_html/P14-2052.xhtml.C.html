<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Many methods of text summarization combining sentence selection and sentence compression have recently been proposed.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although the dependency between words has been used in most of these methods, the dependency between sentences, i.e.,, rhetorical structures, has not been exploited in such joint methods.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We used both dependency between words and dependency between sentences by constructing a nested tree, in which nodes in the document tree representing dependency between sentences were replaced by a sentence tree representing dependency between words.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We formulated a summarization task as a combinatorial optimization problem, in which the nested tree was trimmed without losing important content in the source document.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results from an empirical evaluation revealed that our method based on the trimming of the nested tree significantly improved the summarization of texts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We proposed a method of summarizing a single document that included relations between sentences and relations between words.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We built a nested tree and formulated the problem of summarization as that of integer linear programming.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our method significantly improved the ROUGE score with significantly fewer sentences than the method of EDU selection.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The results suggest that our method relaxed the fragmentation of information.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We also discussed the effectiveness of sentence subtree selection that did not restrict rooted subtrees.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Although ROUGE scores are widely used as evaluation metrics for text summarization systems, they cannot take into consideration linguistic qualities such as human readability.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Hence, we plan to conduct evaluations with people 7 7 For example, the quality question metric from the Document Understanding Conference (DUC.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We only used the rhetorical structures between sentences in this study.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>However, there were also rhetorical structures between EDUs inside individual sentences.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Hence, utilizing these for sentence compression has been left for future work.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In addition, we used rhetorical structures that were manually annotated.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>There have been related studies on building RST parsers [ 7 , 1 ] and by using such parsers, we should be able to apply our model to other corpora or to multi-document settings.</a>
