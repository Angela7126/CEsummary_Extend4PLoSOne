<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper provides a method for improving tensor-based compositional distributional models of meaning by the addition of an explicit disambiguation step prior to composition..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> In contrast with previous research where this hypothesis has been successfully tested against relatively simple compositional models, in our work we use a robust model trained with linear regression..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The results we get in two experiments show the superiority of the prior disambiguation method and suggest that the effectiveness of this approach is model-independent..</a>
