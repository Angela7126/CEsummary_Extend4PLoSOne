<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Punctuation parsing errors lead to low parsing accuracy on words.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this work, we propose an alternative approach to addressing punctuation in dependency parsing.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rather than assigning lexical heads to punctuations, we treat punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words, used as features to guide the parser to build the dependency graph.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Integrating our method with an arc-standard parser yields a 93.06 % unlabelled attachment score, which is the best accuracy by a single-model transition-based parser reported so far.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this work, we proposed to treat punctuations as properties of context words for dependency parsing.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Experiments with an arc-standard parser showed that our method effectively improves parsing performance and we achieved the best accuracy for single-model transition-based parser.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Regarding punctuation processing for dependency parsing, Li et al.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>2010 ) proposed to utilize punctuations to segment sentences into small fragments and then parse the fragments separately.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A similar approach is proposed by Spitkovsky et al.</a>
