<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper describes a new approach to predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context, i.e.,, whether a verb is used in a stative or dynamic sense..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We identify two challenging cases of this problem when the verb is unseen in training data, and when the verb is ambiguous for aspectual class..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> A semi-supervised approach using linguistically-motivated features and a novel set of distributional features based on representative verb types allows us to predict classes accurately, even for unseen verbs..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Many frequent verbs can be either stative or dynamic in different contexts, which has not been modeled by previous work; we use contextual features to resolve this ambiguity..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In addition, we introduce two new datasets of clauses marked for aspectual class..</a>
