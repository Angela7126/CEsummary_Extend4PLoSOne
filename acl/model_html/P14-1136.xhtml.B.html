<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Finally, we presented results on PropBank-style semantic role labeling with a system that included the task of automatic verb frame identification, in tune with the FrameNet literature; we believe that such a system produces more interpretable output, both from the perspective of human understanding as well as downstream applications, than pipelines that are oblivious to the verb frame, only focusing on argument analysis..</a>
