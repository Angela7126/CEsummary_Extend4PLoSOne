<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a novel approach to cross-lingual model transfer based on feature representation projection.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, a compact feature representation relevant for the task in question is constructed for either language independently and then the mapping between the two representations is determined using parallel data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The target instance can then be mapped into the source-side feature representation using the derived mapping and handled directly by the source-side model.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This approach displays competitive performance on model transfer for semantic role labeling when compared to direct model transfer and annotation projection and suggests interesting directions for further research.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper we propose a new method of cross-lingual model transfer, report initial evaluation results and highlight directions for its further development.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We observe that the performance of this method is competitive with that of established cross-lingual transfer approaches and its application requires very little manual adjustment no heuristics or filtering and no explicit shared feature representation design.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It also retains compatibility with any refinement procedures similar to projected transfer [] that may have been designed to work in conjunction with direct model transfer.</a>
