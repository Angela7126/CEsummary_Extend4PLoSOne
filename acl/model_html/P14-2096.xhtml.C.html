<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Creating cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias is now an important task in the unification of multilingual knowledge bases.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a cross-language article linking method using a mixed-language topic model and hypernym translation features based on an SVM model to link English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike, the most widely used Wiki-like encyclopedia in China.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To evaluate our approach, we compile a data set from the top 500 Baidu Baike articles and their corresponding English Wiki articles.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation results show that our approach achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46% in recall.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different online encyclopedias in other languages.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Cross-language article linking is the task of creating links between online encyclopedia articles in different languages that describe the same content.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We propose a method based on article hypernym and topic model to link English Wikipedia articles to corresponding Chinese Baidu Baike articles.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our method comprises two stages candidate selection and candidate ranking.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We formulate candidate selection as a cross-language information retrieval task based on the title similarity between English and Chinese articles.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In candidate ranking, we employ several features of the articles in our SVM model.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To evaluate our method, we compile a dataset from English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike, containing the 500 most popular Baidu articles.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Evaluation results of our method show an MRR of up to 80.95% and a recall of 87.46%.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This shows that our method is effective in generating cross-language links between English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike with high accuracy.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Our method does not heavily depend on linguistic characteristics and can be easily extended to generate cross-language article links among different encyclopedias in other languages.</a>
