<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper provides a method for improving tensor-based compositional distributional models of meaning by the addition of an explicit disambiguation step prior to composition.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast with previous research where this hypothesis has been successfully tested against relatively simple compositional models, in our work we use a robust model trained with linear regression.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results we get in two experiments show the superiority of the prior disambiguation method and suggest that the effectiveness of this approach is model-independent.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper adds to existing evidence from previous research that the introduction of an explicit disambiguation step before the composition improves the quality of the produced composed representations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The use of a robust regression model rejects the hypothesis that the proposed methodology is helpful only for relatively weak compositional approaches.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As for future work, an interesting direction would be to see how a prior disambiguation step can affect deep learning compositional settings similar to [] and [].</a>
