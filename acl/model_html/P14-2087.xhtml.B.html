<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have proposed a general-purpose Naive Bayes model for measuring association between two sets of random events..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The model replaced string matching in the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation with a probabilistic measure of gloss-context overlap..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The base model on average more than doubled the accuracy of Lesk in Senseval-2 on both fine- and coarse-grained tracks..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> With additional lexical knowledge, the model also outperformed state of the art results with statistical significance on two coarse-grained WSD tasks..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> For future work, we plan to apply the model in other shared tasks, including open-text WSD, so as to compare with more recent Lesk variants..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We would also like to explore how to incorporate syntactic features and employ alternative statistical methods (e.g.,, parametric models) to improve probability estimation and inference..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Other NLP problems involving compositionality in general might also benefit from the proposed many-to-many similarity measure..</a>
