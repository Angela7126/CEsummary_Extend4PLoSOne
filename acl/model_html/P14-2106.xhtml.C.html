<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper presents experiments with WordNet semantic classes to improve dependency parsing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We study the effect of semantic classes in three dependency parsers, using two types of constituency-to-dependency conversions of the English Penn Treebank.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Overall, we can say that the improvements are small and not significant using automatic POS tags, contrary to previously published results using gold POS tags [].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, we explore parser combinations, showing that the semantically enhanced parsers yield a small significant gain only on the more semantically oriented LTH treebank conversion.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This work has tried to shed light on the contribution of semantic information to dependency parsing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The experiments were thorough, testing two treebank conversions and three parsing paradigms on automatically predicted POS tags.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Compared to [] , which used MaltParser on the LTH conversion and gold POS tags, our results can be seen as a negative outcome, as the improvements are very small and non-significant in most of the cases.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For parser combination, WordNet semantic file information does give a small significant increment in the more fine-grained LTH representation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In addition we show that the improvement of automatic clusters is also weak.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For the future, we think tdifferent parsers, eitherhat a more elaborate scheme is needed for word classes, requiring to explore different levels of generalization in the WordNet (or alternative) hierarchies.</a>
