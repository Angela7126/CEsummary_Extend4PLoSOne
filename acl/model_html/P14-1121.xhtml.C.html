<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on the implicit hypothesis that corpora are balanced.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, the historical context-based projection method dedicated to this task is relatively insensitive to the sizes of each part of the comparable corpus.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Within this context, we have carried out a study on the influence of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction through different experiments.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, we have introduced a regression model that boosts the observations of word co-occurrences used in the context-based projection method.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our results show that the use of unbalanced specialized comparable corpora induces a significant gain in the quality of extracted lexicons.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we have studied how an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus could influence the quality of the bilingual lexicon extraction.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This aspect represents a significant interest when working with specialized comparable corpora for which the quantity of the data collected may differ depending on the languages involved, especially when involving the English language as many scientific documents are available.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>More precisely, our different experiments show that using an unbalanced specialized comparable corpus always improves the quality of word translations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, the MAP goes up from 29.6% (best result on the balanced corpora) to 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) in the breast cancer domain, and from 16.5% to 26.0% in the diabetes domain.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Additionally, these results can be improved by using a prediction model of the word co-occurrence counts.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Here, the MAP goes up from 42.3% (best result on the unbalanced corpora) to 46.9% (best result on the unbalanced corpora with prediction) in the breast cancer domain, and from 26.0% to 29.8% in the diabetes domain.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We hope that this study will pave the way for using specialized unbalanced comparable corpora for bilingual lexicon extraction.</a>
