<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Tweets often contain a large proportion of abbreviations, alternative spellings, novel words and other non-canonical language..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> These features are problematic for standard language analysis tools and it can be desirable to convert them to canonical form..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose a novel text normalization model based on learning edit operations from labeled data while incorporating features induced from unlabeled data via character-level neural text embeddings..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The text embeddings are generated using an Simple Recurrent Network..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We find that enriching the feature set with text embeddings substantially lowers word error rates on an English tweet normalization dataset..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our model improves on state-of-the-art with little training data and without any lexical resources..</a>
