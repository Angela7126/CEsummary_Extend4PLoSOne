<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we introduced a novel pre-ordering approach based on dependency parsing for a Chinese-English PBSMT system..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The results showed that our approach achieved a BLEU score gain of 1.61..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Moreover, our dependency-based pre-ordering rule set substantially decreased the time for applying pre-ordering rules about 60% compared with WR07, on the training set of 1M sentences pairs..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The overall accuracy of our rule set is 60.0%, which is almost at the same level as the WR07 rule set..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> These results indicated that dependency parsing is more effective for conducting pre-ordering for Chinese-English PBSMT..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Although our work focused on Chinese, the ideas can also be applied to other languages..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> In the future, we attempt to create more efficient pre-ordering rules by exploiting the rich information in dependency structures..</a>
