<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a study of aspects of discourse structure specifically discourse devices used to organize information in a sentence that significantly impact the quality of machine translation..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our analysis is based on manual evaluations of translations of news from Chinese and Arabic to English..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We find that there is a particularly strong mismatch in the notion of what constitutes a sentence in Chinese and English, which occurs often and is associated with significant degradation in translation quality..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Also related to lower translation quality is the need to employ multiple explicit discourse connectives ( because, but , etc.), as well as the presence of ambiguous discourse connectives in the English translation..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Furthermore, the mismatches between discourse expressions across languages significantly impact translation quality..</a>
