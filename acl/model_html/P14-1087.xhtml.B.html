<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have shown in this work how temporal information in the form of timelines can be incorporated into multi-document summarization..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We achieve this through two means, using..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> 1) three novel features derived from timelines to measure the saliency of sentences, and 2) TimeMMR which considers time span similarity to enhance the traditional MMR s lexical diversity measure..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> To overcome errors propagated from the underlying temporal processing systems, we proposed a reliability filtering metric which can be used to help decide when temporal information should be used for summarization..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The use of this metric leads to an overall 5.9% gain in R-2 over the competitive SWING baseline..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> In future work, we are keen to study our proposed timeline-related features more intrinsically in the context of human-generated summaries..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> This can help us better understand their value in improving content selection..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> As noted earlier, it will be also be useful to repeat our experiments with less lexicon-influenced measures like the Pyramid method [ 20 ]..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Manual assessment of the generated summaries can also be done to give a better picture of the quality of the summaries generated with the use of timelines.Â  Finally, given the importance of reliability filtering, a natural question is if there are other metrics that can be used to get better results..</a>
