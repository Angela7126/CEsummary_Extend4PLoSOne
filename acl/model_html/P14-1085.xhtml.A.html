<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Multi-document summarization (MDS) systems have been designed for short, unstructured summaries of 10-15 documents, and are inadequate for larger document collections..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We propose a new approach to scaling up summarization called hierarchical summarization , and present the first implemented system, Summa..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Summa produces a hierarchy of relatively short summaries, in which the top level provides a general overview and users can navigate the hierarchy to drill down for more details on topics of interest..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Summa optimizes for coherence as well as coverage of salient information..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In an Amazon Mechanical Turk evaluation, users prefered Summa ten times as often as flat MDS and three times as often as timelines..</a>
