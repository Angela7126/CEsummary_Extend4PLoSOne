<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Crowdsourcing is a viable mechanism for creating training data for machine translation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It provides a low cost, fast turn-around way of processing large volumes of data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, when compared to professional translation, naive collection of translations from non-professionals yields low-quality results.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Careful quality control is necessary for crowdsourcing to work well.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we examine the challenges of a two-step collaboration process with translation and post-editing by non-professionals.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We develop graph-based ranking models that automatically select the best output from multiple redundant versions of translations and edits, and improves translation quality closer to professionals.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have proposed an algorithm for using a two-step collaboration between non-professional translators and post-editors to obtain professional-quality translations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our method, based on a co-ranking model, selects the best crowdsourced translation from a set of candidates, and is capable of selecting translations which near professional quality.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Crowdsourcing can play a pivotal role in future efforts to create parallel translation datasets.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In addition to its benefits of cost and scalability, crowdsourcing provides access to languages that currently fall outside the scope of statistical machine translation research.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In future work on crowdsourced translation, further benefits in quality improvement and cost reduction could stem from 1) building ground truth data sets based on high-quality Turkers translations and 2) identifying when sufficient data has been collected for a given input, to avoid soliciting unnecessary redundant translations.</a>
