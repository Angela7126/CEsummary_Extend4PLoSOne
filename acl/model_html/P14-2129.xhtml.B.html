<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We proposed a novel partial parsing approach for applications that require a fast syntactic analysis of the input beyond shallow bracketing..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The span-limit parameter allows tuning the annotation of internal structure as appropriate for the application domain, trading off annotation complexity against inference time..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> These properties make hedge parsing potentially very useful for incremental text or speech processing, such as streaming text analysis or simultaneous translation..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> One interesting characteristic of these annotations is that they allow for string segmentation prior to inference, provided that the segment boundaries do not cross any hedge boundaries..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We found that baseline segmentation models did provide a significant speedup in parsing, but that cascading errors remain a problem..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> There are many directions of future work to pursue here..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> First, the current results are all for exhaustive CYK parsing, and we plan to perform a detailed investigation of the performance of hedgebank parsing with prioritization and pruning methods of the sort available in BUBS [ 2 ]..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Further, this sort of annotation seems well suited to incremental parsing with beam search, which has been shown to achieve high accuracies even for fully connected parsing [ 14 ]..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Improvements to the transform (e.g.,, grouping items not in hedges under non-terminals) and to the segmentation model (e.g.,, increasing precision at the expense of recall) could improve accuracy without greatly reducing efficiency..</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10> Finally, we intend to perform an extrinsic evaluation of this parsing in an on-line task such as simultaneous translation..</a>
