<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Entity clustering must determine when two named-entity mentions refer to the same entity..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Typical approaches use a pipeline architecture that clusters the mentions using fixed or learned measures of name and context similarity..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we propose a model for cross-document coreference resolution that achieves robustness by learning similarity from unlabeled data..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The generative process assumes that each entity mention arises from copying and optionally mutating an earlier name from a similar context..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> Clustering the mentions into entities depends on recovering this copying tree jointly with estimating models of the mutation process and parent selection process..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We present a block Gibbs sampler for posterior inference and an empirical evaluation on several datasets..</a>
