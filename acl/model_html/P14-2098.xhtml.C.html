<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This work explores methods of automatically detecting corrections of individual mistakes in sentence revisions for ESL students.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have trained a classifier that specializes in determining whether consecutive basic-edits (word insertions, deletions, substitutions) address the same mistake.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Experimental result shows that the proposed system achieves an F 1 -score of 81% on correction detection and 66% for the overall system, out-performing the baseline by a large margin.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A revision often contains multiple corrections that address different writing mistakes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We explore building computer programs to accurately detect individual corrections in one single revision.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>One major challenge lies in determining whether consecutive basic-edits address the same mistake.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We propose a classifier specialized in this task.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>2) our method is generalizable over different data collections.</a>
