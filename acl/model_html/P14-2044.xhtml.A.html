<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present a new approach to inducing the syntactic categories of words, combining their distributional and morphological properties in a joint nonparametric Bayesian model based on the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> The prior distribution over word clusterings uses a log-linear model of morphological similarity; the likelihood function is the probability of generating vector word embeddings..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> The weights of the morphology model are learned jointly while inducing part-of-speech clusters, encouraging them to cohere with the distributional features..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> The resulting algorithm outperforms competitive alternatives on English POS induction..</a>
