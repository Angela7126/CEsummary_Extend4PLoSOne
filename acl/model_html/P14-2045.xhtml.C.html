<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A common task in qualitative data analysis is to characterize the usage of a linguistic entity by issuing queries over syntactic relations between words.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Previous interfaces for searching over syntactic structures require programming-style queries.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>User interface research suggests that it is easier to recognize a pattern than to compose it from scratch; therefore, interfaces for non-experts should show previews of syntactic relations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>What these previews should look like is an open question that we explored with a 400-participant Mechanical Turk experiment.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We found that syntactic relations are recognized with 34% higher accuracy when contextual examples are shown than a baseline of naming the relations alone.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This suggests that user interfaces should display contextual examples of syntactic relations to help users choose between different relations.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The results imply that user interfaces for syntactic search should show candidate relationships augmented with a list of phrases in which they occur.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A list of phrases is the most recognizable presentation for clausal relationships (34% better than the baseline), and is as good as a list of words for the other types of relations, except adverb modifiers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For adverb modifiers, the list of words is the most recognizable presentation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This is likely because Enlglish adverbs usually end in -ly are therefore a distinctive set of words.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The list of candidates can be ordered by frequency of occurrence in the collection, or by an interestingness measure given the search word.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As the user becomes more familiar with a given relation, it may be expedient to shorten the cues shown, and then re-introduce them if a relation has not been selected after some period of time has elapsed.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If phrases are used, there is a tradeoff between recognizability and the space required to display the examples of usage.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>However, it is important to keep in mind that because the suggestions are populated with items from the collection itself, they are informative.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The best strategy, phrases , had an overall success rate of only 55%, although the intended user base may have more familiarity with grammatical relations than the participants did, and therefore may perform better in practice.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Nonetheless, there is room for improvement in scores, and it may be that additional visual cues, such as some kind of bracketing, will improve results.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Furthermore, the current study did not test three-word relationships or more complex combinations of structures, and those may require improvements to the design.</a>
