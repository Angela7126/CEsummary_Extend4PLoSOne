<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper 1 1 This work was done while the first author was visiting SUTD we address the problem of web-domain POS tagging using a two-phase approach.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first phase learns representations that capture regularities underlying web text.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The representation is integrated as features into a neural network that serves as a scorer for an easy-first POS tagger.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Parameters of the neural network are trained using guided learning in the second phase.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiment on the SANCL 2012 shared task show that our approach achieves 93.27 % average tagging accuracy, which is the best accuracy reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We built a web-domain POS tagger using a two-phase approach.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We used a WRRBM to learn the representation of the web text and incorporate the representation in a neural network, which is trained using guided learning for easy-first POS tagging.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Experiment showed that our approach achieved significant improvement in tagging the web domain text.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In addition, we found that keeping the learned representations unchanged yields better performance compared with further optimizing them on the source domain data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We release our tools at https://github.com/majineu/TWeb.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For future work, we would like to investigate the two-phase approach to more challenging tasks, such as web domain syntactic parsing.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We believe that high-accuracy web domain taggers and parsers would benefit a wide range of downstream tasks such as machine translation.</a>
