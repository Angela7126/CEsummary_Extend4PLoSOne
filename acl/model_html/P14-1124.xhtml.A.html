<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We aim to improve spoken term detection performance by incorporating contextual information beyond traditional N-gram language models..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Instead of taking a broad view of topic context in spoken documents, variability of word co-occurrence statistics across corpora leads us to focus instead the on phenomenon of word repetition within single documents..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We show that given the detection of one instance of a term we are more likely to find additional instances of that term in the same document..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We leverage this burstiness of keywords by taking the most confident keyword hypothesis in each document and interpolating with lower scoring hits..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We then develop a principled approach to select interpolation weights using only the ASR training data..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Using this re-weighting approach we demonstrate consistent improvement in the term detection performance across all five languages in the BABEL program..</a>
