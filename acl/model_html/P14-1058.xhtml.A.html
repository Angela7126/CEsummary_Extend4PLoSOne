<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although the distributional hypothesis has been applied successfully in many natural language processing tasks, systems using distributional information have been limited to a single domain because the distribution of a word can vary between domains as the word s predominant meaning changes..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, if it were possible to predict how the distribution of a word changes from one domain to another, the predictions could be used to adapt a system trained in one domain to work in another..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We propose an unsupervised method to predict the distribution of a word in one domain, given its distribution in another domain..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We evaluate our method on two tasks cross-domain part-of-speech tagging and cross-domain sentiment classification..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In both tasks, our method significantly outperforms competitive baselines and returns results that are statistically comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while requiring no task-specific customisations..</a>
