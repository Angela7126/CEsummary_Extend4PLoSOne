<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we reformulated the traditional linear vector-space models as tensor-space models, and proposed an online learning algorithm named Tensor-MIRA..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> A tensor-space model is a compact representation of data, and via rank-1 tensor approximation, the weight tensor can be made highly structured hence the number of parameters to be trained is significantly reduced..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This can be regarded as a form of model regularization.Therefore, compared with the traditional vector-space models, learning in the tensor space is very effective when a large feature set is defined, but only small amount of training data is available..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our experimental results corroborated this argument..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> As mentioned in Section 3.2 , one interesting problem that merits further investigation is how to determine optimal mode sizes..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> The challenge of applying a tensor model comes from finding a proper tensor structure for a given problem, and the key to solving this problem is to find a balance between the model complexity (indicated by the order and sizes of modes) and the number of parameters..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Developing a theoretically guaranteed approach of finding the optimal structure for a given task will make the tensor model not only perform well in low-resource environments, but adaptive to larger data sets..</a>
