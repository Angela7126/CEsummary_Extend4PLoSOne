<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we propose a novel Emotion-aware LDA (EaLDA) model to build a domain-specific lexicon for predefined emotions that include anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The model uses a minimal set of domain-independent seed words as prior knowledge to discover a domain-specific lexicon, learning a fine-grained emotion lexicon much richer and adaptive to a specific domain.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By comprehensive experiments, we show that our model can generate a high-quality fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we have presented a novel emotion-aware LDA model that is able to quickly build a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for languages without many manually constructed resources.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The proposed EaLDA model extends the standard LDA model by accepting a set of domain-independent emotion words as prior knowledge, and guiding to group semantically related words into the same emotion category.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus, it makes the emotion lexicon containing much richer and adaptive domain-specific emotion words.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Experimental results showed that the emotional lexicons generated by our algorithm is of high quality, and can assist emotion classification task.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For future works, we hope to extend the proposed EaLDA model by exploiting discourse structure knowledge, which has been shown significant in identifying the polarity of content-aware words.</a>
