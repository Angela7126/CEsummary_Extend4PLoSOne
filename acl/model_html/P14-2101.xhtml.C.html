<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Latent topics derived by topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are the result of hidden thematic structures which provide further insights into the data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The automatic labelling of such topics derived from social media poses however new challenges since topics may characterise novel events happening in the real world.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Existing automatic topic labelling approaches which depend on external knowledge sources become less applicable here since relevant articles/concepts of the extracted topics may not exist in external sources.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper we propose to address the problem of automatic labelling of latent topics learned from Twitter as a summarisation problem.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We introduce a framework which apply summarisation algorithms to generate topic labels.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These algorithms are independent of external sources and only rely on the identification of dominant terms in documents related to the latent topic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We compare the efficiency of existing state of the art summarisation algorithms.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our results suggest that summarisation algorithms generate better topic labels which capture event-related context compared to the top- n terms returned by LDA.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper we proposed a novel alternative to topic labelling which do not rely on external data sources.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To the best of out knowledge no existing work has been formally studied for automatic labelling through summarisation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This experiment shows that existing summarisation techniques can be exploited to provide a better label of a topic, extending in this way a topic s information by providing a richer context than top-terms.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>These results show that there is room to further improve upon existing summarisation techniques to cater for generating candidate labels.</a>
