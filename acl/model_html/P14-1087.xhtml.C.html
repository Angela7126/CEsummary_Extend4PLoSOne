<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We study the use of temporal information in the form of timelines to enhance multi-document summarization.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We employ a fully automated temporal processing system to generate a timeline for each input document.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We derive three features from these timelines, and show that their use in supervised summarization lead to a significant 4.1% improvement in ROUGE performance over a state-of-the-art baseline.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, we propose TimeMMR , a modification to Maximal Marginal Relevance that promotes temporal diversity by way of computing time span similarity, and show its utility in summarizing certain document sets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also propose a filtering metric to discard noisy timelines generated by our automatic processes, to purify the timeline input for summarization.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By selectively using timelines guided by filtering, overall summarization performance is increased by a significant 5.9%.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We have shown in this work how temporal information in the form of timelines can be incorporated into multi-document summarization.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We achieve this through two means, using.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>1) three novel features derived from timelines to measure the saliency of sentences, and 2) TimeMMR which considers time span similarity to enhance the traditional MMR s lexical diversity measure.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To overcome errors propagated from the underlying temporal processing systems, we proposed a reliability filtering metric which can be used to help decide when temporal information should be used for summarization.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The use of this metric leads to an overall 5.9% gain in R-2 over the competitive SWING baseline.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In future work, we are keen to study our proposed timeline-related features more intrinsically in the context of human-generated summaries.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This can help us better understand their value in improving content selection.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As noted earlier, it will be also be useful to repeat our experiments with less lexicon-influenced measures like the Pyramid method [ 20 ].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Manual assessment of the generated summaries can also be done to give a better picture of the quality of the summaries generated with the use of timelines. Finally, given the importance of reliability filtering, a natural question is if there are other metrics that can be used to get better results.</a>
