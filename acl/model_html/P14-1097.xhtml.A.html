<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We present an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes from verb uses in giga-word corpora..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> By taking this step-wise approach, we can not only generate verb classes based on a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy, which is bypassed by most of the previous studies on verb clustering..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> In our experiments, we acquire semantic frames and verb classes from two giga-word corpora, the larger comprising 20 billion words..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> The effectiveness of our approach is verified through quantitative evaluations based on polysemy-aware gold-standard data..</a>
