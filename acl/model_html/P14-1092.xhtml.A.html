<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose a robust answer reranking model for non-factoid questions that integrates lexical semantics with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers, and a deep one based on Rhetorical Structure Theory..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We evaluate the proposed model on two corpora from different genres and domains one from Yahoo..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Answers and one from the biology domain, and two types of non-factoid questions manner and reason..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We experimentally demonstrate that the discourse structure of non-factoid answers provides information that is complementary to lexical semantic similarity between question and answer, improving performance up to 24% (relative) over a state-of-the-art model that exploits lexical semantic similarity alone..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We further demonstrate excellent domain transfer of discourse information, suggesting these discourse features have general utility to non-factoid question answering..</a>
