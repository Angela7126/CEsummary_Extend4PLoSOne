<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The primary way of providing real-time speech to text captioning for hard of hearing people is to employ expensive professional stenographers who can type as fast as natural speaking rates.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recent work has shown that a feasible alternative is to combine the partial captions of ordinary typists, each of whom is able to type only part of what they hear.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we extend the state of the art fixed-window alignment algorithm [] for combining the individual captions into a final output sequence.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our method performs alignment on a sliding window of the input sequences, drastically reducing both the number of errors and the latency of the system to the end user over the previously published approaches.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we present a novel sliding window based text alignment algorithm for real-time crowd captioning.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By effectively addressing the problem of alignment errors at chunk boundaries, our sliding window approach outperforms the existing fixed window based system [] in terms of word error rate, particularly when the chunk size is small, and thus achieves higher accuracy at lower latency.</a>
