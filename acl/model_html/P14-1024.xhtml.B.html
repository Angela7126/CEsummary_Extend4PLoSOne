<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The key contribution of our work is that we show how to identify metaphors across languages by building a model in English and applying it without adaptation to other languages..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> Spanish, Farsi, and Russian..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> This model uses language-independent (rather than lexical or language specific) conceptual features..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Not only do we establish benchmarks for Spanish, Farsi, and Russian, but we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in English..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In addition, we present a comparison of relative contributions of several types of features..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> We concentrate on metaphors in the context of two kinds of syntactic relations subject-verb-object (SVO) relations and adjective-noun (AN) relations, which account for a majority of all metaphorical phrases..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> Future work will expand the scope of metaphor identification by including nominal metaphoric relations as well as explore techniques for incorporating contextual features, which can play a key role in identifying certain kinds of metaphors..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> Second, cross-lingual model transfer can be improved with more careful cross-lingual feature projection..</a>
