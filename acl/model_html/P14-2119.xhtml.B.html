<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We show that relation extractors trained with distant supervision can benefit significantly from a small number of human labeled examples..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We propose a strategy to generate and select guidelines so that they are more generalized forms of labeled instances..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> We show how to incorporate these guidelines into an existing state-of-art model for relation extraction..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our approach significantly improves performance in practice and thus opens up many opportunities for further research in RE where only a very limited amount of labeled training data is available..</a>
