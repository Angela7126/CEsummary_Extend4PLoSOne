<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Lexical resource alignment has been an active field of research over the last decade..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, prior methods for aligning lexical resources have been either specific to a particular pair of resources, or heavily dependent on the availability of hand-crafted alignment data for the pair of resources to be aligned..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Here we present a unified approach that can be applied to an arbitrary pair of lexical resources, including machine-readable dictionaries with no network structure..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> Our approach leverages a similarity measure that enables the structural comparison of senses across lexical resources, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the task of aligning WordNet to three different collaborative resources..</a>
