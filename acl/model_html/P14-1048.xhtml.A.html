<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> However, their model has a high order of time complexity, and thus cannot be applied in practice..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> In this work, we develop a much faster model whose time complexity is linear in the number of sentences..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Our model adopts a greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as local classifiers..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> In addition to efficiency, our parser also significantly outperforms the state of the art..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> Moreover, our novel approach of post-editing, which modifies a fully-built tree by considering information from constituents on upper levels, can further improve the accuracy..</a>
