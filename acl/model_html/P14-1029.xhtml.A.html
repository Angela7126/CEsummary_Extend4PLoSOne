<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Negation words, such as no and not , play a fundamental role in modifying sentiment of textual expressions..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> We will refer to a negation word as the negator and the text span within the scope of the negator as the argument..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> Commonly used heuristics to estimate the sentiment of negated expressions rely simply on the sentiment of argument (and not on the negator or the argument itself..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> We use a sentiment treebank to show that these existing heuristics are poor estimators of sentiment..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5> We then modify these heuristics to be dependent on the negators and show that this improves prediction..</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6> Next, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model [] that relies on both the negator and the argument..</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7> This model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator s argument with a recursive neural network..</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8> We show that this approach performs better than those mentioned above..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9> In addition, we explicitly incorporate the prior sentiment of the argument and observe that this information can help reduce fitting errors..</a>
