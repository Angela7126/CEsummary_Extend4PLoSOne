<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) usually utilizes contextual information to disambiguate translation candidates..</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2> However, it is often limited to contexts within sentence boundaries, hence broader topical information cannot be leveraged..</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3> In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic representation for parallel data using a neural network architecture, where abundant topical contexts are embedded via topic relevant monolingual data..</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4> By associating each translation rule with the topic representation, topic relevant rules are selected according to the distributional similarity with the source text during SMT decoding..</a>
