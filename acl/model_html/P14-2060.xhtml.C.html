<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Incorrect normalization of text can be particularly damaging for applications like text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) or typing auto-correction, where the resulting normalization is directly presented to the user, versus feeding downstream applications.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we focus on abbreviation expansion for TTS, which requires a do no harm , high precision approach yielding few expansion errors at the cost of leaving relatively many abbreviations unexpanded.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the context of a large-scale, real-world TTS scenario, we present methods for training classifiers to establish whether a particular expansion is apt.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We achieve a large increase in correct abbreviation expansion when combined with the baseline text normalization component of the TTS system, together with a substantial reduction in incorrect expansions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper we have presented methods for high precision abbreviation expansion for a TTS application.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The methods are largely self-organizing, using in-domain unannotated data, and depend on only a small amount of annotated data.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since the SVM features relate to general properties of abbreviations, expansions and contexts, the classifier parameters will likely carry over to new (English) domains.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We demonstrate that in combination with a hand-built TTS baseline, the methods afford dramatic improvement in the TP rate (to about 74% from a starting point of about 40%) and a reduction of FP to below our goal of 2%.</a>
