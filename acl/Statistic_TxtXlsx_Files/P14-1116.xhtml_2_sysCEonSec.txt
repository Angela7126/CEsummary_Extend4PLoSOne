	CASE: 8
	Stag: 17 
		Pattern: 35 [['thus']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: However, simple classification assumes that the templates are independent of each other, thus the decision for each template is taken in isolation from the others, which is not appropriate for our domain.

	CASE: 9
	Stag: 20 
		Pattern: 0 [[['by', 'through']]]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&V-ing@C@']]

		sentTXT: The difference between the two methods lies in that the collective content selection requires the consideration of an individual preference score (which is defined as the preference of the entity to be selected or omitted, and it is based on the values of entity attributes and is computed using a boosting algorithm) and the identification of links between the entities with similar labels.

		sentTXT: Finally, our domain for feedback generation is motivated by previous studies [] who show that text summaries are more effective in decision making than graphs therefore it is advantageous to provide a summary over showing users the raw data graphically.

		sentTXT: Our analysis of the dataset showed that there are significant correlations between the factors, for example, the number of lectures attended (LA) correlates with the student u'\u2019' s understanding of the material (Und), see Table 5. As we will discuss further in Section 5.1 , content decisions are influenced by the previously generated content, for example, if the lecturer has previously mentioned health_issues, mentioning hours_studied has a high probability of also being mentioned.

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 77 78 
		Pattern: 62 [['therefore']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['(,)', '&R']]
		sentTXT: Instead of dealing with this task in a hierarchical way, where the algorithm will first learn whether to talk about a factor and then to decide how to refer to it, we transformed the task in order to reduce the learning steps. Therefore, classification can reduce the decision workload by deciding either in which way to talk about it, or not to talk about a factor at all.

	CASE: 5
	Stag: 156 
		Pattern: 7 [['hence']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['(,)', '&R']]
		sentTXT: On the contrary, the RL is trained to optimise the selected content and not to replicate the existing lecturer summaries, hence there is a difference in accuracy.

	CASE: 6
	Stag: 158 
		Pattern: 62 [['therefore']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['(,)', '&R']]
		sentTXT: RL is trained to optimise for this function, and therefore it achieves higher reward, whereas ML is trained to learn by examples, therefore it produces output closer to the gold standard (lecturer u'\u2019' s produced summaries.

	CASE: 9
	Stag: 165 166

		sentTXT: On the other hand, when mentioning the average difficulty the summary is u'\u201c' punished u'\u201d' with -81 (see description of the reward function in Section 5.2. Consequently, a single poor decision in the ML classification can result in much less reward.

	CASE: 10
	Stag: 174

		sentTXT: We have shown that ML classification for summarisation of our time-series data has an accuracy of 76.95% and that this approach significantly outperforms other classification methods as it is able to capture dependencies in the data when making content selection decisions. 
		Cause: [(0, 28), (0, 41)]

		sentTXT: This may be due to the fact that the RL optimisation method is able to provide more varied responses over time rather than just emulating the training data as with standard supervised learning approaches. Foster \shortcite Foster2008 found similar results when performing a study on generation of emphatic facial displays. 
		Cause: [(0, 29), (1, 15)]

	Stag: 182 
		Pattern: 0 [['if']]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&C@Complete@']]

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 187 
		Pattern: 0 [['according', 'to']]---- [['&R', '(,)'], ['&NP@C@']]

	CASE: 5
	Stag: 188 
		Pattern: 407 [['because']]---- [['&R', '(,)', '(&ADV)'], ['&C']]
		sentTXT: ML classification could be used when the goal of the generation is to replicate phenomena seen in the dataset, because it achieves high accuracy, precision and recall.
