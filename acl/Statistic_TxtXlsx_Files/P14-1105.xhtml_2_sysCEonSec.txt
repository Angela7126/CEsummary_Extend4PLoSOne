Section 0:  Abstract has 1 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 2 
		Pattern: 30 []---- [['&V-ing@C@', '(,)', '&R@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: Taking inspiration from recent work in sentiment analysis that successfully models the compositional aspect of language, we apply a recursive neural network ( RNN ) framework to the task of identifying the political position evinced by a sentence. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 15)]
		Effect: [(0, 17), (0, 38)]

Section 1:  1 Introduction has 4 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 6 
		Pattern: 47 [['so'], ['that']]---- [['&C'], ['&adj/&adv@C@'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Many of the issues discussed by politicians and the media are so nuanced that even word choice entails choosing an ideological position. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 12)]
		Effect: [(0, 14), (0, 20)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 13 
		Pattern: 0 [['if']]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: We say a sentence contains ideological bias if its author u'\u2019' s political position (here liberal or conservative , in the sense of U.S politics) is evident from the text. 
		Cause: [(0, 8), (0, 35)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 6)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 17 
		Pattern: 35 [['thus']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Existing approaches toward bias detection have not gone far beyond u'\u201c' bag of words u'\u201d' classifiers, thus ignoring richer linguistic context of this kind and often operating at the level of whole documents. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 23)]
		Effect: [(0, 26), (0, 41)]

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 20 
		Pattern: 265 [['so']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['(-far)', '(,)', '&R']]
		sentTXT: This model requires richer data than currently available, so we develop a new political ideology dataset annotated at the phrase level. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 7)]
		Effect: [(0, 10), (0, 21)]

Section 2:  2 Recursive Neural Networks has 10 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 25 
		Pattern: 0 [[['by', 'through']]]---- [[], ['&V-ing@C@', '&R']]
		sentTXT: By taking into account the hierarchical nature of language, rnn s can model semantic composition , which is the principle that a phrase u'\u2019' s meaning is a combination of the meaning of the words within that phrase and the syntax that combines those words. 
		Cause: [(0, 1), (0, 8)]
		Effect: [(0, 9), (0, 49)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 27 
		Pattern: 15 [['since'], [',']]---- [[], ['&C@NCTime@'], ['&R@NCTime@']]
		sentTXT: Since most ideological bias becomes identifiable only at higher levels of sentence trees (as verified by our annotation, Figure 4 ), models relying primarily on word-level distributional statistics are not desirable for our problem. 
		Cause: [(0, 1), (0, 18)]
		Effect: [(0, 20), (0, 36)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 29 
		Pattern: 0 [['based', 'on'], [',']]---- [[], ['&V-ing/&NP@C@', '(&Clause@C@)'], ['&R']]

		sentTXT: These phrase vectors should represent the meaning of the phrases composed of individual words. As phrases themselves merge into complete sentences, the underlying vector representation is trained to retain the sentence u'\u2019' s whole meaning. 
		Cause: [(1, 1), (1, 25)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 13)]

	CASE: 6
	Stag: 34

	CASE: 7
	Stag: 39 
		Pattern: 0 [[['by', 'through']]]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&V-ing@C@']]

		sentTXT: When initializing our model, we have two choices we can initialize all of our parameters randomly or provide the model some prior knowledge. As we see in Section 4 , these choices have a significant effect on final performance. 
		Cause: [(1, 1), (1, 15)]
		Effect: [(0, 1), (0, 23)]

	CASE: 9

		sentTXT: The word2vec embeddings have linear relationships (e.g.,, the closest vectors to the average of u'\u201c' green u'\u201d' and u'\u201c' energy u'\u201d' include phrases such as u'\u201c' renewable energy u'\u201d' , u'\u201c' eco-friendly u'\u201d' , and u'\u201c' efficient lightbulbs u'\u201d'. To preserve these relationships as phrases are formed in our sentences, we initialize our left and right composition matrices such that parent vector p is computed by taking the average of children a and b ( W L = W R = 0.5 u'\u2062' u'\ud835' u'\udd40' d Ã— d. 
		Cause: [(1, 5), (1, 58)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (1, 3)]

	CASE: 10
	Stag: 57

	CASE: 6
	Stag: 89 
		Pattern: 18 [['because'], [',']]---- [[], ['&C'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Because our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as u'\u201c' neutral u'\u201d' or u'\u201c' biased u'\u201d' , we filter the dataset further using dualist [ 23 ] , an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences in our dataset.
