P14-2104.xhtml_2's CE cases

Section 0:  Abstract has 2 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 2 
		Pattern: 0 [[['by', 'through']]]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&V-ing@C@']]
		sentTXT: We then develop a supervised SRL model by leveraging morphological features of Korean that tend to correspond with semantic roles. 
		Cause: [(0, 8), (0, 19)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 6)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 3 4 
		Pattern: 0 [[['lead', 'leads', 'led'], 'to']]---- [['&C', '(,/./;/--)', '&this', '(&adj)', '(&N)', '(&CAN/have/has/had)', '(&ADV)'], ['&NP@R@']]
		sentTXT: Our model also employs a variety of latent morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text. These elements lead to state-of-the-art performance of 81.07% labeled F1, representing the best SRL performance reported to date for an agglutinative language. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 18)]
		Effect: [(1, 4), (1, 23)]

Section 1:  1 Introduction has 3 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 6 
		Pattern: 15 [['since'], [',']]---- [[], ['&C@NCTime@'], ['&R@NCTime@']]
		sentTXT: Ever since Gildea and Jurafsky [ 9 ] , SRL has become an important technology used in applications requiring semantic interpretation, ranging from information extraction [ 8 ] and question answering [ 14 ] , to practical problems including textual entailment [ 4 ] and pictorial communication systems [ 10 ]. 
		Cause: [(0, 2), (0, 7)]
		Effect: [(0, 9), (0, 51)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 7 8 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: SRL systems in many languages have been developed as the necessary linguistic resources become available [ 18 , 20 , 5 , 12 ]. Seven languages were the subject of the CoNLL-2009 shared task in syntactic and semantic parsing [ 11 ]. 
		Cause: [(0, 9), (1, 16)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 7)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 13 
		Pattern: 0 [['due', 'to']]---- [['&R'], ['&NP@C@']]
		sentTXT: Agglutinative languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish are computationally difficult due to word-form sparsity, variable word order, and the challenge of using rich morphological features. 
		Cause: [(0, 15), (0, 29)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 12)]

Section 2:  2 A Semantically Annotated Korean Corpus has 7 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 25 26 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: We view our work as building on the efforts of the Penn Korean PropBank (PKPB. 2 2 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T03 Our corpus is roughly similar in size to the PKPB, and taken together, the two Korean corpora now total about half the size of the Penn English PropBank. 
		Cause: [(0, 5), (1, 32)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 3)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 28 
		Pattern: 25 [['for']]---- [['&R'], ['&V-ing@C@']]
		sentTXT: Our experiments will show that these finer-grained tags are crucial for achieving high SRL accuracy. 
		Cause: [(0, 11), (0, 14)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 9)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 40 
		Pattern: 0 [['based', 'on'], [',']]---- [[], ['&V-ing/&NP@C@', '(&Clause@C@)'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Although these are based on the general English PropBank guidelines [ 3 ] , they also differ in that we used only 4 numbered arguments from ARG0 to ARG3 instead of 5 numbered arguments. 
		Cause: [(0, 5), (0, 12)]
		Effect: [(0, 14), (0, 33)]

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 40 41 
		Pattern: 35 [['thus']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Although these are based on the general English PropBank guidelines [ 3 ] , they also differ in that we used only 4 numbered arguments from ARG0 to ARG3 instead of 5 numbered arguments. We thus consider 17 semantic roles in total. 
		Cause: [(0, 1), (1, 0)]
		Effect: [(1, 2), (1, 7)]

	CASE: 5
	Stag: 44 
		Pattern: 0 [[['by', 'through']]]---- [[], ['&V-ing@C@', '&R']]
		sentTXT: We have annotated semantic roles by following the PropBank annotation guideline [ 3 ] and by using frame files of the Penn Korean PropBank built by Palmer et al. 
		Cause: [(0, 6), (0, 13)]
		Effect: [(0, 14), (0, 27)]

	CASE: 6
	Stag: 46 
		Pattern: 18 [['because'], [',']]---- [[], ['&C'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: The PropBank and our corpus are not exactly compatible, because the former is built on constituency-based parse trees, whereas our corpus uses dependency parses. 
		Cause: [(0, 11), (0, 18)]
		Effect: [(0, 20), (0, 25)]

	CASE: 7
	Stag: 50 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: Using coarser suffix tags can seriously degrade SRL performance, as we show in Section 6 , where we compare the performance of our model on both the new corpus and the older PKPB. 
		Cause: [(0, 11), (0, 33)]
		Effect: [(0, 1), (0, 8)]

Section 3:  3 Previous Work has 4 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 51 52 
		Pattern: 62 [['therefore']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['(,)', '&R']]
		sentTXT: Korean SRL research has been limited to domestically published Korean research on small corpora. Therefore, the most direct precedent to the present work is a section in Bj√∂rkelund et al. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 13)]
		Effect: [(1, 2), (1, 17)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 57 58 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: This result showcases the computational difficulty of dealing with morphologically rich agglutinative languages. As we discuss in Section 5 , we utilize these same features, but also add a set of Korean-specific features to capture aspects of Korean morphology. 
		Cause: [(1, 1), (1, 12)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 12)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 59 60 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: Besides these morphological features, we also employ latent continuous and discrete morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text. As our experiments below show, these features improve performance by dealing with sparsity issues. 
		Cause: [(1, 1), (1, 14)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 22)]

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 62 63 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: Unlike the English models, we use individual morphemes as our unit of analysis. For the semantic role task, the input is a sentence consisting of a sequence of words x = x 1 , u'\u2026' , x n and the output is a sequence of corresponding semantic tags y = y 1 , u'\u2026' , y n. 
		Cause: [(0, 10), (1, 51)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 8)]

Section 4:  4 Model has 0 CE cases
Section 5:  5 Features has 4 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 71 72 
		Pattern: 26 [['as']]---- [['&R@Complete@', '(,)', '(-such/-same/-seem/-regard/-regards/-regarded/-view/-views/-viewed/-denote/-denoted/-denotes)'], ['(-if/-follow/-follows/-&adv)', '&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: These features are categorized as either general features, Korean-specific features, or latent morpheme representation features. Korean-specific features are built upon the morphological analysis of the suffix agglutination of the current word x i. 
		Cause: [(0, 5), (1, 16)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 3)]

	CASE: 2
	Stag: 74 75 
		Pattern: 35 [['thus']]---- [['&C', '(,/;/./--)', '(&AND)'], ['&R']]
		sentTXT: Josa is used to define nominal cases and modify other phrases, while Eomi is an ending of a verb or an adjective to define a tense, show an attitude, and connect or terminate a sentence. Thus, the Eomi and Josa categorization plays an important role in signaling semantic roles. 
		Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 37)]
		Effect: [(1, 1), (1, 14)]

	CASE: 3
	Stag: 85 
		Pattern: 0 [[['if', 'once']], [',']]---- [[], ['&C@Complete@'], ['&R@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: If POS_Lv1 is noun , either a proper noun, common noun, or other kinds of nouns is the POS_Lv2. 
		Cause: [(0, 1), (0, 3)]
		Effect: [(0, 5), (0, 18)]

	CASE: 4
	Stag: 91 
		Pattern: 0 [['if']]---- [['&R@Complete@'], ['&C@Complete@']]
		sentTXT: It is set to 1 if any Josa exists, otherwise 0. 
		Cause: [(0, 6), (0, 11)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 4)]

Section 6:  6 Experiments and Results has 1 CE cases
	CASE: 1
	Stag: 121 122 
		Pattern: 8 [['because']]---- [['&R', '(,/./;/--)', '(&AND)', '&THIS', '&BE', '(&ADV)'], ['&C']]
		sentTXT: Although both the PKPB and our corpus had improvements, the improvements were the most notable on our corpus. This is because PKPB POS tags might be too coarse. 
		Cause: [(1, 3), (1, 9)]
		Effect: [(0, 0), (0, 18)]

Section 7:  7 Conclusion has 0 CE cases
