	sentTXT: The task is to predict the root sentiment label of each parse tree; however, because the data is annotated with sentiment at each span of each parse tree, we can also evaluate how well our model does at these intermediate computations
	Cause: [(0, 17), (0, 29)]
	Effect: [(0, 31), (0, 43)]

CASE: 52
Stag: 179 
	Pattern: 45 [['so', 'that']]---- [['&C'], ['&R']]
	sentTXT: Following their experimental conditions, we filter the test set so that it only contains trees with non-neutral sentiment labels at the root
	Cause: [(0, 0), (0, 9)]
	Effect: [(0, 12), (0, 22)]
