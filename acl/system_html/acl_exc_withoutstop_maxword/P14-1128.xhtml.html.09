<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The type-level word boundary distributions, induced by the character-based alignment (VES-NO-GP), and the graph propagation (VES-GP-PL), are regarded as virtual evidences to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on the unlabeled data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An intuitive manner is to directly leverage the induced boundary distributions as label constraints to regularize segmentation model learning, based on a constrained learning algorithm</a>
