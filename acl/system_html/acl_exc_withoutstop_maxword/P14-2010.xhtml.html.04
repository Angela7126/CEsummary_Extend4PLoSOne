<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words</a>
