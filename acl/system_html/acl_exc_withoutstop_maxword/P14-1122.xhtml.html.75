<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For all three games, two players play the same game under time limits and then are rewarded if their answers match</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These mechanics ensure the game naturally produces better quality annotations; in contrast, common crowdsourcing platforms do not support analogous mechanics for enforcing this type of correctness at annotation time</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The strength of both crowdsourcing and games with a purpose comes from aggregating multiple annotations of a single item; i.e.,, while IAA may be low, the majority annotation of an item may be correct</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing</a>
