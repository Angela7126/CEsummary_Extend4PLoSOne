VWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence
p1
aVIn the example shown in Figure 1 , the correction u'\u005cu201c' to change u'\u005cu21d2' changing u'\u005cu201d' is composed of a deletion of to and a substitution from change to changing ; the correction u'\u005cu201c' moment u'\u005cu21d2' minute u'\u005cu201d' is itself a single word substitution
p2
aVFirst, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced

aVAlso, as
