VThe binary result is based on a DCNN that has a wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a dynamic k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity; it has a second wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity

aVIncreasing m or stacking multiple convolutional layers of the narrow type makes the range of the feature detectors larger; at the same time it also exacerbates the neglect of the margins of the sentence and increases the minimum size s of the input sentence required by the convolution
