<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two categories of clues that implicitly capture relations u'\u2019' backgrounds their expected argument types and argument cardinalities, based on which we can discover two categories of disagreements among the candidate predictions, summarized as argument type inconsistencies and violations of arguments u'\u2019' uniqueness, which have been rarely considered before</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As discussed above, given a set of entity pairs and their candidate relations output by a preliminary extractor, our goal is to find an optimal configuration for all those entities pairs jointly, solving the disagreements among those candidate predictions and maximizing the overall confidence of the</a>
