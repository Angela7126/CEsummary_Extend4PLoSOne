<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The discourse parser model (DPM) is based on the RST discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So far, we have treated LS and discourse as distinct features in the reranking model, However, given that LS features greatly improve the CR baseline, we hypothesize that a natural extension to the discourse models would be to make use of LS similarity (in addition to the traditional information retrieval similarity) to label discourse segments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The first is a measure of the overall LS similarity of the question and answer candidate, which is computed as the cosine similarity between the two composite vectors of the question and the answer candidate</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To tease apart the relative contribution of discourse features that occur only within a single sentence versus features that span multiple sentences, we examined the performance of the full model when</a>
