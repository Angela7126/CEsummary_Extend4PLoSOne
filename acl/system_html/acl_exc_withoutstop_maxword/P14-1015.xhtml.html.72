<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Having exhausted the two obvious textual features for solution identification, subsequent approaches have largely used the presence of lexical cues signifying solution-like narrative (e.g.,, instructive narratives such as u'\u201d' check the router for any connection issues u'\u201d' ) as the primary content-based feature for solution identification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Usage of translation models for modeling the correlation between textual problems and solutions have been explored earlier starting from the answer retrieval work in [ 18 ] where new queries were conceptually expanded using the translation model to improve retrieval</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The cornerstone of our technique is the usage of a hitherto unexplored textual feature, lexical correlations between problems and solutions , that is exploited along with language model based characterization of solution posts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Infact, the assumption that similar problems have similar solutions (of which the correlation assumption is an offshoot) forms the foundation of case-based reasoning systems [ 11 ] , a kind of knowledge reuse systems that could be the natural consumers of problem-solution pairs mined from forums</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On medical forums, privacy considerations may force forum data to be dumped without author information, making a host of author-id based features unavailable</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Though such assumptions on structural features, if generic enough, may be built into unsupervised techniques to aid solution identification, the variation in availability of such features across forums limits</a>
