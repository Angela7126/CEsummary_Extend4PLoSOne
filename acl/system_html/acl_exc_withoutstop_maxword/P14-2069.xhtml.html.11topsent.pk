VHowever, since a specific word can carry various emotions in different domains, a general-purpose emotion lexicon is less accurate and less informative than a domain-specific lexicon [ 1 ]
p1
aVWe descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output
p2
aVOur approach is a weakly supervised approach since only some seeds emotion sentiment words are needed to lanch the process of lexicon construction
p3
aVLastly, previous emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on many manually constructed resources (e.g.,, emotion lexicon, parsers, etc
p4
aVThe emotion (or non-emotion) topic is sampled according to a multinomial distribution Mult u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu0398' ( e ) ) (or Mult u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu0398' ( n ) )
p5
aVThe proposed EaLDA model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] model by employing a small set of seeds to guide the model generating topics
