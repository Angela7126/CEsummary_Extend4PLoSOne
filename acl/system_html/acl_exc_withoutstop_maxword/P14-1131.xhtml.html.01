<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Apart from SimRank, extensions of PageRank are the main methods for computing the similarity of nodes in graphs in NLP (e.g.,, Hughes and Ramage ( 2007 ) , Agirre et al</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>CoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In Section 4 , we compare CoSimRank and SimRank</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time</a>
