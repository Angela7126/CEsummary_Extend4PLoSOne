<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point [ 14 , 23 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By taking this step-wise approach, we can not only induce verb classes with frequency information from a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al</a>
