VWhile the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising autoencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features
p1
aVConsequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing [ 25 ]
p2
aVMoon and Baldridge ( 2007 ) tackle the challenging problem of tagging Middle English, using techniques for projecting syntactic annotations across languages
p3
aVWe use a conditional random field tagger, choosing CRFsuite because it supports arbitrary real valued features [ 20 ] , with SGD optimization
