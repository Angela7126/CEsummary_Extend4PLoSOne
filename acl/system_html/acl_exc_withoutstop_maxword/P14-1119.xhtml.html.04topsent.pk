VAnother unsupervised approach to keyphrase extraction involves grouping the candidate keyphrases in a document into topics , such that each topic is composed of all and only those candidate keyphrases that are related to that topic [ 13 , 33 , 32 ]
p1
aVNoting that candidate keyphrases that are not semantically related to the predicted keyphrases are unlikely to be keyphrases in technical reports, Turney employs coherence features to identify such candidate keyphrases
p2
aVLike TPR, CommunityCluster gives more weight to more important topics, but unlike TPR, it extracts all candidate keyphrases from an important topic, assuming that a candidate that receives little focus in the text should still be extracted as a keyphrase as long as it is related to an important topic

aVTo score the output of a keyphrase extraction system, the typical approach, which is also adopted by the SemEval-2010 shared task on keyphrase extraction, is (1) to create a mapping between the keyphrases in
