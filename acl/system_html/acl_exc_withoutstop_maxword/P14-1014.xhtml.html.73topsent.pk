VHowever, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data
p1
aVThe averaged accuracies are calculated across the web domain data
p2
aVThis can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' of the learned WRRBM
p3
aVPrevious work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning [ 6 ] or as fixed features that are kept unchanged [ 26 , 8 ]
p4
aVWe integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger
