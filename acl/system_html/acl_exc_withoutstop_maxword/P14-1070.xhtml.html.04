<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So to sum up on the u'\u201c' labeled evaluation u'\u201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we propose to better evaluate the difficulty of combining the tasks of MWE analysis and dependency parsing by comparing our systems with systems performing simpler tasks i.e., MWE recognition without parsing, and parsing with no or limited MWE recognition, simulated by using gold MWEs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The evaluation on the labeled representation provides an evaluation of the full task (parsing, regular/irregular MWE recognition and regular MWEs structuring), with a UAS that is less impacted by errors on regular MWE status, while LAS reflects the full difficulty of</a>
