aVWhile their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u005cu2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly
p2
aVThis bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations
p3
aVWhile prior efforts in NLP have incorporated games for performing annotation and validation [ 34 , 12 , 27 ] , these games have largely been text-based, adding game-like features such as high-scores on top of an existing annotation task

aVThird, we note that both video games in the paid setting incur a fixed cost (for the prizes) and therefore additional games played can only further decrease the cost per annotation
