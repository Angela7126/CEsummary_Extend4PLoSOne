<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We tested three different approaches to generating a document u'\u2019' s VSM representation internal representations , which are based on the contents of the document, external representations , which are built using a document u'\u2019' s incoming link citation contexts (following Ritchie ( 2009 ) and He et al</a>
