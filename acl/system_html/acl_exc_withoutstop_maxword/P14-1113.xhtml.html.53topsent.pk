VA uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2
p1
aVFurthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2
p2
aVM E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b is the proposed method based on word embeddings
p3
aVHowever, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure
p4
aV3 3 www.ltp-cloud.com/download/ CilinE is organized as a hierarchy of five levels, in which the words are linked by hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations (right panel, Figure 3
p5
aVWe observe that the same property also applies to some hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p6
aVWe then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p7
aVThe same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym pairs
p8
aVAs a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities
