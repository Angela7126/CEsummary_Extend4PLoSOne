<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Due to the difficulties of re-implementing the sequence labeler without knowing the actual features set and the annotated training data, we assume all the event-related phrases are identified correctly and simply use the event trigger words annotated in the FSD corpus as k to form the event 3-tuples</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment events from tweets by aggregating information across multiple messages [ 1 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To resolve the ambiguity of the time expressions, SUTime 1 1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sutime.shtml [ 2 ] is employed, which takes text and a reference date as input and outputs a more accurate date which the time expression refers to</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this section, we first describe the Twitter corpus used in our experiments and then present how we build a baseline based on the previously proposed TwiCal system [ 14 ] , the state-of-the-art open event extraction system on tweets</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
