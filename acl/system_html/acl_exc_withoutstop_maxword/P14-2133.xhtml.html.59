<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Word embeddings are useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words, because they automatically ensure that unknown words are treated the same way as known words with similar representations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Word embeddings are useful for handling in-vocabulary words, by making it possible to pool statistics for related words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper investigates a variety of ways in which word embeddings might augment a constituency parser with a discrete state space</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This ensures that our model continues to include the original Berkeley parser model as a limiting case</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If we want to encourage similarly-embedded words to exhibit similar behavior in the generative model, we need to ensure that the are preferentially mapped onto the same latent preterminal tag</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We use the Maryland implementation of the Berkeley parser as our baseline for the kernel-smoothed lexicon, and the Maryland featured parser as our baseline for the embedding-featured lexicon</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>While word embeddings can be constructed directly from surface distributional statistics, as in LSA, more sophisticated tools for unsupervised extraction of word representations have recently gained popularity [ 3 , 10 ]</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A parser which exploited this effect could use this to acquire a robust model of name behavior by sharing statistics from all first names together, preventing low counts from producing noisy models of</a>
