VOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p1
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p2
aVThe samples were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who were instructed to regard a sample as acceptable if each event causality that constitutes it is plausible and the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent story
p3
aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
