VAs shown in Figure 3 , annotators are consistently more confident once they have consulted this information
p1
aVOn average, annotators requested additional context for 30% of comments (range across annotators of 12% to 56%
p2
aVTo this end, we introduce a variable u'\u005cu2133' i for each comment i such that u'\u005cu2133' i = 1 if y ^ i u'\u005cu2260' y i , i.e.,, u'\u005cu2133' i is an indicator variable that encodes whether or not the classifier misclassified comment i
p3
aVThis suggests that, as humans require context to make their judgements for this task, so too do computers
p4
aVFrom this contextual information, then, we can reasonably assume that the comment was intended ironically (and all three annotators did so after assessing the available contextual information
p5
aVRecall that our annotation tool allows labelers to request additional context if they cannot make a decision based on the comment text alone (Figure 1

aVReddit is a good corpus for the irony detection task in part because it provides a natural practical realization of the
