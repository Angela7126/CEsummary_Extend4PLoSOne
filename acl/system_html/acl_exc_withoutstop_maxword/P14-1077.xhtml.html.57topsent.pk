VSpecifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions
p1
aVIn contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues
p2
aVWe first train a preliminary sentence level extractor which can output confidence scores for its predictions, e.g.,, a maximum entropy or logistic regression model, and use this local extractor to produce local predictions
p3
aVAs discussed above, given a set of entity pairs and their candidate relations output by a preliminary extractor, our goal is to find an optimal configuration for all those entities pairs jointly, solving the disagreements among those candidate predictions and maximizing the overall confidence of the selected predictions
p4
aVOur framework takes a set of entity pairs and their supporting sentences as its input
p5
aVWe propose to perform joint inference upon multiple
