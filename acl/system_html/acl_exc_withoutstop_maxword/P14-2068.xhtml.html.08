<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, this prior work has not explored the linguistic basis of factuality judgments, which we show to depend on framing devices such as cue words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Saur and Pustejovsky ( 2012 ) propose a two-dimensional factuality annotation scheme, including polarity and certainty; they then build a classifier to predict annotations of factuality from statements in FactBank</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Recent work in the area of computational social science focuses on understanding credibility cues on Twitter</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given the importance of cue words as a signal for factuality, we want to assess the factuality judgments induced by each cue</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We explore the specific linguistic feature that affect factuality judgments, and compare our findings with previously-proposed groupings of factuality-related predicates</a>
