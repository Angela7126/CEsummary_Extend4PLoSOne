<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Unlike most previous work, our model is defined at a finer level of granularity u'\u2014' it computes meaning representations for individual words and is unique in its use of attributes as a means of representing the textual and visual modalities</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Unlike previous efforts such as the widely used WordSim353 collection () , our dataset contains ratings for visual and textual similarity, thus allowing to study the two modalities (and their contribution to meaning representation) together and in isolation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As our input consists of natural language attributes, the model would infer textual attributes given visual attributes and vice versa</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For that purpose, the autoencoders are pre-trained layer by layer, with the current layer being fed the latent representation of the previous autoencoder as input</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As shown in Figure 1 , our model takes as input two (real-valued) vectors representing the visual and textual modalities</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These models learn the meaning of words based on textual and perceptual input</a>
