VSince the language and translation models operate at the word level, the objective function entails that we let the models learn based on their fractional contribution of the words from the language and translation models
p1
aVThe IBM Model 1 learning process uses an internal EM approach where the E-step estimates the alignment vector for each problem word; this vector indicates the distribution of alignments of the problem word across the solution words
p2
aVAs may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' S and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N
p3
aVWe use the labels and reply-word source estimates from the E-step to re-learn the language and translation models in this step
p4
aVWe let each reply word contribute as much to the respective language and translation models according to the estimates in Section 4.3.2
p5
aVIn short, each solution word is assumed to be generated from the language model or the translation model (conditioned on the problem words) with a probability of u'\u005cu039b' and 1 - u'\u005cu039b' respectively, thus accounting for the correlation assumption
p6
aVThe language models are learnt only over the r parts of the ( p , r ) pairs since they are meant to characterize reply behavior; on the other hand, translation models learn over both p and r parts to model correlation
p7
aVThus, we estimate the proportional contribution of each word from the language and translation models too, in the E-step
p8
aVAll solution identification approaches since
