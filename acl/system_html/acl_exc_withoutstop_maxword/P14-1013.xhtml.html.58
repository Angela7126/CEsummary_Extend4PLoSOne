<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, it is important to leverage topic information to learn smarter translation models and achieve better translation performance</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, it helps to train a smarter translation model with the embedded topic information</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since the information within the sentence is insufficient for topic modeling, we first enrich sentence contexts via Information Retrieval (IR) methods using content words in the sentence as queries, so that topic-related monolingual documents can be collected</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We directly optimized bilingual topic similarity in the deep learning framework with the help of sentence-level parallel data, so that the learned representation could be easily used in SMT decoding procedure</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since a parallel sentence pair should have the same topic, our goal is to maximize the similarity score between the source sentence and target sentence</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The results confirm that topic information is indispensable for SMT since both [ 34 ] and our neural network based method significantly outperforms the baseline system</a>
