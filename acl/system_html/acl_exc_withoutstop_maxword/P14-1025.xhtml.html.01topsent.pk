VIn summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory
p1
aVWe further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u005cu2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus
p2
aVIn predominant sense acquisition, the task is to learn, for each target lemma, the most frequently occurring word sense in a particular domain or corpus, relative to a predefined sense inventory
p3
aVWe evaluated the ability of the method to learn predominant senses and induce word sense distributions, based on a broad range of datasets and two separate sense inventories
