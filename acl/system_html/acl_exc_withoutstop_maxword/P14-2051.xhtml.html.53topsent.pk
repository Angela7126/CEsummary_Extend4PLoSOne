VThe resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study
p1
aVTo answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information
p2
aVOn the reasonable assumption that the semantic contribution of the construction did not change, and therefore that all verbs ever attested in it are equally plausible from a semantic point of view, the fact that some verbs joined the distribution later than others is in want of an explanation
p3
aVThis means that productivity not only hinges on how the existing semantic space relates to the novel item, it also occurs more reliably when this relation is attested by more items
p4
aVBy comparing the plots in Figure 2 , we can follow the semantic development of the hell -construction
p5
aVOne benefit of the distributional semantics approach is that
