VIn addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types
p1
aVIn contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs
p2
aVOur work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context
p3
aVFor verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that
p4
aVTo sum up, Inst features are essential for classifying multi-label verbs, and the LingInd features provide some useful prior
p5
aVWhether or not performance is improved by adding LingInd/Dist features, with their bias towards one aspectual class, depends on the verb type
p6
aVTherefore we propose handling ambiguous verbs separately
p7
aVUsing the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the
