<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score [ 27 ] for one professional translator (P1) using the other three (P2,3,4) as a reference set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the following sections, we evaluate each of our methods by calculating BLEU scores against the same four sets of three reference translations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use translation edit rate (TER) as a measure of translation similarity</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using the raw translations without post-editing, our graph-based ranking method achieves a BLEU score of 38.89, compared to Zaidan and Callison-Burch ( 2011 ) u'\u2019' s reported score of 28.13, which they achieved using a linear feature-based classification</a>
