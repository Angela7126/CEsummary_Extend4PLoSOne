VTable 4 shows examples where the translation predicted by response-based learning ( Rebol ) differs from the gold standard reference translation, but yet leads to positive feedback via a parse that returns the correct answer from the database
p1
aVIn case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update
p2
aVLexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning
p3
aVThe key advantage of response-based learning is the possibility to receive positive feedback even from predictions that differ from gold standard reference translations, but yet receive the correct answer when parsed and matched against the database
p4
aVInstead of and in addition to learning from human reference translations, response-based learning allows to convert multiple system translations into references
p5
aVIn the following, we will present a framework that combines standard structured learning from given reference
