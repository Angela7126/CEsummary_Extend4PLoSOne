<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given the importance of cue words as a signal for factuality, we want to assess the factuality judgments induced by each cue</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Several of the cues with the lowest factuality coefficients are predicates of belief suggest , predict and think</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The cues according , report , say , and tell are strongly predictive of certainty, but the cues claim and deny convey uncertainty</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We rely on FactBank to assign the cue words to classes; the only word not covered by FactBank was sense , which we placed in predicates of perception</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, this prior work has not explored the linguistic basis of factuality</a>
