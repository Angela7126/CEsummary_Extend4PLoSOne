VThe Turker graph, G T , is an undirected graph whose edges represent u'\u005cu201c' collaboration u'\u005cu201d' Formally, let t i and t j be two translator/editor pairs; we say that pair t i u'\u005cu201c' collaborates with u'\u005cu201d' pair t j (and therefore, there is an edge between t i and t j ) if t i and t j share either a translator or an editor (or share both a translator and an editor

aVThen we incorporate the standard random walk on the Turker graph ( G T ) to include the structural information but without yet including any collaboration information; that is, we incorporate information from G T and G C without including edges linking the two together

aVSince we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score [ 27 ] for one professional translator (P1) using the other three (P2,3,4) as a reference
