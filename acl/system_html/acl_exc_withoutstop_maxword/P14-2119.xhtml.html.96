<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision is not effective since hand-labeled data will be swamped by a larger amount of distantly labeled data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast to simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision as in the previous work by Zhang et al</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>[] , we generalize the labeled data through feature selection and model this additional information directly in the latent variable approaches</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An effective approach must recognize that the hand-labeled data is more reliable than the automatically labeled data and so must take precedence in cases of conflict</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We experimentally tested alternative feature sets</a>
