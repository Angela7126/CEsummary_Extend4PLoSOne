VWe also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores

aVFor a small set of frequent, conventionalized abbreviations (e.g.,, ca for California u'\u005cu2014' 63 pairs in total u'\u005cu2014' mainly state abbreviations and similar items), we assign an fixed pair LM score, since these examples are in effect irregular cases, where the regularities of the productive abbreviation process do not capture their true cost

aVThen a small amount of annotated data is used to build models to determine whether to accept a candidate expansion of an abbreviation based on these features
