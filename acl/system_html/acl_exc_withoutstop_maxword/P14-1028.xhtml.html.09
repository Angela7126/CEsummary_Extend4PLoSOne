<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In our model, the bigram features are extracted in the window context and then the corresponding bigram embeddings are concatenated with character embeddings in Layer 1 and fed into Layer 2</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
