VThe problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data
p1
aVAs mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM

aVWe integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger

aVThis is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning
