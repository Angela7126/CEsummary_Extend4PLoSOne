VAs mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM
p1
aVUnder the output layer, the network consists of two modules the web-feature module , which incorporates knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM, and the sparse-feature module , which makes use of other POS tagging features
p2
aVWe integrate the learned WRRBM into a neural network, which serves as a scorer for POS disambiguation
p3
aVCollobert et al
p4
aVWe utilize the Word Representation RBM (WRRBM) factorization proposed by Dahl et al
p5
aVWe integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger
p6
aVWe can choose to use only the word representations of the learned WRRBM
p7
aVThe main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u005cu2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )
p8
aVThe neural network proposed in Section 3 is used for POS disambiguation by the easy-first POS tagger
p9
aVThis can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' of the learned WRRBM
p10
aVIn addition, Collobert et al
p11
aVThe web-feature module, shown in the lower left part of Figure 1, consists of a input layer and two hidden layers
p12
aVOur approach is to leverage the two sources of information in one neural network by combining them though a shared output layer, as shown in Figure 1
p13
aVFor POS tagging, we found that a simple linear layer yields satisfactory accuracies
p14
aVWhile those approaches mainly explore token-level representations (word or character embeddings), using WRRBM is able to utilize both word and n-gram representations
p15
aVThis can be achieved by also initializing the parameters of the second layer of the web-feature module using the position-dependent weight matrix and hidden bias of the learned WRRBM
p16
aV2013 ) investigate Chinese character embeddings for joint word segmentation and POS tagging
p17
aVThe second layer is a sigmoid layer to model non-linear relations between the word projections
p18
aVIn the fine-tuning phase, the parameters of the network are optimized on a set of labelled training data using guided learning
p19
aV2010 ) and Collobert et al
p20
aVSuch distribution can be easily obtained by adding a soft-max layer on top of the output layer to perform a local normalization, as done by Collobert et al
p21
aV2010 ) learn word embeddings to improve the performance of in-domain POS tagging, named entity recognition, chunking and semantic role labelling
p22
aVIn particular, Collobert et al
p23
aVUnsupervised learning is often used for training encoders that convert the input data to abstract representations (i.e., encoding vectors
p24
aVThe neural network of our baseline tagger only contains the sparse-feature module
p25
aVWe reimplemented the greedy easy-first POS tagger of Ma et al
p26
aVIn addition to labelled data, a large amount of unlabelled data on the web domain is also provided
p27
aVThe first layer is a linear projection layer, where each word in the input is projected into a D -dimensional real value vector using the projection operation described in Section 2.2
p28
aVThis may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input [ 27 ]
p29
aVSuch representations capture hidden properties of the input, and can be used as features for supervised tasks [ 3 , 20 ]
p30
aV2012), who found that using both the word embeddings and the hidden units of a tri-gram WRRBM as additional features for a CRF chunker yields larger improvements than using word embeddings only
p31
aVThis is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step
p32
aVBlitzer et al
p33
aVWe conduct experiments to test whether using the target domain data to train the WRRBM yields better performance compared with using mixed data from all sub-domains
p34
aVThe problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data
p35
aVRegarding using neural networks for sequential labelling, our approach shares similarity with that of Collobert et al
p36
aVIn particular, we both use a non-linear layer to model complex relations underling word embeddings
p37
aVYang et al
p38
aVTagging performance and lexicon coverages of each data set on the development sets are shown in Table 5
p39
aVThe web-feature and sparse-feature modules are combined by a linear output layer, as shown in the upper part of Figure 1
p40
aVWe trained 3 WRRBMs using the email domain data (RBM-E), weblog domain data (RBM-W) and mixed domain data (RBM-M), respectively, with each data set consisting of 300k sentences
p41
aVWhile the tagger of Ma et al
p42
aVZheng et al
p43
aVThe training algorithm repeats for several iterations over the training data, which is a set of sentences labelled with gold standard POS tags
p44
aVHowever, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data
p45
aVCompared with Blitzer et al
p46
aV2011 ) propose to learn representations from the mixture of both source and target domain unlabelled data to improve cross-domain sentiment classification
p47
aVExploiting useful information from the web data can be the key to improving web domain tagging
p48
aVFrom Figure 2 we can see that when knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM is incorporated, both the training strategies ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' word-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' ) improve accuracies on the source domain, which is consistent with previous findings (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011
p49
aVThe sparse-feature module, as shown in the lower right part of Figure 1, is designed to incorporate commonly-used tagging features
p50
aVIntuitively, unsupervised pre-training moves the parameters of the WRRBM towards the region where properties of the web domain data are properly modelled
p51
aVParameters of the network are trained using guided learning, where learning and search interact with each other
p52
aVCompared with the performance of the official baseline (row 4 of Table 6), which is evaluated based on the output of BerkeleyParser [ 16 , 17 ] , our baseline tagger achieves comparable accuracies on both the source and target domain data
p53
aVThe idea of learning representations from unlabelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before [ 26 , 6 , 8 ]
p54
aV2013) utilizes a linear scorer, our tagger adopts the neural network as its scorer
p55
aV2011 ) train their network by maximizing the training set likelihood, while our approach is to minimize the margin loss using guided learning
p56
aV2011 ) and Turian et al
p57
aVThe first layer of this module is a linear transformation layer, which converts the high dimensional sparse vector into a fixed-dimensional real value vector
p58
aVThe best result achieved by using a 4-gram WRRBM, ( w i - 2 , u'\u005cu2026' , w i + 1 ) , with 300 hidden units learned on 1,000k web domain sentences are shown in row 3 of Table 6
p59
aVThe input for the this module is the word n-gram ( w i - l , u'\u005cu2026' , w i + r ) , the form of which is identical to the training data of the pre-trained WRRBM
p60
aVThe idea is to project the original feature representations into low dimensional representations, which yields a high-accuracy classifier on the target domain
p61
aVTowards this end, we adopt the idea of learning representations which has been demonstrated useful in capturing hidden regularities underlying the raw input data (web text, in our case
p62
aVThe web-feature module enables us to explore the learned WRRBM in various ways
p63
aV2012 ) and Turian et al
p64
aVDepending on the specific task being considered, the output of this layer can be further fed to other non-linear layers, such as a sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent layer, to model more complex relations
p65
aVIn addition, following Dahl et al
p66
aVSecond, the web-feature module also allows us to make a comparison between whether or not to further adjust the pre-trained representation in the supervised fine-tuning phase, which corresponds to the supervised learning strategies of Turian et al
p67
aVInspired by this observation, we apply the RBM to learn feature representations from word n-grams
p68
aVThe averaged accuracies are calculated across the web domain data
p69
aVWhile previous work [ 23 , 29 , 9 ] apply guided learning to train a linear classifier by using variants of the perceptron algorithm, we are the first to combine guided learning with a neural network, by using a margin loss and a modified back-propagation algorithm
p70
aV2013 ) induce bi-lingual word embeddings for word alignment
p71
aVOn the web-domain data, shown in Figure 3 and 4, we found that leaving the learned representation unchanged ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' ) yields consistently higher performance gains
p72
aVPrevious work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning [ 6 ] or as fixed features that are kept unchanged [ 26 , 8 ]
p73
aVMost of the indicative features for POS disambiguation can be found from the words and word combinations within a local context [ 21 , 5 ]
p74
aVThe value of each unit in this layer denotes the score of the corresponding POS tag
p75
aVThe data set consists of labelled data for both the source (Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank) and target (web) domains
p76
aVTo our knowledge, we are the first to investigate guided learning for neural networks
p77
aVAlternatively, we can choose to use the hidden states of the WRRBM, which can be treated as the representations of the input n-gram
p78
aVWe choose the easy-first tagging approach since it has been demonstrated to give higher accuracies than the standard left-to-right POS tagger [ 23 , 15 ]
p79
aVThis result illustrates that the ngram-level knowledge captures more complex interactions of the web text, which cannot be recovered by using only word embeddings
p80
aVThe parameters { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1b' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1c' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( 1 ) , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( n ) } can be trained using a Metropolis-Hastings-based CD variant and the learned word representations also capture certain syntactic information; see Dahl et al
p81
aVWe can see that using the target domain data achieves similar improvements compared with using the mixed data
p82
aVExperimental results under the 4 combined settings on the development sets are illustrated in Figure 2, 3 and 4, where the x-axis denotes the size of the training data and y-axis denotes tagging accuracy
p83
aVLearning representations has been intensively studied in computer vision tasks [ 2 , 13 ]
p84
aVOur results suggest that while both strategies improve in-domain tagging accuracies, keeping the learned representation unchanged consistently results in better cross-domain accuracies
p85
aVAccuracies of the baseline tagger are shown in the upper part of Table 6
p86
aVFeature templates are shown in Table 3, which are based on those of Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Shen et al
p87
aVIn this section, we give some background on RBMs and then show how they can be used to learn representations of the web text
p88
aVIn addition, while Titov ( 2011 ) and Glorot et al
p89
aVSimilar result was reported by Dahl et al
p90
aVThe new representations are induced based on the auxiliary tasks defined on unlabelled data together with a dimensionality reduction technique
p91
aVIn addition, different from Le Roux et al
p92
aVHere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc0c' w 1 denotes the parameters of the first layer of the web-feature module, which is a D ×
p93
aVNote that one can stack standard RBMs on top of a WRRBM to construct a Deep Belief Network (DBN
p94
aVThe basic idea is to share word representations across different positions in the input n-gram while using position-dependent weights to distinguish between different word orders
p95
aVThe results suggest that using mixed data can achieve almost as good performance as using the target sub-domain data, while using mixed data yields a much more robust tagger across all sub-domains
p96
aVWe use this baseline to examine the performance of a tagger trained purely on the source domain
p97
aVOur model captures such a dependency in a discriminative manner, by just adding tag-related features to the sparse-feature module
p98
aVTitov ( 2011 ) and Glorot et al
p99
aVThe algorithm proposed here belongs to a general framework named guided learning , where search and learning interact with each other
p100
aVRather than tagging a sentence from left to right, easy-first tagging is based on a deterministic process, repeatedly selecting the easiest word to tag
p101
aVIn addition, adjusting the learned representation or keeping them fixed does not result in too much difference in tagging accuracies
p102
aVIn such cases, it might be desirable to train WRRBM using data only on that domain
p103
aVWe trained the WRRBM on web-domain data of different sizes (number of sentences
p104
aVHowever, state-of-the-art POS taggers in the literature [ 5 , 23 ] are mainly optimized on the the Penn Treebank (PTB), and when shifted to web data, tagging accuracies drop significantly [ 18 ]
p105
aVIn each case, there can be two different training strategies depending on whether the learned representations are further adjusted or kept unchanged during the fine-turning phrase
p106
aVFor each position j , there is a weight matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( j ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H × D , which is used to model the interaction between the hidden layer and the word projection in position j
p107
aVIn the pre-training phase, we learn an encoder that converts the web text into an intermediate representation, which acts as useful features for prediction tasks
p108
aVWhile most previous work focus on in-domain sequential labelling or cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to learn representations for web-domain structured prediction
p109
aVWith data preprocessing, the average accuracy boosts to about 92.02 on the test set of the target domain
p110
aV2006 ) propose to induce shared representations for domain adaptation, which is based on the alternating structure optimization (ASO) method of Ando and Zhang ( 2005
p111
aVIn some circumstances, probability distribution over POS tags might be a more preferable form of output
p112
aVBy adopting greedy layer-wise training [ 10 , 2 ] , DBNs are capable of modelling higher order non-linear relations between the input, and has been demonstrated to improve performance for many computer vision tasks [ 10 , 2 , 13 ]
p113
aVAnalysing and extracting useful information from the web has become an increasingly important research direction for the NLP community, where many tasks require part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a fundamental preprocessing step
p114
aVPseudo-code of easy-first tagging is shown in Algorithm 1
p115
aVFirst, it allows us to investigate knowledge from the WRRBM incrementally
p116
aVWe can see that the improvement of using word representations mainly comes from better accuracy of out-of-vocabulary (oov) words
p117
aVWe conduct experiments on the official data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task [ 18 ]
p118
aVAt each step, the algorithm adopts a scorer, the neural network in our case, to assign a score to each possible word-tag pair ( w , t ) , and then selects the highest score one ( w ^ , t ^ ) to tag (i.e.,, tag w ^ with t ^
p119
aVThe learned model preserves the property of preferring to tag easy words first
p120
aVSuch auxiliary tasks can be specific to the supervised task
p121
aV2011 ) use the learned representation to improve cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to apply it to cross-domain structured prediction

aVL projection matrix
p123
aVFinally, more detailed accuracies under the 4 settings on the email domain are shown in Table 4
p124
aVMoreover, we achieve the highest tagging accuracy reported so far on this data set, surpassing those achieved using parser combinations based on self-training [ 24 , 12 ]
p125
aVIn some circumstances, we may know beforehand that the target domain data belongs to a certain sub-domain, such as the email domain
p126
aVIn particular, their regularizer aims to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between the marginal distributions of the learned representations on the source and target domains
p127
aVIn each iteration, the procedure shown in Algorithm 2 is applied to each sentence in the training set
p128
aV2006 ) , the advantage of using RBMs is that it learns representations in a pure unsupervised manner, which is much simpler
p129
aVParticipants are not allowed to use web-domain labelled data for training
p130
aVAmong the many proposed encoders, we choose the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been successfully used in many tasks [ 14 , 10 ]
p131
aVAt each step during the processing of a training example, the algorithm calculates a margin loss based on two word-tag pairs ( w ¯ , t ¯ ) and ( w ^ , t ^ ) (line 4 u'\u005cu223c' line 6 w ¯ , t ¯ ) denotes the word-tag pair that has the highest model score among those that are inconsistent with the gold standard, while ( w ^ , t ^ ) denotes the one that has the highest model score among those that are consistent with the gold standard
p132
aVOur experiments are conducted on the data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task, which aims at building a single robust syntactic analysis system across the web-domain
p133
aVThe web domain data can be further classified into five sub-domains, including emails, weblogs, business reviews, news groups and Yahoo!Answers
p134
aVSuch high dimensional input gives rise to high computational cost and it is not clear whether those approaches can be applied to large scale unlabelled data, with hundreds of millions of training examples
p135
aVFor each data set, we investigate an extensive set of combinations of hyper-parameters the n-gram window ( l , r ) in { ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) } ; the hidden layer size in { 200 , 300 , 400 } ; the learning rate in { 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 }
p136
aVThis is because the standard loss is calculated based on a unique input vector
p137
aVStatistics about labelled and unlabelled data are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively
p138
aVPerformance of the top 2 systems of the SANCL 2012 task are also shown in Table 6
p139
aVOur method learns representations from only word n-grams with n ranging from 3 to 5, which can be easily applied to large scale-data
p140
aVTheir work differs from ours in that their approaches learn representations from the feature vectors for sentiment classification, which might be of thousands of dimensions
p141
aVThe raw web domain data contains much noise, including spelling error, emotions and inconsistent capitalization
p142
aVFollowing some participants [ 12 ] , we conduct simple preprocessing steps to the input of the development and the test sets 2 2 The preprocessing steps make use of no POS knowledge, and does not bring any unfair advantages to the participants
p143
aVIf the loss is zero, the algorithm continues to process the next untagged word
p144
aVTherefore, a better idea is to keep the representation unchanged so that we can learn a function that maps the general web-text properties to its syntactic categories
p145
aVWhile in our case, each visible variable corresponds to a word, which may take on tens-of-thousands of different values
p146
aVThe data sets are generated by first concatenating all the cleaned unlabelled data, then selecting sentences evenly across the concatenated file
p147
aV2011 ) model the dependency between neighbouring tags in a generative manner, by employing a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j
p148
aVThe input for this module is a vector of boolean values u'\u005cu03a6' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f k u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) ) , where x denotes the partially tagged input sentence and f i u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) denotes a feature function, which returns 1 if the corresponding feature fires and 0 otherwise
p149
aVThe affine form of E with respect to u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc21' implies that the visible variables are conditionally independent with each other given the hidden layer units, and vice versa
p150
aVHowever, for the email domain, RBM-W yields much smaller improvement compared with RBM-E, and vice versa
p151
aVWe apply the same preprocessing steps to all the unlabelled data
p152
aVTraining the score involves a forward process of complexity O u'\u005cu2062' ( n u'\u005cu2062' T 2 ) , where T denotes the number of tags
p153
aVBy contrast, using n-gram representations improves the performance on both oov and non-oov
p154
aVNote that the visible units of RBMs are binary
p155
aVThis yields the conditional distribution
p156
aVAs pointed out by Plank ( 2009 ) , for many NLP tasks, defining the auxiliary tasks is a non-trivial engineering problem
p157
aVOur greedy tagger achieves 93.27 u'\u005cu2062' % tagging accuracy, which is significantly better than the baseline u'\u005cu2019' s 92.02 u'\u005cu2062' % accuracy ( p 0.05 by McNemar u'\u005cu2019' s test
p158
aVOur method achieves a 93.27 u'\u005cu2062' % average accuracy across the web-domain, which is the best result reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers

p163
aVFrom Figures 2, 3 and 4, we can see that adopting the ngram-level representation consistently achieves better performance compared with using word representations only ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' word-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-adjusted u'\u005cu201d'

aVMore specifically, given the i t u'\u005cu2062' h word w i of a sentence, we apply RBMs to model the joint distribution of the n-gram ( w i - l , u'\u005cu22ef' , w i + r ) , where l and r denote the left and right window, respectively
p167
aVThe tagging accuracy is defined as the percentage of words (punctuations included) that are correctly tagged
p168
aVHowever, our network differs from theirs in the following aspects
p169
aVThis condition does not hold in our case, because w ^ and w ¯ may refer to different words, which means that the margin loss in line 6 of Algorithm 2 is calculated based on two different input vectors, denoted by u'\u005cu27e8' w ^ u'\u005cu27e9' and u'\u005cu27e8' w ¯ u'\u005cu27e9' , respectively
