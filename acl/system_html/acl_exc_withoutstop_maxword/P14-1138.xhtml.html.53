<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Table 4 demonstrates that the proposed RNN-based model outperforms I u'\u2062' B u'\u2062' M u'\u2062' 4 trained from the unlabeled 40 K data by employing either the 1 K labeled data or the 9 K unlabeled data, which is less than 25% of the training data for I u'\u2062' B u'\u2062' M u'\u2062' 4</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As an instance of discriminative models, we describe an FFNN-based word alignment model [ 40 ] , which is our baseline</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, the RNN-based model has less effect on French-English word alignment than Japanese-English word alignment, as indicated in Table 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that the development data was not used in the alignment tasks, i.e.,, B u'\u2062' T u'\u2062' E u'\u2062' C and H u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' s u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' d u'\u2062' s , because the hyperparameters of the alignment models were set by preliminary small-scale experiments</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that R u'\u2062' N u'\u2062' N s + c u'\u2062' ( R ) cannot be trained from the 40 K data because the 40 K data does not have gold standard word alignments</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that alignments in the FFNN-based model are also governed by first-order Markov dynamics because an alignment score depends on</a>
