<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE u'\u2019' s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the u'\u201c' teacher u'\u201d' for semi-supervised back-propagation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Next, we adapt and extend some original phrase features as the input features for DAE feature learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence [ Hinton2002 ] , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, although we have introduced another four types of phrase features ( X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 ), the only 16 features in X are a bottleneck for learning large hidden layers feature representation, because it has limited information, the performance of the high-dimensional DAE features which are directly learned from single DAE is not very satisfactory</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Second, it only uses the unsupervised layer-wise pre-training of DBN built with stacked sets of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) [ Hinton2002 ] , does not have a training objective, so its performance relies on the empirical parameters</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To learn high-dimensional feature representation and to further improve the performance, we introduce a natural horizontal composition for DAEs that can be used to create large hidden layer representations simply by horizontally combining two (or more) DAEs [ Baldi2012 ] , as shown in Figure 3</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Compared with the unsupervised DBN features, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective and stable</a>
