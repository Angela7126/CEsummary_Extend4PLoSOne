VSegmentation accuracy is reported as an F1-score of unlabeled segment bracketing
p1
aVFinally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser
p2
aVA unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node
p3
aVAfter applying such a transform to a treebank, we can induce grammars and modify parsing to search as needed to recover just these constituents
p4
aVWe use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing
p5
aVOur task is to learn which words can begin ( B ) a hedge constituent
p6
aVIt is possible to parse with a standardly induced PCFG using this sort of hedge constrained parsing that only considers a subset of the chart cells, and speedups are achieved, however this is clearly non-optimal, since the model is ill-suited to combining hedges into flat structures at the root of the tree
p7
aVSpace constraints preclude inclusion of trials with this method, but the net result is a severe degradation in accuracy (tens of points of F-measure) versus standard parsing
p8
aVThis property enables us to chunk the sentence into segments that correspond to complete hedges, and parse the segments independently (and simultaneously) instead of parsing the entire sentence
p9
aVFirst, we present the simple
