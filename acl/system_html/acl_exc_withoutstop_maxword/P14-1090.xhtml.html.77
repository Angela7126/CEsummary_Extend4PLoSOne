<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These properties, along with the sibling relationship to the topic node, are important cues for answering the question</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We define answer node as the node that is the answer and answer relation as the relation from the answer node to its direct parent</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given a topic, we selectively roll out the Freebase graph by choosing those nodes within a few hops of relationship to the topic node , and form a topic graph</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We combine question features and Freebase features (per node) by doing a pairwise concatenation</a>
