<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>\newcite Sun:2010:COLING details their respective theoretical strengths character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new oov words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate</a>
