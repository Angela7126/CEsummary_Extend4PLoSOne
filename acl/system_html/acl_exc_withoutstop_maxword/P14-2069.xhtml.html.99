<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>These domain-specific words are mostly not included in any other existing general-purpose emotion lexicons</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully construct a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for this corpus that is able to understand the connotation of the words that may not be obvious without the context</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For each emotion category, we evaluates it as a binary classification problem</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the evaluation of emotion lexicons, the binary classification is performed in a very simple way</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Usually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Lastly, previous emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on many manually constructed resources (e.g.,, emotion lexicon, parsers, etc</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, the word is considered neutral and not included in the emotion dictionary</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Hence, the topics consequently group semantically</a>
