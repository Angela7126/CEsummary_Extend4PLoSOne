<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This AMT annotated dataset was used as the low quality dataset D ^ in our evaluation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The latter option is appealing since it creates a large annotated dataset at low cost</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Active learning for data cleaning differs from traditional active learning because the data already has low quality labels</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After that, the same dataset was annotated independently by a group of expert annotators to create the ground truth</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Due to these reasons, there is a lack of sufficient and high quality labeled data for emotion research</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It demonstrates the challenge of annotation by crowdsourcing</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For the experimental purpose, the re-annotation was done by assigning the ground truth labels to the selected instances</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We consider emotion analysis as an interesting and challenging problem domain of this study, and conduct comprehensive experiments on Twitter data</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>With the proposed algorithm, the active learner becomes more accurate and resistant to label noise, thus the mislabeled data points can be more easily and accurately identified</a>
