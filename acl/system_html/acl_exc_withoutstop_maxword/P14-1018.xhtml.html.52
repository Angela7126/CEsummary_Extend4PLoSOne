<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Such extreme divergences in the amount of time required for classification across all graphs should be of strong interest to researchers concerned with latent attribute prediction tasks because Twitter users produce messages with extremely different frequencies</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Figure 3 demonstrates that more tweets during prediction time lead to higher accuracy by showing that more users with 100 tweets are correctly classified e.g.,, filled green markers in the right upper quadrant are true Republicans and in the left lower quadrant are true Democrats</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, we propose streaming models for personal analytics that dynamically update user labels based on their stream of communications which has been addressed previously by Van Durme ( 2012b</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Other methods characterize Twitter users by applying limited amounts of network structure information in addition to lexical features</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These results follow naturally from the underlying feature representation having more tweets per user leads to a lower variance estimate of a target multinomial distribution</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We rely on straightforward Bayesian rule update to our batch models in order to simulate a real-time streaming prediction scenario as a first step beyond the existing models as shown in Figure 2</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We represent p u'\u039c' ( R u'\u2223' T ) as a box and whisker plot with the median, lower and upper quantiles to show the variance; the length of whiskers indicate lower and upper extreme values</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We prefer binary to normalized count-based features to overcome sparsity issues caused by making predictions on each tweet individually</a>
