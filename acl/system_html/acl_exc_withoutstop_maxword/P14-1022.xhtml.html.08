<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Recall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar, what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u2062' ( r</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Subsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For rule abstractions, we use two templates the parent of the rule and the identity of the rule</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>All of these past CRF parsers do also exploit span features, as did the structured margin parser of Taskar et al</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Adding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser u'\u2019' s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1</a>
