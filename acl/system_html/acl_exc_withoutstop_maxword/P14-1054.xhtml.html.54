<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u201c' soft constraint u'\u201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In consideration of the Chinese characteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because we are interested in the 6 annotated major relation types and the 18 subtypes, we average the results of five runs on the 6 positive relation types (and 18 subtypes) as the final performance</a>
