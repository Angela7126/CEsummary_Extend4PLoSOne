VInstead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu0391' [] and tree edit distance
p1
aVIn this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu0391' and tree edit distance
p2
aVLAS order the corpora NDT 3, 2, 1, CDT da, en, it, es, PCEDT, whereas u'\u005cu0391' d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' f and u'\u005cu0391' n u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' m gives the order NDT 2, 1, 3, PCEDT, CDT da, en, it, es, and u'\u005cu0391' p u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n gives the same order as the other alphas but with CDT es and it changing places
p3
aVThese metrics express agreement on a nominal coding task as the ratio u'\u005cu039a' , u'\u005cu03a0' = A o - A e / 1 - A e where A o is the observed agreement and A e the expected agreement according to some model of u'\u005cu201c' random u'\u005cu201d' annotation
p4
aVTherefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets
p5
aVThe idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by \u005cciteN Fournier13
p6
aVThe data studied in this work has previously been used by \u005cciteN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures
p7
aVThe u'\u005cu0394' d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' f function causes an extreme shift of the distances towards 0; more than 30% of the sentence pairs have distance 0, 1, or 2, which causes D e d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' f to be extremely low and thus gives disproportionally large weight to non-zero distances in D o d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' f
p8
aVMean LAS at p r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' h = 1 of Figure 5 is 23.9%, clearly much higher than we would expect if the trees were completely random
p9
aVNext, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work
p10
aVA method for perturbing phrase structure trees would also be interesting, as this would allow us to repeat
