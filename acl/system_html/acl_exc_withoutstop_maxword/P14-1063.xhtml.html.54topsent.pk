VThis is because the weight tensors learned by T-MIRA are highly structured, which significantly reduces model/training complexity and makes the learning process very effective in a low-resource environment, but as the amount of data increases, the more complex and expressive vector-based models adapt to the data better, whereas further improvements from the tensor model is impeded by its structural constraints, making it insensitive to the increase of training data

aVIn general, if V features are defined for a learning problem, and we (i) organize the feature set as a tensor u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudebd' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n 1 × n 2 × u'\u005cu2026' u'\u005cu2062' n D and (ii) use H component rank-1 tensors to approximate the corresponding target weight tensor

aVA linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors
p3
aVAs mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u005cu201c' design freedom u'\u005cu201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one

aVThis also makes training the model parameters a challenging problem, since the amount of labeled training data is usually small compared to the size of feature sets the feature weights cannot be
