<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Results are listed in Table 1, where row 2 and row 3 list the UAS of words (all excluding punctuations) on the development and test set, respectively</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To see this, we evaluate the parsing accuracies of the selected parsers on words and punctuations, separately</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Before parsing starts and after the preprocessing step for paired punctuations, our method employs a second preprocessing step to attach non-paired punctuations to their left neighbouring words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In our method, punctuations are treated as properties of its neighbouring words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this method, punctuations are not associated with lexical heads, but are treated as properties of their neighbouring words</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Before parsing starts, a preprocessing step is used to first attach the paired punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words,</a>
