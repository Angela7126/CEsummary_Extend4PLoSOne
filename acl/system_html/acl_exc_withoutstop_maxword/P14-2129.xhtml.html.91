<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Segmentation accuracy is reported as an F1-score of unlabeled segment bracketing</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that segmentation time is negligible compared to the parsing time, hence is omitted in reported time</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We ran timing tests on an Intel 2.66GHz processor with 3MB of cache and 2GB of memory</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Segmentation accuracy is better for the model with labels, although overall that accuracy is rather low</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The final two rows show performance with automatic segmentation, using a model that includes either unlabeled or labeled segmentation tags, as described in the last section</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Figure 2 plots the percentage of constituents from the original WSJ Penn treebank (sections 2-21) retained in the transformed version, as we vary the maximum span length parameter L</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Keep in mind that the number of reference constituents increases as L increases, hence both precision and recall can decrease as the parameter grows</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If we apply this transform to an entire treebank, we can use the transformed trees to induce a PCFG for parsing</a>
