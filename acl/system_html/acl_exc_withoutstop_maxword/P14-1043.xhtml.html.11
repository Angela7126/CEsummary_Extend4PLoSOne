<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The other difference is where the preposition phrase (PP) u'\u201c' in the park u'\u201d' should be attached, which is also known as the PP attachment problem, a notorious challenge for parsing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Training with the combined labeled and unlabeled data, the objective is to maximize the mixed likelihood</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this work, we adopt the graph-based paradigm because it allows us to naturally derive conditional probability of a dependency tree u'\ud835' u'\udc1d' given a sentence u'\ud835' u'\udc31' , which is required to compute likelihood of</a>
