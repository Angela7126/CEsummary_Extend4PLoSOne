VAs mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u005cu201c' design freedom u'\u005cu201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one
p1
aVA linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors
p2
aVThis also makes training the model parameters a challenging problem, since the amount of labeled training data is usually small compared to the size of feature sets the feature weights cannot be estimated reliably
p3
aVMost traditional models are linear models, in the sense that both the features of the data and model parameters are represented as vectors in a vector space
p4
aVThe linear tensor model is illustrated in Figure 1
p5
aVSo what is the advantage of learning with a tensor model instead of a vector model
p6
aVSpecifically, a vector space model assumes each feature weight to be a u'\u005cu201c' free u'\u005cu201d' parameter, and estimating them reliably could therefore be hard when training data are not sufficient or the feature set is huge
p7
aVSuch models require learning individual feature weights directly, so that the number of parameters to be estimated is identical to the size of the feature set
p8
aVHowever if
