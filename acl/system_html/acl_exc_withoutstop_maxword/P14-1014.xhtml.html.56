<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u2019' s discriminative</a>
