VThus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text
p1
aVThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p2
aVFor example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u005cu201c' derailment of train u'\u005cu201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u005cu201c' crash of train u'\u005cu201d'
p3
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p4
aVSince our task and dataset are novel, there is no direct baseline with which we can compare this result
p5
aVThis section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset
p6
aVAnother case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI
p7
aVOn the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems
p8
aVThe high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems
p9
aVMore concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis
p10
aVThen, a human reader annotates each instance as u'\u005cu201c' Yes u'\u005cu201d' u'\u005cu2013' meaning that the implied relationship indeed holds in the Text, or u'\u005cu201c' No u'\u005cu201d' otherwise
