VUsually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification
p1
aVWe descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output
p2
aVOur approach is a weakly supervised approach since only some seeds emotion sentiment words are needed to lanch the process of lexicon construction
p3
aVThe proposed EaLDA model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] model by employing a small set of seeds to guide the model generating topics
p4
aVLastly, previous emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on many manually constructed resources (e.g.,, emotion lexicon, parsers, etc
p5
aVThe experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully construct a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for this corpus that is able to understand the connotation of the words that may not be obvious without the context
p6
aVFor each word in the document, we decide whether its
