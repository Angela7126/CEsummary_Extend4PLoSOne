VCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p1
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p2
aVAs is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is used to assign a model score to each derivation
