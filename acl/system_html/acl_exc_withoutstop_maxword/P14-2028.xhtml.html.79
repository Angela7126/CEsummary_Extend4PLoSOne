<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following given query q , pick c = arg max c E P ( c E q ) as a correction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method</a>
