VMany languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT
p1
aVTo this end, we model bilingual UWS under a similar framework with monolingual UWS in order to improve efficiency, and replace Gibbs sampling with expectation maximization (EM) in training
p2
aVIn contrast, UWS, spurred by the findings that infants are able to use statistical cues to determine word boundaries [] , relies on statistical criteria instead of manually crafted standards
p3
aVThough supervised-learning approaches which involve training segmenters on manually segmented corpora are widely used [] , yet the criteria for manually annotating words are arbitrary, and the available annotated corpora are limited in both quantity and genre variety
p4
aVThe SIGHAN-MSR corpus [] consists of manually segmented simplified Chinese news text, released in the SIGHAN bakeoff 2005 shared tasks
p5
aVFor example, in machine translation, there are various parallel corpora such as BTEC for tourism-related dialogues [] and PatentMT in the patent domain [] 1 1 http://ntcir.nii.ac.jp/PatentMT , but researchers working on Chinese-related tasks often use the Stanford Chinese segmenter [] which is trained on a small amount of annotated news text
p6
aVUWS learns from unsegmented raw text, which are available in large quantities, and thus it has the potential to provide more accurate and adaptive segmentation than supervised approaches with less development effort being required
p7
aVThe approaches of explicitly modeling the probability of words [] significantly outperformed a heuristic approach [] on the monolingual Chinese SIGHAN-MSR corpus [] , which inspired the work of this paper
p8
aVFor the bilingual tasks, the publicly available system of Moses [] with default settings is employed to perform machine translation, and BLEU [] was used to evaluate the quality
p9
aVIn this section, the proposed method is first validated on monolingual segmentation tasks, and then evaluated in the context of SMT to study whether the translation quality, measured by BLEU, can be improved
p10
aVWe removed the United Nations corpus and the traditional Chinese data sets from the constraint training resources
p11
aVimprovement of BLEU scores compared to supervised Stanford Chinese word segmenter
p12
aVThe training set consists of 1 million parallel sentences extracted from patent documents, and the development set and test set both consist of 2000 sentences
p13
aVIn practical applications, the size of the corpus is fixed, and we found empirically that the number of iterations required by the proposed method for convergence is usually small (less than five iterations
p14
aVThe proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested
p15
aVThese variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS
p16
aVThe experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus
p17
aVIt was set to 3 for the monolingual unigram model, and 2 for the bilingual unigram model, which provided slightly higher BLEU scores on the development set than the other settings
p18
aVFor UWS, the hidden variables are indicators that identify substrings of sentences in the corpus as words
p19
aVThe CTB and PKU Stanford segmenter were both trained on annotated news text, which was the major domain of OpenMT06
p20
aVThe computational complexity of our method is linear in the number of iterations, the size of the corpus, and the complexity of calculating the expectations on each sentence or sentence pair
p21
aVUWS learns models by maximizing the likelihood of the unsegmented corpus, formulated as
p22
aVFor the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than that of the monolingual unigram model, as the states at specific position of F are not only related to the length of the current word, but also related to the length of the word before it
p23
aVFor bilingual segmentation,the size of the alignment window is set to 6 ; the probability u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu03a6' of foreign language words being generated by an empty English word, was set to 0.3
p24
aVwhere K is the number of characters in u'\u005cu2131' , and the k -th character is the start of the word f j , since j and J are unknown during the computation of dynamic programming u'\u005cu0394' b is the window size, u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu03a6' is the prior probability of an empty English word, and u'\u005cu03a3' ensures all the items sum to 1
p25
aV[] used the local best alignment to increase the speed of the Gibbs sampling in training but the impact on accuracy was not explored
p26
aVHowever, bilingual approaches that model word probabilities suffer from computational complexity
p27
aVTable 5 presents the run times of the proposed methods on the bilingual corpora
p28
aVExclude the previous expected counts of the current sentence (pair) from the model, and then derive the current sentence in all possible ways, calculating the new expected counts for the words (see Section 2.1 ), that is, we calculate the expected probabilities of the u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' being words given the data excluding u'\u005cu2131' , i.e., u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc04' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3d' / { u'\u005cu2131' } ( P ( u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2131' ) ) = P ( u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2131' , u'\u005cu2133' ) in a similar manner to the marginalization in the Gibbs sampling process which we are replacing;
p29
aVThe time cost of the bilingual models is about 5 times that of the monolingual model, which is consistent with the complexity analysis in Section 3
p30
aVIn monolingual segmentation, the proposed methods with both unigram and bigram models were tested
p31
aVCharacter-based segmentation, LDC segmenter and Stanford Chinese segmenters were used as the baseline methods
p32
aVThe results reported in related papers are listed for comparison
p33
aVThis section describes our unified monolingual and bilingual UWS scheme
p34
aVIn order to maintain both speed and accuracy, the following window function is adopted
p35
aVThis section uses a unigram model for description convenience, but the method can be extended to n -gram models
p36
aVThe set u'\u005cu2131' is chosen to represent an unsegmented foreign language sentence (a sequence of characters), because an unsegmented sentence can be seen as the set of all possible segmentations of the sentence denoted F , i.e., F u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu2131'
p37
aV5 ; the complexity is linear in the length of sentences and the square of the predefined maximum length of words
p38
aVFor the monolingual tasks, the F 1 score against the gold annotation is adopted to measure the accuracy
p39
aVNote that the comparison of speed is only for reference because the times are obtained from their respective papers
p40
aV[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data
p41
aVFor the PYP model, the base distribution adopts the formula in [] , and the strength parameter is set to 1.0 , and the discount is set to 1.0 × 10 - 6
p42
aVThe training was started from assuming that there was no previous segmentations on each sentence (pair), and the number of iterations was fixed
p43
aVThe monolingual bigram model, however, was slower to converge, so we started it from the segmentations of the unigram model, and using 10 iterations
p44
aVExperimental results show that they are competitive to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and speed (Table LABEL:tab:mono:acc
p45
aVOur method of learning u'\u005cu2133' and u'\u005cu212c' proceeds in a similar manner to the EM algorithm
p46
aVThen, the previous dynamic programming method can be extended to the bilingual expectation

p54
aVHowever, VB requires formulating the m expectations of ( m - 1 ) -dimensional marginal distributions, where m is the number of hidden variables
p55
aVThis data set mainly consists of news text 3 3 It also contains a small number of web blogs
p56
aVTherefore, we have not explored VB methods in this paper, but we do show that our method is superior to the existing methods
