<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, they decomposed the problem of text-level discourse parsing into two stages intra-sentential parsing to produce a discourse tree for each sentence, followed by multi-sentential parsing to combine the sentence-level discourse trees and produce the text-level discourse tree</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, as an optimal discourse parser, Joty et al u'\u2019' s model is highly inefficient in practice, with respect to both their DCRF-based local classifiers, and their CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, unlike the structure model, adjacent relation nodes do not share discourse constituents on the first layer</a>
