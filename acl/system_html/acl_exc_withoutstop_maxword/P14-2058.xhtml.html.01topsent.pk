VBased on the results obtained by , who showed that the keyword method results in better long-term word retention than rote memorization, we would expect the error rate reduction to be even higher in a delayed post-test
p1
aVInterestingly, there is a strong correlation (Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s r = 0.85 ) between the difficulty of the words in each group (measured as the error rate on rote memorization) and the positive contribution of the generated sentences to the learning process
p2
aVThe effectiveness of the keyword method (KM) is a well-established fact [] found that using KM to teach French made learning easier and faster than conventional methods compared the effectiveness of three learning methods including the semantic mapping, rote memorization (i.e.,, memorization by pure repetition, with no mnemonic aid) and keyword on beginner learners of a second language
p3
aV1) Keywords with a smaller orthographic/phonetic distance are preferred; 2) Keywords consisting of a single word are preferred over two words
