VMWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE
p1
aVRegular MWEs appear with u'\u005cu2019' structured u'\u005cu2019' syntax we modify the tree structure to recover the regular syntactic dependencies
p2
aVSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs
p3
aVIRREG-BY-PARSER the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2

aVThe evaluation on u'\u005cu201c' structured representation u'\u005cu201d' can be interpreted as an
