VThe proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested
p1
aVThese variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS
p2
aVThe monolingual bigram model, however, was slower to converge, so we started it from the segmentations of the unigram model, and using 10 iterations
p3
aVThus its complexity is U 2 times the unigram model u'\u005cu2019' s complexity
p4
aVThe experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus
p5
aV[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data
p6
aVFor the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than that of the monolingual unigram model, as the states at specific position of F are not only related to the length of the current word, but also related to the
