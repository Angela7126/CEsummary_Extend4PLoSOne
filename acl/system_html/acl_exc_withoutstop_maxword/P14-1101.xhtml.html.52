<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The TLD model retains the IGMM vowel phone component, but extends the lexicon of the LD model by adding topic-specific lexicons, which capture the notion that lexeme probabilities are topic-dependent</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, due to a widespread assumption that infants do not know the meanings of many words at the age when they are learning phonetic categories (see 42 for a review), most recent models of early phonetic category acquisition have explored the phonetic learning problem in the absence of semantic information ( 8 ; 9 ; 11 ; 26 ; 50 )</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We therefore obtain the topic distributions used as input to the TLD model by training an LDA topic model ( 5 ) on a superset of the child-directed transcript data we use for lexical-phonetic learning, dividing the transcripts into small sections (the u'\u2018' documents u'\u2019' in LDA) that serve as our distinct situations u'\ud835' u'\udc89'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A purely distributional learner who observes a cluster of data points in the ae - eh region is likely to assume all these points belong to a single category because the distributions of the categories are so similar</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The topic-word distributions learned by LDA are discarded, since these are based on the (correct and unambiguous) words in the transcript, whereas the TLD model is presented with phonetically ambiguous versions of these word tokens and must learn to disambiguate them and associate them with topics</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In theory, semantic information could offer a valuable cue for phoneme induction 1 1 The models in this paper do not distinguish between phonetic and phonemic categories, since they do not capture phonological processes (and there are also none present in our synthetic data</a>
