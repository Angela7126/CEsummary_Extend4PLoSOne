<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We chose the balanced corpora where the standard approach has shown the best results in the previous experiment, namely [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] and [ diabetes corpus 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then apply the resulting regression function to each word co-occurrence count as a pre-processing step of the standard approach</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilingual corpora was initially addressed by using parallel corpora (i.e., a corpus that contains source texts</a>
