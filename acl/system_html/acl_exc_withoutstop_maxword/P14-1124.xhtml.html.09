<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first illustration of word burstiness can be seen by plotting observed inverse document frequency, IDF w , versus f w in the log domain (Figure 7</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the Tagalog conversations, as with English newswire, we observe that the document frequency, DF w , of a word w is not a linear function of word frequency f w in the log domain, as would be expected under a naive Poisson generative assumption</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the AP newswire, Church and Gale found the largest deviation between the predicted IDF w ^ and observed IDF w to occur in the middle of the frequency range</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Looking close to the y -axis in Figure 9 , we observe a second class of exclusively low frequency words whose burstiness ranges from highly concentrated to singletons</a>
