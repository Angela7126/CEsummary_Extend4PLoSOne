<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We tested all three methods on the u'\u201d' common u'\u201d' dataset as well to evaluate if our handling of hard cases affects the performance of our approach on the common cases of spelling error</a>
