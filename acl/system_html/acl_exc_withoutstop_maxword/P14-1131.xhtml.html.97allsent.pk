VCoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u005cu2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes
p1
aVFor lexicon extraction, we use the same parameters as in the synonym extraction task for all four similarity measures
p2
aVWe propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph
p3
aVOur key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step
p4
aVSimRank is at a disadvantage because it computes all similarities in the graph regardless of the size of the test set; it is particularly inefficient on synonym extraction because the English graph contains a large number of edges (see Table 1
p5
aVApart from SimRank, extensions of PageRank are the main methods for computing the similarity of nodes in graphs in NLP (e.g.,, Hughes and Ramage ( 2007 ) , Agirre et al
p6
aVLater on, we will give a matrix formulation to compare CoSimRank with SimRank
p7
aVThe extension of CoSimRank to similarity across graphs is important for the application of bilingual lexicon extraction given a set of correspondences between nodes in two graphs A and B (corresponding to two different languages), a pair of nodes ( a u'\u005cu2208' A , b u'\u005cu2208' B ) is a good candidate for a translation pair if their node similarity is high
p8
aVIn summary, CoSimRank and SimRank have similar space and time complexities for computing all n 2 similarities
p9
aVThus, we have reduced SimRank u'\u005cu2019' s cubic time complexity to a quadratic time complexity for CoSimRank or u'\u005cu2013' assuming that the average degree d does not depend on n u'\u005cu2013' SimRank u'\u005cu2019' s quadratic time complexity to linear time complexity for the case of computing few similarities
p10
aVThis effect is only visible on the larger test set (lexicon extraction) because the general computation overhead is about the same on a smaller test set
p11
aVFor the more typical case that we only want to compute a fraction of all similarities, we have recast the global SimRank formulation as a local CoSimRank formulation
p12
aVWe first first give an intuitive introduction of CoSimRank as a Personalized PageRank (PPR) derivative
p13
aVThe use of weighted edges was first proposed in the PageRank patent
p14
aVSimRank is based on the simple intuition that nodes in a graph should be considered as similar to the extent that their neighbors are similar
p15
aVWe will show now that the basic CoSimRank algorithm can be extended in a number of ways and is thus a flexible tool for different NLP applications
p16
aVUnfortunately, SimRank has time complexity u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) (where n is the number of nodes in the graph) and therefore does not scale to the large graphs that are typical of NLP
p17
aVWe will see in Section 5 that this formulation is the basis for a very efficient version of CoSimRank
p18
aVLike CoSimRank, PPR+cos is efficient when computing single node pair similarities; we therefore use it as one of our baselines below
p19
aVIt is not obvious how to design a lower-complexity version of SimRank for this case
p20
aVWe use TS68 , a test set of 68 synonym pairs published by Minkov and Cohen ( 2012 ) for evaluation
p21
aVOur motivation for this application is that two words that are synonyms of each other should have similar lexical neighbors and that two words that are translations of each other should have neighbors that correspond to each other; thus, in each case the nodes should be similar in the graph-theoretic sense and CoSimRank should be able to identify this similarity
p22
aVThis is also true for CoSimRank, but it seems that CoSimRank is more stable because we compare more than one vector
p23
aV2006 ) introduce a similarity measure that is also based on the idea that nodes are similar when their neighbors are, but that is designed for bipartite graphs
p24
aVWe tried a number of different ways of modifying it for weighted graphs i) running the random walks with the weighted adjacency matrix as Markov matrix, (ii) storing the weight (product of each edge weight) of a random walk and using it as a factor if two walks meet and (iii) a combination of both
p25
aVThus, CoSimRank has the added advantage of being a flexible tool for different types of applications
p26
aVOne reason CoSimRank is efficient is that we need only compute a few iterations of the random walk
p27
aVWe use a seed dictionary of 12,630 word pairs to establish node-node correspondences between the two graphs
p28
aVWe are not including this method in our experiments, but we will give the equation here, as traditional document similarity measures (e.g.,, cosine similarity) perform poorly on this task although there also are known alternatives with good results [ 30 ]
p29
aVAs a result, the computational time was approximately 30 minutes per test word, so this method is even slower than SimRank for our application
p30
aVThis gold standard lists a single word as the correct synonym even if there are several equally acceptable near-synonyms (see Table 3 for examples
p31
aVHere we address inducing a bilingual lexicon from a seed set based on grammatical relations found by a parser
p32
aVThe cosine of two PPR vectors can be used as a similarity measure for the corresponding nodes [ 12 , 1 ]
p33
aVConsequently, we compare against the two main methods for this task in NLP
p34
aVBy providing some useful extensions, we demonstrate the great flexibility of CoSimRank (Section 5
p35
aVCoSimRank is better than PPR+cos on both evaluations, but as this test set is very small, the results are not significant
p36
aVPPR+cos performed best except for a new similarity measure based on commute time
p37
aVIf all three of them agreed on one word as being a synonym in at least one meaning, we added this as a correct answer to the test set
p38
aVSo we are doomed to fail if the original English word is a less common translation of an ambiguous German word
p39
aVA similar approach for word embeddings was published by Mikolov et al
p40
aVWhereas SimRank sets each of these entries back to one at each iteration, CoSimRank adds one
p41
aVMost of the 226 missing word pairs are adverbs, prepositions and plural forms that are not covered by our graphs due to the construction algorithm we use lemmatization, restriction to adjectives, nouns and verbs etc
p42
aVThe algorithm we propose below is an order of magnitude faster in such applications because it is based on a local formulation of the similarity measure
p43
aVSpace complexity for computing k 2 similarities is u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( k u'\u005cu2062' n ) since we need only store k vectors, not the complete similarity matrix
p44
aVWe remove a search keyword from the seed dictionary before calculating similarities for it, something that the architecture of CoSimRank makes easy because we can use a different seed dictionary S ( 0 ) for every keyword
p45
aVWe do not compare against this new measure as it uses the graph Laplacian and so cannot be computed for a single node pair
p46
aVThis offers large savings in computation time if we only need the similarities of a small subset of all n 2 node similarities
p47
aVHughes and Ramage ( 2007 ) find that PPR+cos has high correlation with human similarity judgments on WordNet-based graphs
p48
aVIf we only compute a single similarity, then the complexity is u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( d u'\u005cu2062' n
p49
aVThe novelty is that we compute similarity for vectors that are induced using a new algorithm, so that the similarity measurement is much more efficient when an application only needs a fraction of all u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 2 ) pairwise similarities
p50
aVWe use their Multi-Edge Extraction (MEE) algorithm as one of our baselines below
p51
aVAdditionally, TS774 was created by translating English words into German (using Google translate
p52
aVSince the original version of SimRank [ 15 ] has complexity u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 4 ) , many extensions have been proposed to speed up its calculation
p53
aVSo law and dress are similar because of the node tailor
p54
aVIf d k , then the time complexity of CoSimRank is u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( k 2 u'\u005cu2062' n
p55
aVA similar graph of dependency structures was built by Minkov and Cohen ( 2008
p56
aVWe can prevent this type of spurious similarity by taking into account the path the random surfer took to get to a particular node
p57
aVAs a result, time and space complexities are much improved
p58
aVAs the PPR vectors have only positive values, we can easily see in Eq
p59
aVIf the matrix formulation cannot be used because the u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 2 ) similarity matrix is too big for available memory, then we can compute all similarities in batches u'\u005cu2013' and if desired in parallel u'\u005cu2013' whose size is chosen such that the vectors of each batch still fit in memory
p60
aV4 4 We achieved better results for CoSimRank by optimizing the damping factor, but in this paper, we only present results for a fixed damping factor of 0.8
p61
aVFor example, the English word gulf was translated by Google to Golf , but the most common sense of Golf is the sport
p62
aV8 ) have time complexity u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) or u'\u005cu2013' if we want to take the higher efficiency of computation for sparse graphs into account u'\u005cu2013' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( d u'\u005cu2062' n 2 ) where n is the number of nodes and d the average degree
p63
aVIt is straightforward and easy to implement by replacing the row normalized adjacency matrix A with an arbitrary stochastic matrix P
p64
aVAs we can see in Table 7 , we also face the problems discussed by Laws et al
p65
aVHaveliwala ( 2002 ) introduced Personalized PageRank u'\u005cu2013' or topic-sensitive PageRank u'\u005cu2013' based on the idea that the uniform damping vector p ( 0 ) can be replaced by a personalized vector, which depends on node i
p66
aVMRR is equivalent to MAP as reported by Minkov and Cohen ( 2012 ) when there is only one correct answer.) Their best number (0.59) is better than our one-synonym result; however, they performed manual postprocessing of results u'\u005cu2013' e.g.,, discarding words that are morphologically or semantically related to other words in the list u'\u005cu2013' so our fully automatic results cannot be directly compared
p67
aVHowever, the PPR vector of law will also have a non-zero weight for tailor
p68
aVThe actual wall clock time was significantly lower as we used up to 64 CPUs
p69
aVThe results on TS774 can be considered conservative since only one translation is accepted as being correct
p70
aVWe formalize this by defining CoSimRank s u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) as follows
p71
aVThese algorithms are often based on PageRank [ 2 ] and other centrality measures (e.g.,, [ 7 ]
p72
aVThis measure s u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) looks at the probability that a random walker is on a certain edge after an unlimited number of steps
p73
aVThus, when computing the two similarity measures iteratively, the diagonal element ( i , i ) will be set to 1 by both methods for those initial iterations for which this entry is 0 for c u'\u005cu2062' A u'\u005cu2062' S ( k - 1 ) u'\u005cu2062' A T (i.e.,, before applying either max or add
p74
aVLet p u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) be the PPR vector of node i
p75
aVHence our algorithm will incorrectly translate it back to golf
p76
aVLooking at Table 1 , we see that there is only one edge type connecting adjectives
p77
aVSince our vectors are probability vectors, we have
p78
aVWe will refer to this measure as PPR+cos
p79
aVWe are now testing the reverse direction
p80
aV2010 the algorithm sometimes picks cohyponyms (which can still be seen as reasonable) and antonyms (which are clear errors
p81
aVThe cosine of two vectors u and v is computed by dividing the inner product u'\u005cu27e8' u , v u'\u005cu27e9' by the lengths of the vectors
p82
aVWe add a damping factor c , so that early meetings are more valuable than later meetings
p83
aVNote that the personalization vector p ( 0 ) was eliminated, but is still present as the starting vector of the iteration
p84
aVWe can interpret S ( 0 ) as a change of basis
p85
aVIf an upper bound of 1 is desired for s u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) (instead of 1 / ( 1 - c ) ), then we can use s u'\u005cu2032'
p86
aVThis is potentially problematic as the example in Figure 1 shows
p87
aVWe also know from elementary functional analysis that the 1-norm is the biggest of all p-norms and so one has u'\u005cu2225' p ( k ) u'\u005cu2225' u'\u005cu2264' 1
p88
aVWe therefore do not review graph-based methods that make extensive use of supervised learning (e.g.,, de Melo and Weikum ( 2012 )
p89
aVOur work is unsupervised
p90
aVWe evaluate CoSimRank for the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction
p91
aVWe use the basic version of CoSimRank (Eq
p92
aV4 ) for synonym extraction and the two-graph version (Eq
p93
aVThe disadvantage of this similarity measure is significant and even more visible on bilingual lexicon extraction than on synonym extraction (see Table 2
p94
aVSynonym extraction is run on the English graph
p95
aVThe counteracting effects of fewer iterations and more vector similarity computations can give either CoSimRank or PPR+cos an advantage, as is the case for synonym extraction and lexicon extraction, respectively
p96
aVCompared to PPR+cos, CoSimRank is roughly four times faster on synonym extraction and has comparable performance on lexicon extraction
p97
aVCompared to SimRank, CoSimRank is more than 40 times faster on synonym extraction and six times faster on lexicon extraction
p98
aV9 ) for lexicon extraction, both with weighted edges
p99
aVAnother important similarity measure is cosine similarity of Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors
p100
aVCoSimRank can either be interpreted as an efficient version of SimRank or as a version of Personalized PageRank for similarity measurement
p101
aVWe evaluate lexicon extraction on TS1000, a test set of 1000 items, [ 17 ] each consisting of an English word and its German translations
p102
aV7 ) and CoSimRank (Eq
p103
aVIn Section 4 , we compare CoSimRank and SimRank
p104
aVIn summary, modifications proposed for SimRank (weighted and typed edges, similarity across graphs) as well as modifications proposed for PageRank (sets of nodes) can also be applied to CoSimRank
p105
aVWe use the English and German graphs published by Laws et al
p106
aVThey applied different similarity measures, e.g.,, cosine of dependency vectors or a new algorithm called path-constrained graph walk, on synonym extraction [ 26 ]
p107
aVTable 1 gives examples and number of nodes and edges
p108
aVWe can use this edge weighted PageRank for CoSimRank
p109
aVThe matrix formulation of CoSimRank is
p110
aVThe analog of CoSimRank (Eq
p111
aVNodes are nouns, adjectives and verbs occurring in Wikipedia
p112
aVWhen the computation has converged, the similarity of two nodes is given by the cosine similarity of the Personalized PageRank vectors
p113
aVAs the seed dictionary contains 12,630 word pairs, this means that only every fourth entry of the PPR vector (the German graph has 47,439 nodes) is used for similarity calculation
p114
aVBoth CoSimRank methods outperform SimRank significantly (see Table 4
p115
aVGenerally, these methods compute the Personalized PageRank for each node (see Eq
p116
aVWe often want to compute the similarity of nodes in two different graphs with a known node-node correspondence; this is the scenario we are faced with in the lexicon extraction task (see Section 6
p117
aVWe also compare against the MEE (Multi-Edge Extraction) variant of SimRank [ 6 ] , which handles labeled edges more efficiently than SimRank
p118
aVThis makes CoSimRank a very flexible similarity measure
p119
aVand thus very similar to SimRank (Eq

aVThis paper introduces CoSimRank, 1 1 Code available at code.google.com/p/cistern a new graph-theoretic algorithm for computing node similarity that combines features of SimRank and PageRank

aV2010 ) , including edge weighting and normalization
p132
aVWe compare CoSimRank with their results in our experiments (see Section 6
p133
aVFor CoSimRank, we need only compute five iterations to reach convergence, but we have to compute a vector similarity in each iteration
p134
aVWithout expensive normalization, we can give a simple matrix formalization of CoSimRank and compute it efficiently using fast matrix multiplication algorithms
p135
aVSection 3 introduces CoSimRank
p136
aVAn alternative for tasks involving similarity is SimRank [ 15 ]
p137
aVTo be able to directly compare to prior work in our experiments, we also present a method to integrate a set of typed edges u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' in the CoSimRank calculation
p138
aVThese approaches use at least one of cosine similarity, PageRank and SimRank
p139
aVwhere p ( k ) u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) is the PPR vector of node i from Eq
p140
aVFrom Eq
p141
aVWe perform an experimental evaluation of CoSimRank in Section 6
p142
aVLexRank [ 7 ] is similar to PPR+cos in that it combines PageRank and cosine; it initializes the sentence similarity matrix of a document using cosine and then applies PageRank to compute lexical centrality
p143
aVThe sum of all similarities is the value of CoSimRank, i.e.,, the final similarity
p144
aVIn this method only the entries corresponding to the compared nodes are used for a similarity score
p145
aVThe difference between CoSimRank with and without typed edges is not significant
p146
aV2010 ) extend SimRank to edge weights, edge labels and multiple graphs
p147
aVThese two cases u'\u005cu2013' computing a few similarities and computing many similarities u'\u005cu2013' correspond to two different representations we can compute CoSimRank on a vector representation, which is fast for only a few similarities, and a matrix representation, which can take advantage of fast matrix multiplication algorithms
p148
aVPPR+cos u'\u005cu2019' s performance at 14.8 u'\u005cu2062' % correct translations is much lower than SimRank and CoSimRank
p149
aVwhere A u'\u005cu03a4' is the row-normalized adjacency matrix for edge type u'\u005cu03a4' (see edge types in Table 1
p150
aVIn an experimental evaluation, we show that CoSimRank is more efficient and more accurate than both SimRank and PageRank-based algorithms
p151
aV2008 ) compared PPR+cos to other graph based similarity measures like shortest-path and bounded-length random walks
p152
aV2 2 A reviewer suggests that CoSimRank is an efficient version of SimRank in a way analogous to SALSA u'\u005cu2019' s [ 19 ] relationship to HITS [ 16 ] in that different aspects of similarity are decoupled
p153
aVEntry i of the converged PPR vector represents the probability that the random surfer is on node i after an unlimited number of steps
p154
aVWe denote the number of nodes in the two graphs U and V by
p155
aVThe PPR vector of node i is given by

aVComplexity of computing all n 2 similarities
p157
aVThe reason might be that we are not comparing the whole PPR vector anymore, but only entries which occur in the seed dictionary (see Eq
p158
aV7 and 8 , we see that SimRank and CoSimRank are very similar except that they initialize the similarities on the diagonal differently
p159
aVSome other applications of SimRank or other graph based similarity measures in NLP include work on document similarity [ 21 ] , the transfer of sentiment information between languages [ 31 ] and named entity disambiguation [ 9 ]
p160
aVHowever, all of these methods have to run SimRank on the entire graph and are not efficient enough for very large graphs
p161
aVFor this we will compute a similarity matrix for each edge type u'\u005cu03a4' and merge them into one matrix for the next iteration
p162
aVWith A being the normalized adjacency matrix we can write SimRank in matrix formulation
p163
aVWe evaluate on a subset we call TS774 that consists of the 774 test word pairs that are in the intersection of words covered by the WINTIAN Wikipedia data [ 29 ] and words covered by our data
p164
aVWe compute 20 iterations of PPR+cos to reach convergence and then calculate a single cosine similarity
p165
aVThere are three types of edges, corresponding to three types of syntactic configurations extracted from the parsed Wikipedias adjective-noun, verb-object and noun-noun coordination
p166
aVCoSimRank can also be used to compute the similarity s u'\u005cu2062' ( V , W ) of two sets V and W of nodes, e.g.,, short text snippets
p167
aVApart from SimRank, many other similarity measures have been proposed
p168
aVWe compute PPR vectors p u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d'
p169
aVTo compute the similarity of two vectors u and v we use the inner product u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu22c5' , u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu27e9' in Eq
p170
aVContrary to our intuition, the edge-typed variant of CoSimRank did not perform significantly better than the non-edge-typed version
p171
aVThis observation was also made for SimRank on a smaller graph and test set [ 17 ]

aVFor a set V , the initial PPR vector is given by
p180
aVAn alternative approach is to induce a bilingual lexicon from Wikipedia u'\u005cu2019' s interwiki links [ 29 ]
p181
aVRecall that CoSimRank uses the simple inner product u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu22c5' , u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu27e9' to compare vectors
p182
aVDespite this superficial relatedness, applications like lexicon extraction that look for similar entities and applications that look for central entities are quite different
p183
aVHowever, in an evaluation of this algorithm we found that it does not give competitive results (see Section 6
p184
aVIn addition to faster versions of SimRank, there has also been work on extensions of SimRank
p185
aVA non-iterative computation for SimRank was introduced by Li et al
p186
aVHowever, most graphs in NLP are not bipartite and Jeh and Widom ( 2002 ) also proposed a SimRank variant for bipartite graphs

p215
aVThe accuracies P@1 and P@10 were worse in all experiments than those of CoSimRank
p216
aVThe reason could be that CoSimRank is a more effective algorithm than WINTIAN; but the different initializations (seed set vs interwiki links) or the different linguistic representations (grammatical relations vs bag-of-words) could also be responsible
