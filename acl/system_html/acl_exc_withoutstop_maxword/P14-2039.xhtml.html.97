<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the chunk size parameter increases, the performance of sliding window systems with different values of keep-length parameter converges</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The fact that the various instances of a single word in each transcription may fall on either side of a chunk boundary leads to errors where a word is either duplicated in the final output for more than one chunk, or omitted entirely</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After all, if the timestamps corresponded precisely to the original time at which each word was spoken, the entire alignment problem would be trivial</a>
