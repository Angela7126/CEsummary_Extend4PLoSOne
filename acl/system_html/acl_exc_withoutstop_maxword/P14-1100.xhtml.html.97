<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u201c' backwards u'\u201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more complicated than in observed models</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Intuitively, however, latent tree models encode low rank dependencies among the observed variables permitting the development of u'\u201c' spectral u'\u201d' methods that can lead to provably correct solutions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies</a>
