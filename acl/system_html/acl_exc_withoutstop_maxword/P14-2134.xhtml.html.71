<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A joint model has three a priori advantages over independent models i) sharing data across variable values encourages representations across those values to be similar; e.g.,, while city may be closer to Boston in Massachusetts and Chicago in Illinois, in both places it still generally connotes a municipality ; (ii) such sharing can mitigate data sparseness for less-witnessed areas; and (iii) with a joint model, all representations are guaranteed to be in the same vector space and can therefore be compared to each other; with individual models (each with different initializations), word vectors across different states may not be directly compared</a>
