<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The TS sum system selects sentences with greater counts of topic words and TS avg computes the number of topic words normalized by sentence length</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These systems combine (i) a score based on the background ( KL back , TS or SR ) with (ii) the score based on the input only ( KL inp</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In fact, the surprise methods have numerically higher ROUGE-1 scores compared to input similarity ( KL inp ) in contrast to generic summarization</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, to combine TS sum and KL inp for each sentence, we compute its scores based on the two methods</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization</a>
