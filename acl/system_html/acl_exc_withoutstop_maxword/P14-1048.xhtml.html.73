<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Each sentence S i , after being segmented into EDUs (not shown in the figure), goes through an intra-sentential bottom-up tree-building model M i u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' a , to form a sentence-level discourse tree T S i , with the EDUs as leaf nodes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the structure model is the first component in our pipeline of local models, its accuracy is crucial</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Third, after a discourse (sub)tree is fully built from bottom up, we perform a novel post-editing process by considering information from the constituents on upper levels</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If modifications have been proposed in the previous step, we build a new tree T p using P s u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' u u'\u2062' c u'\u2062' t as the structure model, and P r u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' l as the relation model, from the constituents on which modifications are proposed</a>
