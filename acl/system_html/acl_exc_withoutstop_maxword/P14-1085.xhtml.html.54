<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Notice the contribution from a sentence depends on individual salience, coherence ( C u'\u2062' C u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' h ) based on sentences visible on the user path down the hierarchy to this sentence, and coherence ( P u'\u2062' C u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' h ) based on its parent sentence and its child summary</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Moreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary</a>
