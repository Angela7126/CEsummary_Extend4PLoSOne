VWith the semantic phrase embeddings and the vector space transformation function, we apply the BRAE to measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates in the phrase-based SMT
p1
aVAssuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings
p2
aVAs the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction
p3
aVInstead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT
p4
aVAccordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning
p5
aVIf we learn the embedding of the Chinese phrase correctly, we can regard it as the gold representation for the English phrase and use it to guide the process of learning English phrase embedding
p6
aVThis indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings
p7
aVIn phrase table pruning, we discard the phrasal translation rules with low semantic similarity
p8
aVTherefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase
p9
aVIn decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation candidate selection
p10
aVWith the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate
p11
aVThis kind of semi-supervised phrase embedding is in fact performing phrase clustering with respect to the phrase label
p12
aVSimilarly, non-translation pairs should have different semantic meanings, and this information can also be used to guide learning semantic phrase embeddings
p13
aVAlthough we also follow the composition-based phrase embedding, we are the first to focus on the semantic meanings of the phrases and propose a bilingually-constrained model to induce the semantic information and learn transformation of the semantic space in one language to the other
p14
aVIn our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs
p15
aVFor instance, the semantic phrase embeddings can be directly fed to DNN to model the decoding process
p16
aVAs translation equivalents share the same semantic meaning, we employ high-quality phrase translation pairs as training corpus in this work
p17
aVTherefore, our model can be easily adapted to learn semantic phrase embeddings using paraphrases
p18
aVBesides using the semantic similarities to prune the phrase table, we also employ them as two informative features like the phrase translation probability to guide translation hypotheses selection during decoding
p19
aVGiven the BRAE model and the phrase training set, we search from the set the most semantically similar English phrases for any new input English phrase
p20
aV2011 ) make the phrase embeddings capture the sentiment information
p21
aVObviously, this kind methods of semi-supervised phrase embedding do not fully address the semantic meaning of the phrases
p22
aVIn contrast, our method attempts to learn the semantic vector representation for any phrase
p23
aVKalchbrenner and Blunsom ( 2013 ) utilize a simple convolution model to generate phrase embeddings from word embeddings
p24
aVTo have a better intuition about the power of the BRAE model at learning semantic phrase embeddings, we show some examples in Table 3
p25
aVWe can make inference from this fact that if a model can learn the same embedding for any phrase pair sharing the same meaning, the learned embedding must encode the semantics of the phrases and the corresponding model is our desire
p26
aVTwo tasks are involved in the experiments phrase table pruning that discards entries whose semantic similarity is very low and decoding with the phrasal semantic similarities as additional new features
p27
aVOne method considers the phrases as bag-of-words and employs a convolution model to transform the word embeddings to phrase embeddings [ 4 , 12 ]
p28
aVHowever, no gold semantic phrase embedding exists
p29
aVTherefore, we can imagine that learning semantic phrase embedding is reasonable if we are given gold vector representations of the phrases
p30
aVThus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings
p31
aVIn this way, the result Chinese and English phrase embeddings will capture the semantics as much as possible
p32
aVIdeally, we want the learned BRAE model can make sure that the semantic error for the positive example (a source phrase s and its correct translation t ) is much smaller than that for the negative example (the source phrase s and a bad translation t u'\u005cu2032'
p33
aVHowever, this kind of phrase embedding is hard to capture full semantics since the context of a phrase is limited
p34
aVBesides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual question answering, since the semantic similarity between phrases in different languages can be calculated accurately
p35
aVTo obtain high-quality bilingual phrase pairs to train our BRAE model, we perform forced decoding for the bilingual training sentences and collect the phrase pairs used
p36
aVSince word embeddings for two languages are learned separately and locate in different vector space, we do not enforce the phrase embeddings in two languages to be in the same semantic vector space
p37
aVThe models using word embeddings as the direct inputs to DNN cannot make full use of the whole syntactic and semantic information of the phrasal translation rules
p38
aVIn this paper, we explore the phrase embedding, which represents a phrase (sequence of words) with a real-valued vector
p39
aVInstead, our bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoders not only learn the composition mechanism of generating phrases from words, but also fine tune the word embeddings during the model training stage, so that we can induce the full information of the phrases and internal words
p40
aV2013 ) attempt to encode the reordering pattern in the phrase embeddings
p41
aVIn contrast, our BRAE model learns the semantic meaning for each phrase no matter whether it is short or relatively long
p42
aVIn addition, our semantic phrase embeddings have many other potential applications
p43
aVThe word embeddings will be fine-tuned in our BRAE model to capture much more semantics
p44
aVIn the semi-supervised RAE for phrase embedding, the objective function over a (phrase, label) pair ( x , t ) includes the reconstruction error and the prediction error, as illustrated in Fig
p45
aVIt indicates that our BRAE model is a good alternative for phrase table pruning
p46
aV2013 ) enable the phrase embeddings to mainly capture the syntactic knowledge
p47
aVIn contrast, our BRAE model focuses on compositional semantics from words to phrases
p48
aVThe core idea behind is that a phrase and its correct translation should share the same semantic meaning
p49
aVAnd the semi-supervised phrase embedding [ 23 , 21 , 16 ] further indicates that phrase embedding can be tuned with respect to the label
p50
aVFor example, in the RAE-based phrase reordering model for SMT [ 16 ] , the phrases with the similar reordering tendency (e.g., monotone or swap) are close to each other in the embedding space, such as the prepositional phrases
p51
aVThe phrase translation probability is based on co-occurrence statistics and the lexical weights consider the phrase as bag-of-words
p52
aVAccordingly, our BRAE model is trained on Chinese and English
p53
aVThen, they regard these phrases as indivisible units, and learn their embeddings with the context information
p54
aVGiven a phrase pair ( s , t ) , the BRAE model first obtains their semantic phrase representations ( p s , p t ) , and then transforms p s into target semantic space p s * , p t into source semantic space p t *
p55
aVIn phrase embedding using composition, the word vector representation is the basis and serves as the input to the neural network
p56
aVObviously, these methods of learning phrase embeddings either focus on some aspects of the phrase (e.g., reordering pattern), or impose strong assumptions (e.g., bag-of-words or indivisible n -gram
p57
aVTherefore, the semantic similarities computed using our BRAE model are complementary to the existing four translation probabilities
p58
aVTypically, four translation probabilities are adopted in the phrase-based SMT, including phrase translation probability and lexical weights in both directions
p59
aVIn the other direction, the Chinese phrase embedding can be learned in the same way
p60
aV2013 ) also use bag-of-words but learn BLEU sensitive phrase embeddings
p61
aVIn addition to the cross-lingual applications, we believe the BRAE model can be applied in many monolingual NLP tasks which depend on good phrase representations or semantic similarity between phrases, such as named entity recognition, parsing, textual entailment, question answering and paraphrase detection
p62
aVTherefore, in order to successfully apply DNN to model the whole translation process, such as modelling the decoding process, learning compact vector representations for the basic phrasal translation units is the essential and fundamental work
p63
aVFurthermore, a transformation function between the Chinese and English semantic spaces can be learned as well
p64
aVSeveral researchers extend the original RAEs to a semi-supervised setting so that the induced phrase embedding can predict a target label, such as polarity in sentiment analysis [ 23 ] , syntactic category in parsing [ 21 ] and phrase reordering pattern in SMT [ 16 ]
p65
aVPre-training applying unsupervised phrase embedding with standard RAE to pre-train the source- and target-side phrase representations p s and p t respectively (Section 2.1.2);
p66
aVSecond, even though we have no correct semantic phrase representation as the gold label, the phrases sharing the same meaning provide an indirect but feasible way
p67
aVOur work has the same objective, but instead of using corpus statistics, we attempt to measure the quality of the phrase pair from the view of semantic meaning
p68
aVWhere the source-side error given the target phrase representation includes reconstruction error and updated semantic error
p69
aV1, the Chinese phrase on the left and the English phrase on the right are translations with each other
p70
aVIt tries to minimize the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximize the semantic distance between non-translation pairs simultaneously
p71
aVIn experiments, we discard the phrase pair whose similarity in two directions are smaller than a threshold 3 3 To avoid the situation that all the translation candidates for a source phrase are pruned, we always keep the first 10 best according to the semantic similarity
p72
aVThe third method views any phrase as the meaningful composition of its internal words
p73
aVThe experiments show that up to 72% of the phrase table can be discarded without significant decrease on the translation quality, and in decoding with phrasal semantic similarities up to 1.7 BLEU score improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline can be achieved
p74
aVWe know from the semi-supervised phrase embedding that the learned vector representation can be well adapted to the given label
p75
aVThe final BRAE objective over the phrase pairs training set ( S , T ) becomes
p76
aVAnd then, they fine-tune the RAE according to the label of the phrase, such as the syntactic category in parsing (Socher et al., 2013a), the polarity in sentiment analysis [ 23 , 24 ] , and the reordering pattern in SMT [ 16 ]
p77
aVA 5-gram language model is trained on the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword corpus and the English part of bilingual training data
p78
aVWhen the phrase becomes longer, the unsupervised RAE cannot even capture the syntactic property
p79
aVBesides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks (e.g., cross-lingual question answering) and monolingual applications such as textual entailment, question answering and paraphrase detection
p80
aVThe monolingual data contains 1.06B words for Chinese and 1.12B words for English
p81
aVWe suppose there is a transformation between the two semantic embedding spaces
p82
aVThe hyper-parameters in the BRAE model include the dimensionality of the word embedding n in Eq
p83
aVFor example, as each node in the recursive auto-encoder shares the same weight matrix, the BRAE model would become weak at learning the semantic representations for long sentences with tens of words
p84
aVThese algorithms are based on corpus statistics including co-occurrence statistics, phrase pair usage and composition information
p85
aVAccordingly, we propose the Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE), whose basic goal is to minimize the semantic distance between the phrases and their translations
p86
aVThe table shows that the unsupervised RAE can at most capture the syntactic property when the phrases are short
p87
aVRecently, statistical machine translation (SMT) community has seen a strong interest in adapting and applying DNN to many tasks, such as word alignment [ 29 ] , translation confidence estimation [ 19 , 18 , 31 ] , phrase reordering prediction [ 16 ] , translation modelling [ 1 , 12 ] and language modelling [ 7 , 26 ]
p88
aVHowever, in the conventional (phrase-based) SMT, phrases are the basic translation units
p89
aVAs shown in Table 2, no matter what n is, the BRAE model can significantly improve the translation quality in the overall test data
p90
aVPruning most of the phrase table without much impact on translation quality is very important for translation especially in environments where memory and time constraints are imposed
p91
aVIn addition, we pre-train the word embedding with toolkit Word2Vec on large-scale monolingual data including the aforementioned data for SMT
p92
aVFor the phrase pair ( s , t ) , the joint error is
p93
aVIn some previous works, phrase embedding has been discussed from different views
p94
aVWhen the two algorithms using a similar portion of the phrase table 4 4 In the future, we will compare the performance by enforcing the two algorithms to use the same portion of phrase table (35% in BRAE and 36% in Significance), the BRAE-based algorithm outperforms the Significance algorithm on all the test sets except for MT04
p95
aVFor example, the significance pruning, which is proven to be a very effective algorithm, computes the probability named p-value, that tests whether a source phrase s and a target phrase t co-occur more frequently in a bilingual corpus than they happen just by chance
p96
aVFor unsupervised phrase embedding, the only objective is to minimize the sum of reconstruction errors at each node in the optimal binary tree
p97
aVThe overall error of the BRAE model is employed to guide the search procedure
p98
aVFortunately, we know the fact that the two phrases should share the same semantic representation if they express the same meaning
p99
aVGiven a phrase which is an ordered list of m words, each word has an index i into the columns of the embedding matrix L
p100
aVFurthermore, our model is much more intuitive because it is directly based on the semantic similarity
p101
aVThe SMT evaluation is conducted on Chinese-to-English translation
p102
aVSpecifically, the Significance algorithm can safely discard 64% of the phrase table at its threshold 12 with only 0.1 BLEU loss in the overall test
p103
aVIn fact, the phrases having the same meaning are translation equivalents in different languages, but are paraphrases in one language
p104
aVWe prefer to the second one since this kind of word embedding has already encoded some semantics of the words
p105
aVWe will first briefly present the unsupervised phrase embedding, and then describe the semi-supervised framework
p106
aVIn contrast, our BRAE-based algorithm can remove 72% of the phrase table at its threshold 0.7 with only 0.06 BLEU loss in the overall evaluation
p107
aVAnother method [ 20 ] deals with the phrases having a meaning that is not a simple composition of the meanings of its individual words, such as New York Times
p108
aV2013 ) consider a phrase as an indivisible n -gram
p109
aVUnlike previous methods, the BRAE model jointly learns two RAEs (Fig
p110
aVThis procedure can be performed with an co-training style algorithm so as to minimize the semantic distance between the translation equivalents 1 1 For simplicity, we do not show non-translation pairs here
p111
aVFirst, the recursive auto-encoder provides a reasonable composition mechanism to embed each phrase
p112
aVLDC2000T50, LDC2002L27, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2005T06, LDC2005T10 and LDC2005T34 contains 0.96M sentence pairs and 1.1M entity pairs with 27.7M Chinese words and 31.9M English words
p113
aVRecently, phrase embedding has drawn more and more attention
p114
aVAs a result, the overall semantic error becomes
p115
aVIn this work, we employ the toolkit Word2Vec [ 20 ] to pre-train the word embedding for the source and target languages
p116
aVThe RAE learns the vector representation of the phrase by recursively combining two children vectors in a bottom-up manner [ 23 ]
p117
aVThe input phrases contain different number of words
p118
aVAssuming the target phrase representation p t is available, the optimization of the source-side parameters is similar to that of semi-supervised RAE
p119
aVPhrase pairs that have a low similarity are more likely to be noise and more prone to be pruned
p120
aVSuppose we are given a positive example ( s , t ) , the correct translation t can be converted into a bad translation t u'\u005cu2032' by replacing the words in t with randomly chosen target language words
p121
aVBy optimizing the above objective, the phrases in the vector embedding space will be grouped according to the labels
p122
aVMost of these works attempt to improve some components in SMT based on word embedding , which converts a word into a dense, low dimensional, real-valued vector representation [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 20 ]
p123
aVFor a phrase pair ( s , t ) , two kinds of errors are involved
p124
aVFine-tuning with the BRAE model, using target-side phrase representation p t to update the source-side parameters u'\u005cu0398' s and obtain the fine-tuned source-side phrase representation p s u'\u005cu2032' , and meanwhile using p s to update u'\u005cu0398' t and get the fine-tuned p t u'\u005cu2032' , and then calculate the joint error over the training corpus;
p125
aVThe hyper-parameter u'\u005cu0391' weights the reconstruction and semantic error
p126
aVWe can see a common phenomenon in both of the algorithms for the first few thresholds, the phrase table becomes smaller and smaller while the translation quality is not much decreased, but the performance jumps a lot at a certain threshold (16 for Significance pruning, 0.8 for BRAE-based one
p127
aVAfter learning word embeddings with DNN [ 2 , 5 , 20 ] , each word in the vocabulary V corresponds to a vector x u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n , and all the vectors are stacked into an embedding matrix L u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n ◊
p128
aVFor example, the unsupervised RAE finds do not want for the input phrase do not agree
p129
aVOur BRAE model still has some limitations
p130
aVThey first find the phrases of this kind
p131
aV2) for any source-side phrase using the greedy algorithm [ 23 ]
p132
aVFurthermore, this method can only account for a very small part of phrases, since most of the phrases are compositional
p133
aVFor the word embedding L s , there are two choices
p134
aVThe higher the p-value, the more likely of the phrase pair to be spurious
p135
aVWe have implemented a phrase-based translation system with a maximum entropy based reordering model using the bracketing transduction grammar [ 27 , 28 ]
p136
aVAfter removing the duplicates, the remaining 1.12M bilingual phrase pairs (length ranging from 1 to 7) are obtained
p137
aV2 semantic error E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( s , t ; u'\u005cu0398' what is the semantic distance between the learned vector representations p s and p t
p138
aVThe same auto-encoder is re-used until the vector of the whole phrase is generated
p139
aVSecond, the word embedding matrix L s is pre-trained with DNN [ 2 , 5 , 20 ] using large-scale unlabeled monolingual data
p140
aVImproving the model to semantically embed sentences is left for our future work
p141
aVThe above equation also indicates that the source-side parameters u'\u005cu0398' s can be optimized independently as long as the semantic representation p t of the target phrase t is given to compute E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( s t , u'\u005cu0398' ) with Eq
p142
aVWe thus enhance the semantic error with both positive and negative examples, and the corresponding max-semantic-margin error becomes
p143
aVThe above RAE is completely unsupervised and can only induce general representations of the multi-word phrases
p144
aVTable 1 shows the comparison results between our BRAE-based pruning method and the significance pruning algorithm
p145
aVLike semi-supervised RAE [ 16 ] , the parameters u'\u005cu0398' in our BRAE model can also be divided into three sets
p146
aVThis kind of approaches does not take the word order into account and loses much information
p147
aVThus, the semantic distance is bidirectional the distance between p t and the transformation of p s , and that between p s and the transformation of p t
p148
aVThe target-side parameters u'\u005cu0398' t can be optimized in the same way as long as the source-side phrase representation p s is available

p153
aVWe use an example to explain our model

aVThis section introduces the Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE), that is inspired by two observations

aVu'\u005cu0398' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' c recursive auto-encoder parameter matrices W ( 1 ) , W ( 2 ) , and bias terms b ( 1 ) , b ( 2 ) for two languages (Section 3.1.2);
p212
aVThen, the derivatives for the parameters in the fixed binary tree will be calculated via backpropagation through structures [ 10 ]
p213
aVTo have a deep understanding of the parameters, we rewrite Eq
p214
aVWhere E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( s t , u'\u005cu0398' ) = E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( p t , f ( W s l p s + b s l ) ) means the transformation of p s is performed as follows we first multiply a parameter matrix W s l by p s , and after adding a bias term b s l we apply an element-wise activation function f = t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5'

aVThroughout this paper, n = 3 is used for better illustration as shown in Fig
p216
aVFor the dimensionality n , we have tried three settings n = 50 , 100 , 200 in our experiments
p217
aVAfter adding a bias term b ( 1 ) , we apply an element-wise activation function such as f = t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) , which is used in our experiments

aVWhere c 1 u'\u005cu2032' and c 2 u'\u005cu2032' are reconstructed children, W ( 2 ) and b ( 2 ) are parameter matrix and bias term for reconstruction respectively, and f ( 2 ) = t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' )

p224
aVIt seems a paradox that updating u'\u005cu0398' s needs p t while updating u'\u005cu0398' t needs p s
p225
aV14 and a new u'\u005cu0398' s is obtained
p226
aVE s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( t s , u'\u005cu0398' ) can be calculated in exactly the same way

aVWe draw u'\u005cu0391' from 0.05 to 0.5 with step 0.05, and u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu2062' s from { 10 - 6 , 10 - 5 , 10 - 4 , 10 - 3 , 10 - 2 }
p230
aVGiven y 1 = p , we can use Eq
p231
aV2 again to compute y 2 by setting the children to be [ c 1 ; c 2 ] = [ y 1 ; x 3 ]
p232
aVFinally, we choose u'\u005cu0391' = 0.15 , u'\u005cu039b' L = 10 - 2 , u'\u005cu039b' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' c = 10 - 3 and u'\u005cu039b' s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m = 10 - 3
