VThere are two rules for merging spans one merges two complete spans into an incomplete span, the other merges an incomplete span and a complete span into a large complete span
p1
aVWe can reversely get the the compressed parse tree by removing all virtual arcs from the full parse tree
p2
aVA span is a subtree over a number of consecutive words, with the leftmost or the rightmost word as its root
p3
aVFor any compressed sentence, we could augment its dependency tree by adding a virtual arc i - 1 u'\u005cu2192' i for each deleted word x i
p4
aVRecent studies used a subtree deletion model for compression [ 1 , 13 , 15 ] , which deletes a word only if its modifier in the parse tree is deleted
p5
aVSuppose x j is removed, there must be a virtual arc j - 1 u'\u005cu2192' j which is a conflict with the fact that x j is the leftmost word
p6
aVOur method extends Eisner u'\u005cu2019' s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number
