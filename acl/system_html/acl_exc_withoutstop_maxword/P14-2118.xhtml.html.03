<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Further, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We first tested the relationship between concreteness and subjectivity with a correlation analysis over noun concepts</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To evaluate their model of lexical concreteness, Turney et al</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>To explore the relationship between concreteness, subjectivity and meaning, we plotted the 20,000 highest frequency ( a , n ) pairs in the BNC in the CONC-SUBJ semantic space (Figure 2, top</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Specifically, objective adjectives are more likely to modify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Models were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>On the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression</a>
