VInspired by [ 36 ] and [ 14 ] , we adopt the graph model for Chinese spell checking for pinyin segmentation and typo correction, which is based on the shortest path word segmentation algorithm [ 1 ]
p1
aVCorresponding Chinese words are fetched from a PTC dictionary u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3b' c , which is a dictionary maps pinyin words to Chinese words, and added as vertices
p2
aVA Chinese word may contain from 1 to over 10 characters due to different word segmentation conventions
p3
aVTo make typo correction better, we consider to integrate it with PTC conversion using a joint model
p4
aVPossible legal syllables fetched from dictionary u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3b' p according to the input pinyin sequence
p5
aVThe advantage of pinyin IME is that it only adopts the pronunciation perspective of Chinese characters so that it is simple and easy to learn
p6
aVThe graph G = ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' ) is constructed based on graph G c for typo correction in Section 3.2
p7
aVWe release this assumption since our model solves segmentation, typo correction and PTC conversion jointly
p8
aVBut as the pinyin input is not segmented, it is nearly impossible to adopt previous spell checking methods for English to pinyin typo checking, although techniques for English spell checking have been well developed
p9
aVA bit confusing but interesting, pinyin typo correction and segmentation come as two sides of one problem when a pinyin sequence is mistyped, it is unlikely to be correctly segmented; when it is segmented in an awkward way, it is likely to be mistyped
p10
aVMost characters usually have unique pinyin representations, while a few Chinese characters may be pronounced in several different ways, so they may have multiple pinyin representations
p11
aVThe pinyin part is segmented according to the Chinese part
p12
aVNon-Chinese users may feel confused or even surprised if they know that when typing pinyin through an IME, Chinese IME users will never enter delimiters such as u'\u005cu201c' Space u'\u005cu201d' key to segment either pinyin syllables or pinyin words, but just input the entire un-segmented pinyin sequence
p13
aVSince pinyin syllables have a very limited vocabulary and follow a set of regularities strictly, it is convenient to perform pinyin syllable segmentation by using rules
p14
aVHowever, using pinyin words instead of syllables is not a wise choice because pinyin word segmentation is not so easy a task as syllable segmentation
p15
aVThe original vocabulary is not labeled with pinyin, thus we use the PTC dictionary of sunpinyin 1 1 http://code.google.com/p/sunpinyin/ which is an open source Chinese pinyin IME, to label the vocabulary u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb1' with pinyin
p16
aVAccording to our empirical statistics, when setting threshold T = 2 , for a sentence of M characters, the joint graph will have u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d'
p17
aVWe will also report the conversion error rate (ConvER) proposed by [ 44 ] , which is the ratio of the number of mistyped pinyin word that is not converted to the right Chinese word over the total number of mistyped pinyin words 3 3 Other evaluation metrics are also proposed by [ 44 ] which is only suitable for their system since our system uses a joint model
p18
aVAccording to our empirical observation, emission probabilities are mostly 1 since most Chinese words have unique pronunciation
p19
aVAs we observe on \u005cmsc Train that the average pinyin word length is 5.24, then typo rate in the experiment of [ 44 ] can be roughly estimated as
p20
aVThe emission probabilities are estimated using the lexical translation module of MOSES [ 17 ] as u'\u005cu201c' translation probability u'\u005cu201d' from pinyin to Chinese
p21
aVDue to few works have been done on modeling Chinese text entry, we have to refer to those corresponding results on English [ 32 , 22 , 6 ] , which show that the average typo rate is about 2%
p22
aVSince pinyin syllable is much shorter than pinyin word, this ratio can be higher for pinyin syllables
p23
aVPinyin is originally designed as the phonetic symbol of a Chinese character (based on the standard modern Chinese, mandarin) , using Latin letters as its syllable notation
p24
aVFor example, if one wants to input u'\u005cu201c' \u005csong u'\u005cu4f60' u'\u005cu597d' u'\u005cu4e16' u'\u005cu754c'  (Hello world) u'\u005cu201d' , he will just type u'\u005cu201c' nihaoshijie u'\u005cu201d' instead of segmented pinyin sequence u'\u005cu201c' ni hao shi jie u'\u005cu201d'
p25
aVIf the corresponding pinyin syllables in G c have an edge between them, the vertices in G also have an edge
p26
aVSyllables with Levenshtein distance under a certain threshold are considered as similar
p27
aVThey solved the typo correction problem by decomposing the conditional probability P ( H
p28
aVWe will use conventional sequence labeling evaluation metrics such as sequence accuracy and character accuracy 2 2 We only work on the PTC conversion part of IME, thus we are unable to use existing evaluation systems [ 15 ] for full Chinese IME functions
p29
aVMerely using the above model, the typo correction result is not satisfying yet, no matter how much effort is paid
p30
aVWe therefore choose N = 10 as trade-off
p31
aVSince Chinese characters are entered via IME, those user-made typos do not immediately lead to spelling errors
p32
aVThus we generate corpora from \u005cmsc Dev with typo rate of 0% ( 0-P ), 2% ( 2-P ), and 5% ( 5-P ) to evaluate the system
p33
aVThough no direct proofs can be found to indicate if Google Input Tool has an independent typo correction component, its outputs show that such a component is unlikely available
p34
aVAn efficient heap data structure is required in K -shortest paths algorithm [ 7 ] for backtracking the best paths to current vertex while traversing
p35
aVThe major reason is that the basic semantic unit of Chinese language is actually word (tough vaguely defined) which is usually composed of several characters
p36
aVThe collected data consists of 775 mistyped pinyin words caused by one edit operation, and 85 caused by two edit operations
p37
aVThus we set the threshold T for u'\u005cu2112' to 2
p38
aVThe idea of u'\u005cu201c' statistical input method u'\u005cu201d' was proposed by modeling PTC conversion as a hidden Markov model (HMM), and using Viterbi [ 26 ] algorithm to decode the sequence
p39
aVAlthough the model is formulated on first order HMM, i.e.,, the LM used for transition probability is a bigram one, it is easy to extend the model to take advantage of higher order n -gram LM, by tracking longer history while traversing the graph
p40
aVSince sunpinyin does not have typo correction module and performs much poorer than our baseline system, we do not include it in the comparison
p41
aVThe shortest path segmentation algorithm is based on the idea that a reasonable segmentation should minimize the number of segmented units
p42
aVThe vertex weight is the Levenshtein distance multiply by a normalization parameter
p43
aVSince Google Input Tool has to be accessed through a web interface and the network connection cannot be guaranteed we only take a subset of 10K sentences of \u005cmsc Test to perform the experiments, and the results are shown in Table 3
p44
aVThe scores reported in [ 44 ] are not listed in Table 4 since the data set is different
p45
aVThe typo rate is set according to previous Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) studies
p46
aVThe user may fail to input the completely right pinyin simply because he/she is a dialect speaker and does not know the exact pronunciation for the expected character
p47
aVAnother benefit provided by K -shortest paths is that it can be used for generating N -best candidates of PTC conversion, which may be helpful for further performance improvement
p48
aVThus there are two separated sub-tasks for Chinese spell checking
p49
aVIf the adjacent syllables can be merged into a legal syllable, the merged syllable is also added into u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d'
p50
aVFor example, one intends to input u'\u005cu201c' \u005csong u'\u005cu4f60' u'\u005cu597d' u'\u005cu4e16' u'\u005cu754c'  (Hello world) u'\u005cu201d' by typing u'\u005cu201c' nihaoshijie u'\u005cu201d' , but mistyped as u'\u005cu201c' m ihaoshiji w u'\u005cu201d'
p51
aVThus the conditional probability between characters does not make much sense
p52
aVHowever, real user input data can be very noisy and not very convenient to obtain
p53
aVTo reduce the scale of graph G , we filter graph G c by searching its K -shortest paths first to get G c u'\u005cu2032' and construct G on top of G c u'\u005cu2032'
p54
aVHowever, every Chinese word inputted into computer or cellphone cannot be typed through one-to-one mapping of key-to-letter inputting directly, but has to go through an IME as there are thousands of Chinese characters for inputting while only 26 letter keys are available in the keyboard
p55
aVThe vertex weight consists of two parts
p56
aVWe choose K = 20 since there is no significant improvement when K 20
p57
aVFrom our statistics on \u005cmsc Train , with 2% randomly generated typos, P r ( u'\u005cu2112' ( S u'\u005cu2032' , S ) 2 ) = 99.86 %
p58
aVThe scale of graph may be thus drastically reduced
p59
aVThis vocabulary u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb1' also serves as the PTC dictionary
p60
aVSo in this step we set u'\u005cu0393' = 0
p61
aVThe heap is implemented as a priority queue of size K sorted according to path length that should support efficient push and pop operations
p62
aVAccording to the results, we then choose the trigram LM using Kneser-Ney smoothing with interpolation
p63
aVThis may be a very common situation since there are about seven quite different dialects in Chinese, among which being spoken languages, six are far different from the standard modern Chinese, mandarin
p64
aVWithout word delimiters, linguists have argued on what a Chinese word really is for a long time and that is why there is always a primary word segmentation treatment in most Chinese language processing tasks [ 40 , 13 , 41 , 39 , 42 , 43 ]
p65
aVFibonacci heap [ 9 ] is adopted for the heap implementation since it has a push complexity of O u'\u005cu2062' ( 1 ) which is better than the O u'\u005cu2062' ( K ) for other heap structures
p66
aVThis is the single source shortest path (SSSP) problem on DAG which has an efficient algorithm by preprocessing the DAG with topology sort, then traversing vertices and edges in topological order
p67
aVP ) of Chinese character sequence H given pinyin sequence P into a language model P ( w i w i - 1 ) and a typing model P ( p i w i
p68
aVWith the boom of smart-phones, pinyin typos worsen due to the limited size of soft keyboard, and the lack of physical feedback on the touch screen
p69
aVThe joint graph model aims to find the global optimal for both PTC conversion and typo correction on the entire input pinyin sequence
p70
aVPTC conversion is to decode the Chinese word sequence from the pinyin sequence
p71
aVAs we will propose a joint model in this paper, such an individual typing model is not necessarily built in our approach
p72
aVIn the HMM for pinyin IME, observation states are pinyin syllables, hidden states are Chinese words, emission probability is P ( s i w i ) , and transition probability is P ( w i w i - 1
p73
aVNext in the correction step, for the segmented pinyin sequence S 1 , S 2 , u'\u005cu2026' , S M , a graph G c is constructed to perform typo correction
p74
aVwhich is similar to the conclusion on English
p75
aVThe best Chinese character sequence W * for a given pinyin syllable sequence S is the one with the highest conditional probability P ( W
p76
aVFirstly we build a baseline system without typo correction which is a pipeline of pinyin syllable segmentation and PTC conversion
p77
aVThe baseline system takes a pinyin input sequence, segments it into syllables, and then converts it to Chinese character sequence
p78
aVNevertheless, pinyin syllable segmentation is a much easier problem compared to Chinese word segmentation
p79
aVS i , j ) that a syllable S i , j is followed by S j + 1 , k , which is give by a bi-gram language model of pinyin syllables
p80
aV1 typo checking for user typed pinyin sequences which should be a built-in module in IME, and 2 spell checking for Chinese texts in its narrow sense, which is typically a module of word processing applications [ 36 ]
p81
aVPinyin typos have always been a serious problem for Chinese pinyin IMEs
p82
aVNormally, the user may immediately notice the inputting error and then make corrections, which usually means doing a bunch of extra operations like cursor movement, deletion and re-typing
p83
aVGiven HMM decoding problem is identical to SSSP problem on DAG, we propose a joint graph model for PTC conversion with typo correction
p84
aVEach pinyin syllable has a bunch of corresponding Chinese characters which share the same pronunciation represented by the syllable
p85
aVThe very first approach for Chinese input with typo correction was made by [ 4 ] , which was also the initial attempt of u'\u005cu201c' sentence-based u'\u005cu201d' IME
p86
aV1 the vertex weights of syllables in G c , and 2 the emission probability
p87
aVNowadays most of Chinese IMEs are pinyin based
p88
aVHowever their model depended on a very strong assumption that input pinyin sequence should have been segmented into pinyin words by the user
p89
aVFor a pinyin sequence p 1 u'\u005cu2062' p 2 u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2026' u'\u005cu2062' p L , where p i is a letter, first a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G S = ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' ) is built for pinyin segmentation step
p90
aVBased upon the baseline system, we build the joint system of PTC conversion with typo correction
p91
aVThe vertex set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' consists of the following parts
p92
aVThe vertex set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' consists of the following parts
p93
aVThe vertex set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' consists of the following parts
p94
aVFor example, the pinyin of the Chinese character u'\u005cu201c' \u005csong u'\u005cu7231' u'\u005cu201d' (love) is u'\u005cu201c' ài u'\u005cu201d'
p95
aVComputing the shortest path from V 0 to V E on G yields the best pinyin-to-Chinese conversion with typo correction result
p96
aVThe shortest path algorithm for typo correction and Viterbi algorithm for PTC conversion are very closely related
p97
aVThe typing model that was estimated on real user input data was for typo correction
p98
aVModern pinyin IMEs mostly use a u'\u005cu201c' sentence-based u'\u005cu201d' decoding technique [ 4 ] to alleviate the ambiguities u'\u005cu201c' Sentence based u'\u005cu201d' means that IME generates a sequence of Chinese characters upon a sequence of pinyin inputs with respect to certain statistical criteria
p99
aVComputing the shortest path from S 0 u'\u005cu2032' to S E u'\u005cu2032' on G c yields the best typo correction result
p100
aVAdjacent pinyin syllables in G c are merged into pinyin words
p101
aVTypically, an IME takes the pinyin input, segments it into syllables, looks up corresponding words in a dictionary and generates a sentence with the candidate words
p102
aVConsidering our running example, the graph G c is shown in Figure 3 , and the typo correction result is u'\u005cu201c' mi hao shi jie u'\u005cu201d'
p103
aVThe vertex set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd4d' includes

aVEdges from the start vertex E ( v 0 u'\u005cu2192' v x 1 ) with edge weight
p105
aVOur results are compared to the baseline system without typo correction and Google Input Tool
p106
aVBut there are only less than 500 pinyin syllables in standard modern Chinese, compared with over 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which leads to serious ambiguities for pinyin-to-character mapping
p107
aVIn addition, a pinyin syllable usually maps to dozens or even hundreds of corresponding homophonic characters, which makes the conditional probability between syllables much more noisy
p108
aVWe can observe that MIU-Acc slightly decreases while N goes up, but Ch-Acc largely increases
p109
aVThe graph for this input is shown in Figure 2

aVFigure 1 demonstrates the relationship of pinyin and word, from pinyin letters u'\u005cu201c' nihao u'\u005cu201d' to the word u'\u005cu201c' \u005csong u'\u005cu4f60' u'\u005cu597d'  (hello) u'\u005cu201d'

aVBesides the common HMM approach for PTC conversion, there are also various methods such as support vector machine [ 16 ] , maximum entropy (ME) model [ 30 ] , conditional random field (CRF) [ 19 ] and statistical machine translation (SMT) [ 35 , 29 , 38 ] , etc
p186
aVThe selection of K also directly guarantees the running time of the joint model
p187
aVWe will mainly consider MIU accuracy (MIU-Acc) which is the ratio of the number of completely corrected generated MIUs over the number of all MIUs, and character accuracy (Ch-Acc), but the sentence accuracy (S-Acc) will also be reported in evaluation results
p188
aVThe number of those homophones ranges from 1 to over 300
p189
aVThe edge weights are the negative logarithm of the transition probabilities
p190
aVA recent spell correction work is [ 20 ] , where a distributional similarity was introduced for spell correction of web queries
p191
aVThe joint graph is rather huge and density
p192
aV[ 23 ] addressed that spell checking should be done within a context, i.e.,, a sentence or a long phrase with a certain meaning, instead of only in one word
p193
aVWith K = 20 , on a normal PC with Intel Pentium Dual-Core E6700 CPU, the PTC conversion rate is over 2000 characters-per-minute ( cpm ), which is much faster than the normal typing rate of 200 cpm
p194
aVThis assumption does not really hold in modern u'\u005cu201c' sentence-based u'\u005cu201d' IMEs
p195
aVThe optimization goal of P * in Equation ( 3.3 ) is identical to that of X * in Equation ( 1
p196
aVThe parameter u'\u005cu0393' determines emission probability

aVSRILM [ 25 ] is adopted for language model training and KenLM [ 12 , 11 ] for language model query
p198
aVThese two terms are often confused especially in IME related works such as [ 4 ] and [ 34 ]
p199
aVWe continue to follow this formalization
p200
aVWe simulate user typos by randomly generating errors automatically on the corpus
p201
aVWe will continue to use this example in the rest of this paper
p202
aVWe consider different LM smoothing methods including Kneser-Ney (KN), improved Kneser-Ney (IKN), and Witten-Bell (WB
p203
aVIn addition, the result has been segmented so far
p204
aVThe Viterbi algorithm [ 26 ] is used for the decoding
p205
aVAll of the three smoothing methods for bigram and trigram LMs are examined both using back-off models and interpolated models
