VCoverage relates to how the semantic domain of a construction is populated in the vicinity of a given target coinage, and in particular to the density of the semantic space
p1
aVThe resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study
p2
aVThe semantic plots corresponding to the distribution of the construction in each period are presented in Figure 2
p3
aVTo answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information
p4
aVFor each Verb - Period - Occurrence triplet, the density of the semantic space around the verb in the immediately preceding period was calculated
p5
aVIn view of the observations collected on the semantic plots and in line with previous research (especially Suttle and Goldberg u'\u005cu2019' s notion of coverage), I suggest that the occurrence of a new item in
