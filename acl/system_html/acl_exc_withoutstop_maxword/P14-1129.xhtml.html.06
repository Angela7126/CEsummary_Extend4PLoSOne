<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Specifically, we introduce a novel formulation for a neural network joint model (NNJM), which augments an n -gram target language model with an m -word source window</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We follow the standard n -gram LM decomposition of the target, where each target word t i is conditioned on the previous n - 1 target words</a>
