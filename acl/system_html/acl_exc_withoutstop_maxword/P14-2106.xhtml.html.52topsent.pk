VBroadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora []

aVFor each semantic representation, we need to determine the semantics of each occurrence of a target word used i) gold-standard annotations from SemCor, a subset of the PTB, to give an upper bound performance of the semantic representation, ii) first sense, where all instances of a word were tagged with their most frequent sense, and iii) automatic sense ranking, predicting the most frequent sense for each word []
