<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So to sum up on the u'\u201c' labeled evaluation u'\u201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to our linguistic knowledge</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In some experiments, we make use of alternative representations, which we refer later as u'\u201c' labeled representation u'\u201d' , in which the MWE features are incorporated in the dependency labels, so that MWE composition and/or the POS of the MWE be totally contained in</a>
