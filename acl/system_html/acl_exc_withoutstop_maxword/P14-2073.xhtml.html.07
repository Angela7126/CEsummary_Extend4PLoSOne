<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter u'\u2019' s initial model to the model out of these 20 with the highest in-sample NMI</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The results for these experiments, depicted in Figure 2 , indicate that the size of the initialization sample improves mean NMI and reduces variance, and that the variance of the particle filter itself is dominated by the variance of the initial model</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Then, for each dataset, for rejuvenation disabled, rejuvenation based on a reservoir of size 1000, and rejuvenation based on the entire history (in turn), we perform 30 runs of the particle filter from that fixed initial model</a>
