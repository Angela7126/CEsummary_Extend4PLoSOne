<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So, using a far smaller set of training data we can build a smaller model which still demonstrates a competitive performance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As it is possible to better leverage the information in smaller and sparse data sets, we can build smaller models of competitive performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Beyond the general improvements there is an additional path for benefitting from generalized language models</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This GLM model has a size of 9.5 GB and contains only 427 Mio entries</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We see that the GLM performs particularly well on small training data</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have stopped at the 0.008 u'\u2062' % / 99.992 u'\u2062' % split as the training data set in this case consisted of less words than our 100k test sequences which we still randomly sampled from the test data of</a>
