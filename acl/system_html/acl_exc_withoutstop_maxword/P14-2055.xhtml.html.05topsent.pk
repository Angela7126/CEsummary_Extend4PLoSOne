VInput + background
p1
aVCentral to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u005cu2019' s topic
p2
aVWe use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) update summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set
p3
aVThe TS sum system selects sentences with greater counts of topic words and TS avg computes the number of topic words normalized by sentence length
p4
aVIn fact, the surprise methods have numerically higher ROUGE-1 scores compared to input similarity ( KL inp ) in contrast to generic summarization
p5
aVIn this generic task, some of the best reported results were obtained by a system
