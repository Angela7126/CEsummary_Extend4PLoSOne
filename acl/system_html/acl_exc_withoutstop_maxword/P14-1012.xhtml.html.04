<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To address the first shortcoming, we adapt and extend some simple but effective phrase features as the input features for new DNN feature learning, and these features have been shown significant improvement for SMT, such as, phrase pair similarity [ Zhao et al.2004 ] , phrase frequency, phrase length [ Hopkins and May2011 ] , and phrase generative probability [ Foster et al.2010 ] , which also show further improvement for new phrase feature learning in our experiments</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, the input original features for the DBN feature learning are too simple, the limited 4 phrase features of each phrase pair, such as bidirectional phrase translation probability and bidirectional lexical weighting [ Koehn et al.2003 ] , which are a bottleneck for learning effective feature representation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our semi-supervised DAE features significantly outperform the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, and our introduced input phrase features significantly improve the performance of DAE feature learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, although we have introduced another four types of phrase features ( X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 ), the only 16 features in X are a bottleneck for learning large hidden layers feature representation, because it has limited information, the performance of the high-dimensional DAE features which are directly learned from single DAE is not very satisfactory</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Following [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we use the following 4 phrase features of each phrase pair [ Koehn et al.2003 ] in the phrase table as the first type of input features, bidirectional phrase translation probability ( P ( e f ) and P ( f e ) ),</a>
