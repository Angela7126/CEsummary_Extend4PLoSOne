<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We believe that the Wsabie Embedding model performs better than the Log-Linear Embedding baseline (that uses the same input representation) because the former setting allows examples with different labels and confusion sets to share information; this is due to the fact that all labels live in the same label space, and a single projection matrix is shared across the examples to map the</a>
