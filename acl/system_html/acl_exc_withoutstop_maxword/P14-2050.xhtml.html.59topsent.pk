VIn this paper we experiment with dependency-based syntactic contexts
p1
aVWe thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity
p2
aVSyntactic contexts capture different information than bag-of-word contexts, as we demonstrate using the sentence u'\u005cu201c' Australian scientist discovers star with telescope u'\u005cu201d'
p3
aVAn alternative to the bag-of-words approach is to derive contexts based on the syntactic relations the word participates in
p4
aVThey capture relations to words that are far apart and thus u'\u005cu201c' out-of-reach u'\u005cu201d' with small window bag-of-words (e.g., the instrument of discover is telescope/prep_with ), and also filter out u'\u005cu201c' coincidental u'\u005cu201d' contexts which are within the window but not directly related to the target word (e.g., Australian is not used as the context for discovers
