VBoth the LD and TLD models are computational-level models of phonetic (specifically, vowel) categorization where phones (vowels) are presented to the model in the context of words
p1
aVIn the LD model, vowel phones appear within words drawn from the lexicon
p2
aVThis is the baseline IGMM model, which clusters vowel tokens using bottom-up distributional information only; the LD model adds top-down information by assigning categories in the lexicon, rather than on the token level
p3
aVTo demonstrate the benefit of situational information, we develop the Topic-Lexical-Distributional (TLD) model, which extends the LD model by assuming that words appear in situations analogous to documents in a topic model
p4
aVThe TLD model retains the IGMM vowel phone component, but extends the lexicon of the LD model by adding topic-specific lexicons, which capture the notion that lexeme probabilities are topic-dependent
p5
aVOur own Topic-Lexical-Distributional (TLD) model extends the LD model to include an additional type of context the situations in which words appear
p6
aVWe compare all three models u'\u005cu2014' TLD, LD, and IGMM u'\u005cu2014' on the vowel categorization task, and TLD and LD on the lexical categorization task (since IGMM does not infer a lexicon
p7
aV11 ) implemented the Lexical-Distributional (LD) model, which jointly learns a set of phonetic vowel categories and a set of word-forms containing those categories
p8
aVFollowing previous models of vowel learning ( 8 ; 50 ; 26 ; 9 ) we assume that vowel tokens are drawn from a Gaussian mixture model
p9
aVIn the HDP lexicon, a top-level global lexicon is generated as in the LD model
p10
aVBoth the TLD and the LD models find u'\u005cu2018' supervowel u'\u005cu2019' categories, which cover multiple vowel categories and are used to merge minimal pairs into a single lexical item
p11
aVThe task is to infer a set of phonetic categories and a set of lexical items on the basis of the data observed for each word token x i
p12
aVThese datasets are intended to evaluate the degree of reliance on consonant information in the LD and TLD
