<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, our segmenter is faster than MADA</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our segmenter achieves higher scores than MADA and MADA-ARZ on all datasets under both evaluation metrics</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Table 1 contains results on the development set for the model of Green and DeNero and our improvements</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our segmenter achieves a 95.1% F 1 segmentation score evaluated against a gold standard on Egyptian dialect data, compared to 90.8% for MADA-ARZ and 92.9% for Green and DeNero</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our segmenter achieves a 7x or more speedup over MADA and MADA-ARZ on all datasets</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We demonstrate that our system achieves better performance across the board, beating all three systems on MSA newswire, informal broadcast news, and Egyptian dialect</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, our model decodes input an order of magnitude faster than either version of MADA</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using domain adaptation alone helps</a>
