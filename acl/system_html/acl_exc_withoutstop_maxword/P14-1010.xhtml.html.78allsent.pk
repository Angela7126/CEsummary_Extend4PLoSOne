VWork on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration
p1
aVThe chains found by this search are desegmented and then added to the output lattice as edges
p2
aVThis can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words
p3
aVThe second indicates that the source words contained a single discontiguity, as in a word-by-word translation of the u'\u005cu201c' with his blue car u'\u005cu201d' example from Section 2.2
p4
aVIn summary, we are given a segmented lattice, which encodes the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s translation space as an acceptor over morphemes
p5
aVThis is sometimes referred to as a word graph [ 32 ] , although in our case the segmented phrase table also produces tokens that correspond to morphemes
p6
aVWe approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words
p7
aVFinnish does not require a table, as all words can be desegmented with simple concatenation
p8
aVWe provide the desegmentation score log p ( Y
p9
aVOnce n -best lists have been desegmented, we can tune on unsegmented references as a side-benefit
p10
aVThe one-best approach can be extended easily by desegmenting n -best lists of segmented decoder output
p11
aVInstead of producing an abstract feature layer, morphological segmentation transforms the target sentence by segmenting relevant morphemes, which are then handled as regular tokens during alignment and translation
p12
aVWhen translating from Arabic, this segmentation process is performed as input preprocessing and is otherwise transparent to the translation system
p13
aVWe compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice
p14
aVFor the sake of symmetry with the unambiguous Finnish case, we augment Arabic n -best lists or lattices with only the most frequent desegmentation Y
p15
aVOur goal is to desegment the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s output lattice, and in doing so, gain access to a compact, desegmented view of a large portion of the translation search space
p16
aVA desegmenting transducer can be constructed by first encoding our desegmenter as a table that maps morpheme sequences to words
p17
aVA valid chain is complete if its edges form an entire word, and if it is part of a path through the lattice that consists only of words
p18
aVAs in Finnish, the 1-best desegmentation using Morfessor did not surpass the unsegmented baseline, producing a test BLEU of only 31.4 (not shown in Table 1
p19
aVIn Equation 1 only, we overload u'\u005cu201c' + u'\u005cu201d' as the Kleene cross
p20
aVThe first feature indicates that the desegmented morphemes were translated from contiguous source words
p21
aVRegardless of whether the original desegmenter was based on concatenation, rules or table-lookup, it can be encoded as a lattice-specific table by applying it to an enumeration of all words found in the lattice
p22
aVDoing so enables the inclusion of an unsegmented target language model, and with a small amount of bookkeeping, it also allows the inclusion of features related to the operations performed during desegmentation (see Section 3.4
p23
aVThis could improve translation quality, as it brings our training scenario closer to our test scenario (test BLEU is always measured on unsegmented references
p24
aVThe lattice (Figure 1 a) can then be desegmented by composing it with the transducer ( 1 b), producing a desegmented lattice ( 1 c
p25
aVMost techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model
p26
aVNonetheless, the 1000-best and lattice desegmenters both produce significant improvements over the 1-best desegmentation baseline, with Lattice Deseg achieving a 1-point improvement in TER
p27
aVAlternatively, one can reparameterize existing phrase tables as exponential models, so that translation probabilities account for source context and morphological features [ 16 , 30 ]
p28
aVWe also tried a similar Morfessor-based segmentation for Arabic, which has an unsegmented test set BLEU of 32.7
p29
aVY ) as an additional feature, but observed no improvement in translation quality
p30
aVDesegmentation is typically performed as a post-processing step that is independent from the decoding process
p31
aVWe use a table-based desegmentation method for Arabic, which is based on segmenting an Arabic training corpus and memorizing the observed transformations to reverse them later
p32
aVFortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously by composing the desegmented lattice with a finite state acceptor encoding the LM [ 26 ]
p33
aVAs these evaluation sets are intended for Arabic-to-English translation, we select the first English reference to use as our source text
p34
aVIn this section, we describe our various strategies for desegmenting the SMT system u'\u005cu2019' s output space, along with the features that we add to take advantage of this desegmented view
p35
aVThe nodes at end points of these chains are added to the work list, as they lie at word boundaries by definition
p36
aVThis category is challenging for the decoder because English prepositions tend to correspond to multiple possible forms when translated into Arabic
p37
aVFor the desegmenting re-rankers, this means 5 runs of re-ranker tuning, each working on n -best lists or lattices produced by the same (representative) decoder weights
p38
aVMorphological segmentation addresses this issue by splitting surface forms into meaningful morphemes, while also performing orthographic transformations to further reduce sparsity
p39
aVTo improve coverage, words are further segmented according to their longest matching suffix from the list
p40
aVThe search graph of a phrase-based decoder can be interpreted as a lattice, which can be interpreted as a finite state acceptor over target strings
p41
aVSince our focus here is on integrating segmentation into the decoding process, we simply adopt the segmentation strategies recommended by previous work the Penn Arabic Treebank scheme for English-Arabic [ 9 ] , and an unsupervised scheme for English-Finnish [ 7 ]
p42
aVX ) = log u'\u005cu2061' ( count of X u'\u005cu2192' Y count of X ) as a feature, to indicate the entry u'\u005cu2019' s ambiguity in the training data
p43
aVWe demonstrate that significant improvements in translation quality can be achieved by training a linear model to re-rank this transformed translation space
p44
aVAs Morfessor does not perform any orthographic normalizations, it can be desegmented with simple concatenation
p45
aVA chain is valid if it emits the beginning of a word as defined by the regular expression in Equation 1
p46
aVOther approaches train an SMT system to predict lemmas instead of surface forms, and then inflect the SMT output as a post-processing step [ 21 , 7 , 11 , 10 ]
p47
aVWork on integration attempts to improve SMT performance for morphologically complex target languages by going beyond simple pre- and post-processing
p48
aVMorphological complexity leads to much higher type to token ratios than English, which can create sparsity problems during translation model estimation
p49
aVThe search recognizes the valid chain c to be complete by finding an edge e such that c + e forms a chain, but not a valid one
p50
aVIn order to maintain some control over this powerful capability, we create three binary features that indicate the contiguity of a desegmentation
p51
aVFor both segmented and unsegmented Arabic, we further normalize the script by converting different forms of Alif ¡a u'\u005cu2019' A u'\u005cu2019' a u'\u005cu2019' i ¿ and Ya ¡y _A¿ to bare Alif ¡a¿ and dotless Ya ¡_A¿
p52
aV8 8 Development experiments on a small-data English-to-Arabic scenario indicated that the Desegmentation Score was not particularly useful, so we exclude it from the main comparison, but include it in the ablation experiments
p53
aVFor the baselines, this means 5 runs of decoder tuning
p54
aVAs we attempted to replicate the approach of Clifton and Sarkar ( 2011 ) exactly by working with their segmented data, this difference is likely due to changes in Moses since the publication of their result
p55
aVFor example, the Arabic noun ¡laldwl¿ lldwl u'\u005cu201c' to the countries u'\u005cu201d' is segmented as l+ u'\u005cu201c' to u'\u005cu201d' Aldwl u'\u005cu201c' the countries u'\u005cu201d'
p56
aVSuch a segmentation can be produced as a byproduct of analysis [ 24 , 2 , 9 ] , or may be produced using an unsupervised morphological segmenter such as Morfessor [ 20 , 7 ]
p57
aVWe consider a phrase to be correct only if it can be found in the reference
p58
aV1) clitical u'\u005cu2013' the two systems agree on a stem, but at least one clitic, often a prefix denoting a preposition or determiner, was dropped, added or replaced; (2) lexical u'\u005cu2013' a word was changed to a morphologically unrelated word with a similar meaning; (3) inflectional u'\u005cu2013' the words have the same stem, but different inflection due to a change in gender, number or verb tense; (4) part-of-speech u'\u005cu2013' the two systems agree on the lemma, but have selected different parts of speech
p59
aVEquation 1 may need to be modified for other languages or segmentation schemes, but our techniques generalize to any definition that can be written as a regular expression
p60
aVFor example, if we removed the edge 2 u'\u005cu2192' 3 ( AlTfl ) from Figure 1 a, then [ 0 u'\u005cu2192' 2 ] ([ b+ lEbp ]) would cease to be a complete chain, but it would still be a valid chain
p61
aVTable 4 breaks down per-phrase accuracy according to four manually-assigned categories
p62
aVLacking stems, they are left segmented
p63
aVFinally, we take the closure of this transducer, so that the resulting machine can transduce any sequence of words
p64
aVIf a morphological feature does not manifest itself as a separate token in the source, then it may be best to leave its corresponding segment attached to the stem
p65
aV5 5 Sentence-initial suffix morphemes and sentence-final prefix morphemes represent a special case that we omit for the sake of brevity
p66
aVMIRA was selected over MERT because we have an in-house implementation that can tune on lattices very quickly
p67
aV7 7 We also experimented on log p ( X
p68
aVWhile this division of labor is useful, the pipeline approach may prevent the desegmenter from recovering from errors made by the decoder
p69
aVWe tune on the NIST 2004 evaluation set (1353 sentences) and evaluate on NIST 2005 (1056 sentences
p70
aV3 3 Throughout this paper, we use u'\u005cu201c' + u'\u005cu201d' to mark morphemes as prefixes or suffixes, as in w+ or +h
p71
aVFor English-to-Arabic, 1-best desegmentation results in a 0.7 BLEU point improvement over training on unsegmented Arabic
p72
aV2008 ) also tune on unsegmented references by simply desegmenting SMT output before MERT collects sufficient statistics for BLEU and translate with both segmented and unsegmented language models for English-to-Finnish translation
p73
aVOur first baseline is Unsegmented , where we train on unsegmented target text, requiring no desegmentation step
p74
aVMoving to lattice desegmentation more than doubles that improvement, resulting in a BLEU score of 34.4 and an improvement of 1.0 BLEU point over 1-best desegmentation
p75
aVLattice desegmentation is a non-local lattice transformation
p76
aVThe unsegmented LM alone yields a 0.4 point improvement over the 1-best desegmentation score
p77
aVThe third indicates two or more discontiguities
p78
aVThey introduce an additional desegmentation technique that augments the table-based approach with an unsegmented language model
p79
aVThis is a natural place to introduce features that describe the desegmentation process, such as scores provided by a desegmentation table, which can be incorporated into the desegmenting transducer u'\u005cu2019' s edge weights
p80
aVX + = = X X *
p81
aVTable 3 compares different combinations of features using lattice desegmentation
p82
aVDesegmentation is the process of converting segmented words into their original surface form
p83
aVA 5-gram LM trained on unsegmented target text is used to assess the fluency of the desegmented word sequence
p84
aV2011 ) , we report average scores over five random tuning replications to account for optimizer instability
p85
aVWe now have a desegmented lattice, but it has not been annotated with an unsegmented (word-level) language model
p86
aVUnlike our work, they replace the segmented language model with the unsegmented one, allowing them to tune the linear model parameters by hand
p87
aVIn this setting, the sparsity reduction from segmentation helps word alignment and target language modeling, but it does not result in a more expressive translation model
p88
aVBojar ( 2007 ) incorporates such analyses into a factored model, to either include a language model over target morphological tags, or model the generation of morphological features
p89
aVThis trivially allows for an unsegmented language model and never makes desegmentation errors
p90
aVOne advantage of our approach is that it allows discontiguous source words to translate into a single target word
p91
aVHowever, when translating into Arabic, the decoder produces segmented output, which must be desegmented to produce readable text
p92
aVHowever, they adopt a scheme of word-boundary-aware morpheme-level phrase extraction, meaning that target phrases include only complete words, though those words are segmented into morphemes
p93
aVTo generate the desegmentation table, we analyze the segmentations from the Arabic side of the parallel training data to collect mappings from morpheme sequences to surface forms
p94
aVWith lattice desegmentation, we need only to have seen AlzrqA u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu201c' blue u'\u005cu201d' and the three morphological pieces of bsyArth for the decoder and desegmenter to assemble the phrase
p95
aVFor English-to-Finnish, the Unsup L-match segmentation with 1-best desegmentation does not improve over the unsegmented baseline
p96
aVLattice desegmentation was able to boost this to 32.9, slightly above 1-best desegmentation, but well below our best MADA desegmentation result of 34.4
p97
aVThe one-best desegmentation approach segments the target language at training time and then desegments the one-best output in post-processing
p98
aVThe desegmentation score would likely be useful in a scenario where we provide multiple desegmentation options to the re-ranker; for now, it indicates only the ambiguity of a fixed choice, and is likely redundant with information provided by the language model
p99
aVFour translation model features encode phrase translation probabilities and lexical scores in both directions
p100
aVOur second baseline is 1-best Deseg , where we train on segmented target text and desegment the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s 1-best output
p101
aVIn fact, even with our lattice desegmenter providing a boost, we are unable to see a significant improvement over the unsegmented model
p102
aVWe use both segmented and unsegmented language models, and tune automatically to optimize BLEU
p103
aVThe decoder u'\u005cu2019' s log-linear model includes a standard feature set
p104
aVLattice desegmentation is significantly better ( p 0.01 ) than 1000 -best desegmentation
p105
aVAdding the desegmentation score to these two feature groups does not improve performance, confirming the results we observed during development
p106
aVThe Arabic table consists of X u'\u005cu2192' Y entries, where X is a target morpheme sequence and Y is a desegmented surface form
p107
aVWhen an X is missing from the table, we fall back on a set of desegmentation rules [ 9 ] and this feature is set to 0
p108
aVWith new features reflecting the desegmented output, we can re-tune our enhanced linear model on a development set
p109
aVOur goal in this work is to benefit from the sparsity-reducing properties of morphological segmentation while simultaneously allowing the system to reason about the final surface forms of the target language
p110
aVAdding contiguity indicators on top of the unsegmented LM results in another 0.6 point improvement
p111
aVInspired by the use of non-local features in forest decoding [ 14 ] , we present an algorithm to find chains of edges that correspond to desegmentable token sequences, allowing lattice desegmentation with no phrase-table restrictions
p112
aVBut it also comes at a substantial cost when target phrases include only complete words, the system can only generate word forms that were seen during training
p113
aVIn order to better understand the source of our improvements in the English-to-Arabic scenario, we conducted an extensive manual analysis of the differences between 1-best and lattice desegmentation on our test set
p114
aVWe desegment a large set of possible decoder outputs by processing n -best lists or lattices, which allows us to consider both the segmented and desegmented output before locking in the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s decision
p115
aVOflazer and Durgar El-Kahlout ( 2007 ) desegment 1000-best lists for English-to-Turkish translation to enable scoring with an unsegmented language model
p116
aVA phrase-based decoder produces its output from left to right, with each operation appending the translation of a source phrase to a growing target hypothesis
p117
aVJudging from the output on the NIST 2005 test set, the system uses these discontiguous desegmentations very rarely only 5% of desegmented tokens align to discontiguous source phrases
p118
aVThe 1000-best Deseg system desegments, augments and re-ranks the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s 1000-best list, while Lattice Deseg does the same in the lattice
p119
aVThe usefulness of a target segmentation depends on its correspondence to the source language
p120
aV1000 -best desegmentation also works well, resulting in a 0.6 BLEU point improvement over 1-best
p121
aVThe majority of differences correspond to clitics, whose correction appears to be a major source of the improvements obtained by lattice desegmentation
p122
aVFor Arabic, morphological segmentation is performed by MADA 3.2 [ 12 ] , using the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) segmentation scheme as recommended by El Kholy and Habash ( 2012
p123
aVThe unsegmented approach translates without segmenting the target
p124
aVThis property is maintained by the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s recombination rules for the segmented LM, but it is not guaranteed for the desegmented LM
p125
aVThe path restriction on complete chains forces words to be bounded by other words in order to be complete
p126
aVThis resolves the sparsity issue, but does not allow the decoder to take into account features of the desegmented target
p127
aVThe segmentation may be addressing issues with model sparsity, but it is also introducing errors that would have been impossible had words been left unsegmented
p128
aV2010 ) tune on unsegmented references, 1 1 Tuning on unsegmented references does not require substantial modifications to the standard SMT pipeline
p129
aVEl Kholy and Habash ( 2012 ) provide an extensive study on the influence of segmentation and desegmentation on English-to-Arabic SMT
p130
aVMorphological segmentation is considered to be indispensable when translating between English and morphologically complex languages such as Arabic
p131
aVIn order to annotate lattice edges with an n -gram LM, every path coming into a node must end with the same sequence of ( n - 1 ) tokens
p132
aV2010 ) address this problem by forcing the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s phrase table to respect word boundaries, guaranteeing that each desegmentable token sequence is local to an edge
p133
aVAlgorithm 3.3 desegments a lattice by finding all complete chains and replacing each one with a single edge
p134
aVA KN-smoothed 5-gram language model is trained on the target side of the parallel data with SRILM [ 29 ]
p135
aVSeveral entries may share the same X , resulting in multiple desegmentation options
p136
aVRe-ranking models are tuned using a batch variant of hope-fear MIRA [ 5 , 4 ] , using the n -best variant for n -best desegmentation, and the lattice variant for lattice desegmentation
p137
aVIn this section, we discuss how a lattice from a multi-stack phrase-based decoder such as Moses [ 17 ] can be desegmented to enable word-level features
p138
aVFurthermore, it becomes substantially more difficult to have non-adjacent source tokens contribute morphemes to a single target word
p139
aVWe then sampled 650 cases where the two sides of the substitution were deemed to be related, and divided these cases into categories based on how the lattice desegmentation differs from the one-best desegmentation
p140
aVThat is, the morphemes forming a word might span several edges, making desegmentation non-trivial
p141
aVThis training set contains about 40 million Arabic tokens before segmentation, and 47 million after segmentation
p142
aVThis transducer must be able to consume every word in our lattice u'\u005cu2019' s output vocabulary
p143
aVMany languages have access to morphological analyzers, which annotate surface forms with their lemmas and morphological features
p144
aVThe second most common category is lexical, where the unsegmented LM has drastically altered the choice of translation
p145
aVIn this work, we show that it is possible to maintain the sparsity-reducing benefit of segmentation while translating directly into unsegmented text
p146
aVWe can then transform that table into a finite state transducer with one path per table entry
p147
aVThis algorithm can be seen as implicitly constructing a customized desegmenting transducer and composing it with the input lattice on the fly
p148
aVOur re-ranker has access to all of the features used by the decoder, in addition to a number of features enabled by desegmentation
p149
aVNote that tokens requiring no desegmentation simply emit themselves
p150
aV2008 ) present two Arabic desegmentation schemes table-based and rule-based
p151
aVBoth the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s log-linear model and the re-ranking models are trained on the same development set
p152
aVFinally, we include word and phrase penalties
p153
aVProgrammatic composition of a lattice with an n -gram LM acceptor is a well understood problem
p154
aVThe transformation might take the form of a morphological analysis or a morphological segmentation
p155
aVThe two obvious baseline approaches each decode using one view of the target language
p156
aVThese results match the established state-of-the-art on this data set, but also indicate that there is still room for improvement in identifying the best segmentation strategy for English-to-Finnish translation
p157
aVIt maintains a work list of nodes that lie on the boundary between words, and for each node on this list, it launches a depth first search to find all complete chains extending from it
p158
aVStarting from the system that produced 1-best Deseg, we then output either 1000-best lists or lattices to create our two experimental systems
p159
aVThis is done to reduce sparsity and to improve correspondence with the source language (usually English
p160
aV2013 ) replace rule-based desegmentation with a discriminatively-trained character transducer
p161
aVHowever, more complex segmentations, such as the Arabic tokenization provided by MADA [ 12 ] , require further orthographic adjustments to reverse normalizations performed during segmentation
p162
aVThis enables full decoder integration, where we do n -best and lattice re-ranking
p163
aVIn its most natural form, such an acceptor emits target phrases on each edge, but it can easily be transformed into a form with one edge per token, as shown in Figure 1 a
p164
aVFor Finnish, we adopt the Unsup L-match segmentation technique of Clifton and Sarkar ( 2011 ) , which uses Morfessor [ 8 ] to analyze the 5,000 most frequent Finnish words
p165
aVWith each node corresponding to a single LM context, annotation of outgoing edges with n -gram LM scores is straightforward
p166
aVWith word-boundary-aware phrase extraction, a phrase pair containing all of u'\u005cu201c' with his blue car u'\u005cu201d' must have been seen in the parallel data to translate the phrase correctly at test time
p167
aVHowever, it suffers from data sparsity and poor token-to-token correspondence with the source language
p168
aVPrevious work that has tuned on unsegmented references has reported mixed results [ 2 , 20 ]
p169
aVThe decoder u'\u005cu2019' s log-linear model is tuned with MERT [ 23 ]
p170
aVThe analysis is then applied to the Finnish side of the parallel text, and a list of segmented suffixes is collected
p171
aVIn all scenarios, both 1000 -best Deseg and Lattice Deseg significantly outperform the 1-best Deseg baseline ( p 0.01
p172
aVAn input morpheme lattice is a triple u'\u005cu27e8' n s , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca9' , u'\u005cu2130' u'\u005cu27e9' , where u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca9' is a set of nodes, u'\u005cu2130' is a set of edges, and n s u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca9' is the start node that begins each path through the lattice
p173
aVWe train our English-to-Arabic system using 1.49 million sentence pairs drawn from the NIST 2012 training set, excluding the UN data
p174
aVThe decoder uses the default parameters for English-to-Arabic, except that the maximum phrase length is set to 8
p175
aVAs anticipated, the tuner assigns negative weights to discontiguous cases, encouraging the re-ranker to select a safer translation path when possible
p176
aVWe augment n -best lists and lattices using the features described in Section 3.4
p177
aVIf this property does not hold, then nodes must be split until it does
p178
aV4 4 Or the LM composition can be done dynamically, effectively decoding the lattice with a beam or cube-pruned search [ 13 ]
p179
aVNote that although this algorithm creates completely new edges, the resulting node set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca9' u'\u005cu2032' will be a subset of the input node set u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca9'
p180
aVTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to go beyond one-best desegmentation for English-to-Arabic translation
p181
aVSeven distortion features encode a standard distortion penalty as well as a bidirectional lexicalized reordering model
p182
aVFor example, when translating u'\u005cu201c' with his blue car u'\u005cu201d' into the Arabic ¡bsyArth alzrqA u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2014' ¿ bsyArth AlzrqA u'\u005cu2019' , the target word bsyArth is composed of three tokens b+ u'\u005cu201c' with u'\u005cu201d' , syArp u'\u005cu201c' car u'\u005cu201d' and +h u'\u005cu201c' his u'\u005cu201d'
p183
aVInstead of using a tool kit such as OpenFst [ 1 ] , we implement both the desegmenting transducer and the LM acceptor programmatically
p184
aVIn this scenario, there is no right desegmentation; the post-processor has been dealt a losing hand
p185
aVIt also includes the frequent cases involving the nominal determiner prefix Al u'\u005cu201c' the u'\u005cu201d' (left unsegmented by the PATB scheme), and the sentence-initial conjunction w+ u'\u005cu201c' and u'\u005cu201d'
p186
aVTranslation continues until each source word has been covered exactly once [ 19 ]
p187
aVThere appears to be a large advantage to using MADA u'\u005cu2019' s supervised segmentation in this scenario
p188
aVFor each case covering a single phrasal difference, we compare the phrases from each system to the reference
p189
aVThis eliminates the need to construct intermediate machines, such as the lattice-specific desegmenter in Figure 1 b, and facilitates working with edges annotated with feature vectors as opposed to single weights
p190
aVIn this work, we adopt the Table+Rules approach of El Kholy and Habash ( 2012 ) for English-Arabic, while concatenation is sufficient for English-Finnish
p191
aVThe desegmenting transducer for our running example is shown in Figure 1 b
p192
aVAn n -best list reflects a tiny portion of a decoder u'\u005cu2019' s search space, typically fixed at 1000 hypotheses
p193
aVFollowing previous work, we will desegment 1000-best lists [ 24 ]
p194
aVWe evaluate our system using BLEU [ 25 ] and TER [ 28 ]
p195
aVIn particular, it could address issues with translation length mismatch
p196
aVLattices are pruned to a density of 50 edges per word before re-ranking
p197
aVThe remaining categories show no major advantage for either system

aVA number of studies have looked into what granularity of segmentation is best suited for a particular language pair [ 24 , 2 , 7 , 9 ]
p205
aVWe compared the output of the two systems using the Unix tool wdiff , which transforms a solution to the longest-common-subsequence problem into a sequence of multi-word insertions and deletions [ 15 ]
p206
aVOur English-to-Finnish system is trained on the same Europarl corpus as Luong et al
p207
aVWe conducted an ablation experiment on English-to-Arabic to measure the impact of the various features described in Section 3.4

p215
aVBy inspection of Equation 1 , this can only happen when a prefix or stem follows a stem or suffix, which always marks a word boundary
p216
aVTranslating into morphologically complex languages is a challenging and interesting task that has received much recent attention
p217
aVWe align the parallel data with GIZA++ [ 22 ] and decode using Moses [ 17 ]
p218
aVWe use a dynamic program to enumerate all ( n - 1 ) -word contexts leading into a node, and then split the node into multiple copies, one for each context
p219
aVWe measure statistical significance using MultEval [ 6 ] , which implements a stratified approximate randomization test to account for multiple tuning replications
