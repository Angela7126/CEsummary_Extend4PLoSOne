<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Starting from very few seed words (for example, just one seed word), we can extract lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words; the extracted lexical patterns can be further used in finding more new words, and the most probable new words can be added into the seed word set for the next iteration; and the process can be run iteratively until a stop condition is met</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The algorithm works as follows starting from very few seed words (for example, a word in Table 1 ), the algorithm can find lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words in which the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to quantify the degree of association</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We investigate the problem of polarity prediction of new sentiment word and demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment word benefits sentiment classification tasks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We design several measures to quantify the possibility of a candidate word being a new word, and the top-ranked words will be added into the seed word set for the next iteration</a>
