<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an edge over annotation projection in those cases where the amount of parallel data available is limited</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant</a>
