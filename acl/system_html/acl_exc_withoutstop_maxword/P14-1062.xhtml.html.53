<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, the second layer is obtained by applying a convolution to the sentence matrix u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' itself</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Concretely, we think of u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' as the input sentence and u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' i u'\u2208' u'\u211d' is a single feature value associated with the i -th word in the sentence</a>
