<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Content selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in a summary</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Here, we propose an alternative method that tackles the challenge of interdependent data by using multi-label (ML) classification, which is efficient in taking data dependencies into account and generating a set of labels (in our case templates) simultaneously []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ensemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>ML classification achieved significantly higher accuracy, which was expected as it is a supervised learning method</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Content is regarded as labels (each template represents a label) and thus the task can be thought of as a classification problem</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>RAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>RL is trained to optimise for this function, and therefore it achieves higher reward, whereas ML is trained to learn by examples, therefore it produces output closer to the gold standard (lecturer u'\u2019' s produced summaries</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The reduced accuracy of the classification with predicted history is due to the error in the predicted values</a>
