<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because reading 300 articles per topic is impractical, we asked AMT workers to read a Wikipedia article on the same topic and then identify the three most important events and the five most important secondary events</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The problem of hierarchical summarization as described in Section 2 has all of the requirements of MDS, and additional complexities of inducing a hierarchical structure, processing an order of magnitude bigger input, generating a much larger output, and enforcing coherence between parent and child summaries</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since Summa was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1 , it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those</a>
