<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We extract hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations in the Baidubaike corpus, which is also used to train word embeddings (Section 4.1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We are greatly interested in the practical performance of the proposed method on the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations outside of CilinE</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
