aVTable 2 shows the segmentation scores our model achieves when evaluated on the three test sets, as well as the results for MADA and MADA-ARZ
p2
aVOur segmenter achieves higher scores than MADA and MADA-ARZ on all datasets under both evaluation metrics
p3
aVIn addition, our segmenter is faster than MADA
p4
aVOur segmenter achieves a 95.1% F 1 segmentation score evaluated against a gold standard on Egyptian dialect data, compared to 90.8% for MADA-ARZ and 92.9% for Green and DeNero
