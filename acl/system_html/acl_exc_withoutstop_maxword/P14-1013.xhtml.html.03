<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we explain our neural network based topic similarity model in detail, as well as how to incorporate the topic similarity features into SMT decoding procedure</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In our work, a novel neural network based approach is proposed to infer topic representations for parallel data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The learned neural networks are used to obtain sentence topic representations, which will be further leveraged to infer topic representations of bilingual translation rules</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These topic-related documents are utilized to learn a specific topic representation for each sentence using a neural network based approach</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We directly optimized bilingual topic similarity in the deep learning framework with the help of sentence-level parallel data, so that the learned representation could be easily used in SMT decoding procedure</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We integrate topic similarity features in the log-linear model and evaluate the performance on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation task</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
