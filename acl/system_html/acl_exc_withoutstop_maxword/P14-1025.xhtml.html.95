<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The authors evaluated their method in terms of wsd accuracy over a given corpus, based on assigning all instances of a target word with the predominant sense learned from that corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Such an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions u'\u2014' and predominant senses too u'\u2014' vary from corpus to corpus</a>
