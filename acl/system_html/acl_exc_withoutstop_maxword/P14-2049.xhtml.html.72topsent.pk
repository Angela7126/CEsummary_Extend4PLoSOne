VAll the systems show degraded nearest neighbor quality as target words grow rare, but at lower ranks, the u'\u005cu0391' = .04 nearest neighbor system fares considerably better than the symmetric u'\u005cu0391' = .50 system; the line across the bottom tracks the score of a system with randomly generated nearest neighbors
