<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Work on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this section, we describe our various strategies for desegmenting the SMT system u'\u2019' s output space, along with the features that we add to take advantage of this desegmented view</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our goal is to desegment the decoder u'\u2019' s output lattice, and in doing so, gain access to a compact, desegmented view of a large portion of the translation search space</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finnish does not require a table, as all words can be desegmented with simple concatenation</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Fortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously</a>
