VTo investigate all types of social relationships between Twitter users and construct Twitter social graphs we collect lists of followers and friends, and extract user mentions, hashtags, replies and retweets from communications
p1
aVSimilar to the candidate-centric graph, for each user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample user social circles in the Fall of 2012
p2
aVFor each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles
p3
aVSharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u005cu2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest
p4
aV[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features
p5
aVIn this paper, we study different types of user social circles in addition to a friend network
p6
aVWe compare our static neighbor and user models using the cost functions from Eq
p7
aVWe rely on communications from four types of neighbors such as friends, followers, retweets and user mentions
