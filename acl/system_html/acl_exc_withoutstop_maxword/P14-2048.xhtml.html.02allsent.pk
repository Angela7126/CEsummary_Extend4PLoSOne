VSeveral works [] used text classification techniques in order to distinguish human translated text from native language text at document or paragraph level, using features like word and POS n-grams, proportion of grammatical words in the text, nouns, finite verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs, numerals, pronouns, prepositions, determiners, conjunctions etc
p1
aVRegarding the detection of machine translated text, Carter and Inkpen [] translated the Hansards of the 36th Parliament of Canada using the Microsoft Bing MT web service, and conducted three detection experiments at document level, using unigrams, average token length, and type-token ratio as features
p2
aVArase and Zhou [] trained a sentence-level classifier to distinguish machine translated text from human generated text on English and Japanese web-page corpora, translated by Google Translate, Bing and an in-house SMT system
p3
aVUsing simple linear regression, we also obtain an R 2 value (coefficient of determination) over the measurements of detection accuracy and BLEU score, for each of three feature set combinations (function words, POS tags and mixed) and the two data combinations (MT vs reference and MT vs non reference sentences
p4
aVUsing automatic text classification methods in the field of translation studies had many use cases in recent years, mainly as an empirical method of measuring, proving or contradicting translation universals
p5
aVThe recent success and proliferation of statistical machine translation (MT) systems raise a number of important questions
p6
aVIn the first experiment set, we explore the ability to detect outputs of machine translated text from different MT systems, in an environment containing both human generated and machine translated text
p7
aVFurther work might include applying our methods to other language pairs and domains, acquiring word-level quality estimation or integrating our method in a machine translation system
p8
aVWhile Arase and Zhou [] considered MT detection at sentence level, as we do in this paper, they did not study the correlation between the translation quality of the machine translated text and the ability to detect it
p9
aVFurthermore, additional features and feature selection techniques can be applied, both for improving detection accuracy and for strengthening the correlation with human quality estimation
p10
aVTo verify this intuition, we create parse trees using the Berkeley parser [] and extract the one-level CFG rules as features
p11
aVFor purposes of classification, we use the same content independent features as in the previous experiment, based on function words and POS tags, again with SMO-based SVM as the classifier
p12
aVIn the second experiment set, we test our detection method on SMT systems we created, in which we have control over the training data and the expected overall relative translation quality
p13
aVGoogle Translate, Systran, and five other commercial MT systems available at the http://itranslate4.eu website, which enables to query example MT systems built by several european MT companies
p14
aVIn the third section, we describe experiments regarding the detection of machine translation and in the fourth section we discuss the use of detection techniques as a machine translation quality estimation method
p15
aVWe note that the second leftmost point in Figures 3 , 4 is an outlier that is, our method has a hard time detecting sentences produced by this system although it is not highly rated by human evaluators
p16
aVAs our learning algorithm we use SVM with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), taken from the WEKA machine learning toolkit []
p17
aVKoppel and Ordan [] classified texts to original or translated, using a list of 300 function words taken from LIWC [] as features
p18
aVTo provide another measure of correlation, we compared every pair of data points in the experiment to get the proportion of pairs ordered identically by the human evaluators and our method, with a result of 0.846 (66 of 78
p19
aVWe have shown that it is possible to detect machine translation from monolingual corpora containing both machine translated text and human generated text, at sentence level
p20
aVTo train the systems, we take a portion of the Europarl corpus [] , creating 7 different SMT systems, each using a different amount of training data, for both the translation model and language model
p21
aVSpecifically, given a corpus consisting of both machine-translated English text (English being the target language) and native English text (not necessarily the reference translation of the machine-translated text), we measure the accuracy of the system in classifying the sentences in the corpus as machine-translated or not
p22
aVThe differences between native and translated texts found there go well beyond systematic translation errors and point to a distinct u'\u005cu201d' Translationese u'\u005cu201d' dialect
p23
aVDue to the sparseness of the data at the sentence level, we use common content-independent linguistic features for the classification task
p24
aVIn the final section we offer conclusions and suggestions for future work
p25
aVWe conduct the same classification experiment as above, with features based on function words and POS tags, and SMO-based SVM as the classifier
p26
aVThis research was funded in part by the Intel Collaborative Research Institute for Computational Intelligence
p27
aVUsing these features alone, without the FW and POS tag based features presented above, we obtain an R 2 = 0.829 with a proportion of identically ordered pairs at 0.923 (72 of 78), as shown in Figure 5
p28
aVOur features are binary, denoting the presence or absence of each of a set of part-of-speech n-grams acquired using the Stanford POS tagger [] , as well as the presence or absence of each of 467 function words taken from LIWC []
p29
aVAfter translating the sentences, we take 20,000 sentences from each engine output and conduct the detection experiment by labeling those sentences as MT sentences, and another 20,000 sentences, which are the human reference translations, labeled as reference sentences
p30
aVFor this task, we use a portion of the Canadian Hansard corpus [] , containing 48,914 parallel sentences from French to English
p31
aVAgain, we represent each sentence as a boolean vector, in which each entry represents the presence or absence of the CFG rule in the parse-tree of the sentence
p32
aVWe first use 3000 reference sentences from the WMT13 u'\u005cu2019' English reference translations, against the matching 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment
p33
aVIn the second experiment, we use 3000 random, non reference sentences from the newstest 2011-2012 corpora published in WMT12 u'\u005cu2019' [] against 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, again resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment
p34
aVProminent among these are how to evaluate the quality of such a system efficiently and how to detect the output of such systems (for example, to avoid using it circularly as input for refining MT systems
p35
aVThere is a strong correlation between the detection accuracy that can be obtained and the BLEU score or the human evaluation score of the machine translation itself
p36
aVFirst, we will show that using style-related linguistic features, such as frequencies of parts-of-speech n-grams and function words, it is possible to learn classifiers that distinguish machine-translated text from human-translated or native English text
p37
aVIn fact, results are linearly and negatively correlated with BLEU, as can be seen both on commercial systems and our in-house SMT systems
p38
aVIn Figure 1 , we show the relationship of the observed detection accuracy for each system with the BLEU score of that system
p39
aVThis accuracy will be shown to decrease as the quality of the underlying MT system increases
p40
aV[] also tested various hypotheses regarding u'\u005cu201d' Translationese u'\u005cu201d' , using 32 different linguistically-informed features, to assess the degree to which different sets of features can distinguish between translated and original texts
p41
aVFor data, we use 20,000 random, non reference sentences from the Hansard corpus, against 20,000 sentences from one MT system per experiment, again resulting in 40,000 sentence instances per experiment
p42
aVWe will see that the success of such classifiers are strongly correlated with the quality of the underlying machine translation system
p43
aVIn fact, the correlation is strong enough that we propose that this accuracy measure itself can be used as a measure of MT system quality, obviating the need for a reference corpus, as for example is necessary for BLEU []
p44
aVWhile applying the same classification method as with the reference sentences, the detection accuracy rises, while the correlation with the translation quality yields R 2 = 0.556 , as can be seen in Figure 4
p45
aVWe examine this detection accuracy vs quality correlation, with various MT systems, such as rule-based and statistical MT, both commercial and in-house, using various feature sets
p46
aVThis point represents the Joshua [] SMT system
p47
aVThey achieved very high detection accuracy using application-specific feature sets for this purpose, including indicators of the u'\u005cu201d' Phrase Salad u'\u005cu201d' [] phenomenon or u'\u005cu201d' Gappy-Phrases u'\u005cu201d' []
p48
aVWe consider only those entries that appear at least ten times in the entire corpus, in order to reduce sparsity in the data
p49
aVThe relationship between the detection results for each MT system and the BLEU score for that system, resulting in R 2 = 0.774 , is shown in Figure 2
p50
aVThe special features of translated texts have been studied widely for many years
p51
aVAs is evident, regardless of the feature set or non-MT sentences used, the correlation between detection accuracy and BLEU score is very high, as we can also see from the R 2 values in Table 1
p52
aVWe would like to thank Noam Ordan and Shuly Wintner for their help and feedback on the early stages of this work
p53
aVThis system is syntax-based, which apparently confound our POS and FW-based classifier, despite it u'\u005cu2019' s low human evaluation score
p54
aVAs can be seen in Figure 3 , the detection accuracy is strongly correlated with the evaluations scores, yielding R 2 = 0.774
p55
aVAs can be seen, best detection results are obtained using the full combined feature set
p56
aVAttempts to define their characteristics, often called u'\u005cu201d' Translation Universals u'\u005cu201d' , include []
p57
aVThis suggests that our method might be used as an unsupervised quality estimation method when no reference sentences are available, such as for resource-poor source languages
p58
aVIn the next section, we review previous related work
p59
aVAs can be seen in the above experiments, there is a strong correlation between the BLEU score and the MT detection accuracy of our method
p60
aVIn order to do so, we use the Moses statistical machine translation toolkit []
p61
aVTo do this, we use the French-English data from the 8th Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation - WMT13 u'\u005cu2019' [] , containing outputs from 13 different MT systems and their human evaluations
p62
aVWe wish to distinguish machine translated English sentences from either human-translated sentences or native English sentences
p63
aVWe translate the French portion of the corpus using several MT systems, respectively
p64
aVWe also wish to consider the relationship between detection accuracy and a human quality estimation score
p65
aVWe do this in order to create different quality translation systems, details of which are described in Table 3
p66
aVWhile this is a straightforward and not entirely novel result, our main contribution is to relativize the result
p67
aVWe conduct a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the entire 40,000 sentence corpus
p68
aVWe hypothesize that the use of syntax-based features might improve results
p69
aVWe also conduct the same experiment using 20,000 random, non-reference sentences from the same corpus, instead of the reference sentences
p70
aVThe detection and R 2 results are shown in Table 1
p71
aVIt can also be seen that, as might be expected, it is easier to distinguish machine-translated sentences from a non-reference set than from the reference set
p72
aVThis correlation holds whether or not a reference set is used
p73
aVIn this paper, we will answer both these questions
p74
aVHere, the proportion of identically ordered pairs is 0.782 (61 of 78
p75
aVWe show below that such detection is possible with very high accuracy only on low-quality translations
