<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is borne out by their model (not shown in Table 7 ) that omits the argument-argument relative position feature and solely relies on verb-argument position, which achieves up to 70% accuracy in intransitive settings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the intransitive case, however, whereas the model presented in this paper is generally able to successfully label the lone noun as the subject, the model of chooses to label lone nouns as objects about 40% of the time</a>
