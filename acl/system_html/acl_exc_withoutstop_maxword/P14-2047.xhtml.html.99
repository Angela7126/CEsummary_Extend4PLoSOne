<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes a source sentence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Next we examine if sentence u'\u2013' discourse divergence between languages and the presence of (ambiguous) discourse connectives would be more indicative of the expected translation quality</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit expression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e.,, if the source segment is translated into one or multiple sentences in English, since discourse relations between adjacent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-sentence ones</a>
