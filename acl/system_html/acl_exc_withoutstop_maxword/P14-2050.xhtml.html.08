<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Previous work on neural word embeddings take the contexts of a word to be its linear context u'\u2013' words that precede and follow the target word, typically in a window of k tokens to each side</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We modified word2vec to support arbitrary contexts, and to output the context embeddings in addition to the word embeddings</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This dataset contains pairs of similar words that reflect either relatedness (topical similarity) or similarity (functional similarity) relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this work, we generalize the SkipGram model, and move from linear bag-of-words contexts to arbitrary word contexts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Intuitively, words that appear in similar contexts should have similar embeddings, though we have not yet found a formal proof that SkipGram does indeed maximize the dot product of similar words</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield</a>
