<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment events from tweets by aggregating information across multiple messages [ 1 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial step since the results would directly impact the final extracted 4-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , l , k u'\u27e9'</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Events extracted in our proposed framework are represented as a 4-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , l , k u'\u27e9' , where y stands for a non-location named entity, d for a date, l for a location, and k for an event-related keyword</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As illustrated in Figure 1 , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing</a>
