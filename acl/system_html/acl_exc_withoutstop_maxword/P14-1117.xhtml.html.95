<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Multiple approaches to generate good approximate solutions for joint multi-structure compression, based on Lagrangian relaxation to enforce equality between the sequential and syntactic inference subproblems</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As discussed in 2.4 , a maximum spanning tree is recovered from the output of the LP and greedily pruned in order to generate a valid integral solution while observing the imposed compression rate</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, we can recover approximate solutions to this</a>
