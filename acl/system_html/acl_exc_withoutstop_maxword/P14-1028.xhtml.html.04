<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Assuming we are at the i -th character of a sentence, besides the character embeddings, the tag embeddings of the previous tags are also considered 1 1 We also tried the architecture in which the tag embedding of current tag is also considered, but this did not bring much improvement and runs slower</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u2208' T to tag j u'\u2208' T</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Despite tensor-based transformation being effective for capturing the interactions, introducing tensor-based transformation into neural network models to solve sequence labeling task is time prohibitive since</a>
