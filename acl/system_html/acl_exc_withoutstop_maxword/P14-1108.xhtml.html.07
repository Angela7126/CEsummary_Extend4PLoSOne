<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To this end we use text corpora, split them into test and training data, build language models as well as generalized language models over the training data and apply them on the test data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a baseline for our generalized language model (GLM) we have trained standard language models using modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing (MKN</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Modified Kneser-Ney implements smoothing by interpolating between higher and lower order n -gram language models</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Interpolation with lower order models is motivated by the problem of data sparsity in higher order models</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The data set unseen consists of all test sequences which have never been observed in the training data</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then we trained a generalized language model as well as a standard language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on each of these</a>
