<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Then, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on the best results in the above evaluations, we induced semantic frames using slot-word pair features, and then induced verb classes using slot-only features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>induce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this paper, we propose a two-step approach for inducing semantic frames and verb classes</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>apply clustering to the initial frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ] to produce verb-specific semantic frames</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We can use exactly the same clustering method as</a>
