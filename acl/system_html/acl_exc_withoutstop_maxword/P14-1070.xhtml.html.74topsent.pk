VSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs
p1
aVTo define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to our linguistic knowledge
p2
aVIn some experiments, we make use of alternative representations, which we refer later as u'\u005cu201c' labeled representation u'\u005cu201d' , in which the MWE features are incorporated in the dependency labels, so that MWE composition and/or the POS of the MWE be totally contained in
