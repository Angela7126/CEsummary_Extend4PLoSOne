VOur experiments rely on two kinds of data sets i) Monolingual Treebanks with consistent annotation schema u'\u005cu2014' English treebank is used to train the English parsing model, and the Treebanks for target languages are used to evaluate the parsing performance of our approach ii) Large amounts of parallel text with English on one side
p1
aVCentral to our approach is a maximizing likelihood learning framework, in which we use an English parser and parallel text to estimate the u'\u005cu201c' transferring distribution u'\u005cu201d' of the target language parsing model (See Section 2.2 for more details
p2
aVWe train our parsing model with different numbers of parallel sentences to analyze the influence of the amount of parallel data on the parsing performance of our approach
p3
aVHowever, most bilingual text parsing approaches require bilingual treebanks
