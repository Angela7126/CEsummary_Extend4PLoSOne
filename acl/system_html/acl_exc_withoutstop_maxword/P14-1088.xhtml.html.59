<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The data studied in this work has previously been used by \citeN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by \citeN Fournier13</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore we remove the leaf nodes in the case of phrase structure trees, and in the case of dependency trees we compare trees whose edges are unlabelled and nodes are labelled with the dependency relation between that word and its head; the root node receives the label u'\u0395'</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The definitive reference for agreement measures in computational linguistics is \citeN Art:Poe08, who argue forcefully in favour of the use of chance-corrected measures of agreement over simple accuracy measures</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Instead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' [] and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A method for perturbing phrase structure trees would also be interesting, as this would allow us to repeat the synthetic experiments performed here using phrase structure corpora to compare the behaviour of the metrics on the two types of corpus</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Tree edit distance has previously been used in the TedEval software [] for parser evaluation agnostic to both annotation scheme and theoretical framework, but this by itself is still an uncorrected accuracy measure and thus unsuitable for our purposes</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This is due to a mismatch between the formulation of the agreement measures, which assumes that the annotations have no or relatively little internal structure, and syntactic annotation where structure is the entire point of the annotation</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The difference between the u'\u0391' metrics and the Jaccard similarity is larger than the difference between u'\u0391' and LAS for our dependency corpora, however the two similarity metrics are not comparable, and it is well known that for phrase structures single disagreements such as a PP-attachment disagreement can result in</a>
