<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Then, for each dataset, for rejuvenation disabled, rejuvenation based on a reservoir of size 1000, and rejuvenation based on the entire history (in turn), we perform 30 runs of the particle filter from that fixed initial model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results, shown in Figure 3 , show that we can ameliorate the variance due to initialization by tuning the initial model to NMI or perplexity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We observed previously that variance in the Gibbs initialization of the model contributes significantly to variance of the overall algorithm, as measured by NMI</a>
