VFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p1
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p2
aVIn contrast, we define sentence skeleton as the key segments of a sentence and develop a new MT approach based on this information
p3
aVCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p4
aVWe chose the default feature set
