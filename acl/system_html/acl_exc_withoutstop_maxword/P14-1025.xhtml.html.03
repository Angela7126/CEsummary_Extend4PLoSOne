<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Such an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions u'\u2014' and predominant senses too u'\u2014' vary from corpus to corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that we do not consider high-frequency senses with frequency higher than 0.6, as it is rare for a medium- to high-frequency word to take on a novel sense which is then the predominant sense in a given corpus</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A natural question to ask is whether our method can be used to predict word senses that are missing from our sense inventory, and identify usages associated with each such missing sense</a>
