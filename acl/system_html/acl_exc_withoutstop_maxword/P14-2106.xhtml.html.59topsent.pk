(lp0
VOn the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors
p1
aVSubsection 4.1 presented the results of the base algorithms and their extensions based on semantic features report improvements over the best single parser when combining three transition-based models and one graph-based model
p2
aVWe will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags
p3
aVWe firstly tested the addition of each individual semantic feature to each parser, evaluating its
