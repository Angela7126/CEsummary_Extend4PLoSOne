<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The algorithm in Wilson ( 1996 ) iterates over all the nodes, and for each node performs a random walk according to the weights w i u'\u2062' j until the walk creates a loop or hits a tree</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is feasible if we restrict the proposed moves to only small changes in the current tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Reranking can be combined with an arbitrary scoring function, and thus can easily incorporate global features over the entire parse tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We find a high scoring tree through sampling, and (later) learn the parameters u'\u0398' so as to further guide this process</a>
