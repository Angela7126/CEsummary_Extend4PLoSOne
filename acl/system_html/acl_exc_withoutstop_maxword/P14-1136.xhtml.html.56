<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus for this context function, the block cardinality k was the sum of the number of scanned gold dependency path types and the number of dependency labels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given a predicate in its sentential context, we therefore extract only those context words that appear in positions warranted by the above set</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Consequently, the Wsabie Embedding model can share more information between different examples in the training data than the Log-Linear Embedding model</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We believe that the Wsabie Embedding model performs better than the Log-Linear Embedding baseline (that uses the same input</a>
