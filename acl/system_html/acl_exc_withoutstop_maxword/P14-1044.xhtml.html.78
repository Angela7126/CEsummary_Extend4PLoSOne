<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, we assume that a lexical resource L can be represented as an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) where V is the set of nodes, i.e.,, the concepts defined in the resource, and E is the set of undirected edges, i.e.,, semantic relations between concepts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources [ 27 , 12 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm</a>
