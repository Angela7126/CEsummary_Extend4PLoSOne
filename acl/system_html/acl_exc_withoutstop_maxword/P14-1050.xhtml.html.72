<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our algorithm is in spirit to double propagation [ 15 ] , however, the differences are apparent in that firstly, we use very lightweight linguistic information (except POS tags); secondly, our major contributions are to propose statistical measures to address the following key issues first, to measure the utility of lexical patterns; second, to measure the possibility of a candidate word being a new word</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Typical models include conditional random fields proposed by [ 14 ] , and a joint model trained with adaptive online gradient descent based on feature frequency information [ 18 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Automatic extraction of new words is indispensable to many tasks such as Chinese word segmentation, machine translation, named entity extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The algorithm works as follows starting from very few seed words (for example, a word in Table 1 ), the algorithm can find lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words in which the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to quantify the degree of association</a>
