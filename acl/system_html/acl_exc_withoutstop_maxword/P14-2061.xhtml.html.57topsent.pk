VGiven the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows
p1
aVThis accuracy is so high that current research has shifted to related more challenging problems language variety identification [ 26 ] , native language identification [ 24 ] and identification at the extremes of scales; many more languages, smaller training data, shorter document lengths [ 1 ]
p2
aVPart of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers
p3
aVFor example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background
p4
aVWe call both the centroids and filters as the learned features
p5
aVThere is evidence that normalization and whitening [ 13 ] improve performance in unsupervised feature learning [ 4 ]
p6
aVThe same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions in the lexicon these too make sign languages across the world very similar
