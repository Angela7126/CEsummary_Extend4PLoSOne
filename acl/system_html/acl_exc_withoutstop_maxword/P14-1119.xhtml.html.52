<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An evaluation error occurs when a system outputs a candidate that is semantically equivalent to a gold keyphrase, but is considered erroneous by a scoring program because of its failure to recognize that the predicted phrase and the corresponding gold keyphrase are semantically equivalent</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This pairwise ranking approach therefore introduces competition between candidate keyphrases, and has been shown to significantly outperform KEA [ 56 , 12 ] , a popular supervised baseline that adopts the traditional supervised classification approach [ 46 , 23 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While empirical results show that KeyCluster performs better than both TextRank and Hulth u'\u2019' s [ 20 ] supervised system, KeyCluster has a potential drawback by extracting keyphrases from each topic cluster, it essentially gives</a>
