<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u2018' birth cluster u'\u2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We did this evaluation for the candidate birth, join and split sense clusters obtained by comparing 1909-1953 time period with respect to 2002-2005</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For our evaluation, we developed an aligner to align the word clusters obtained with WordNet senses</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time periods</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Table 3 shows the evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to birth</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Table 1 gives a lot of candidate words for sense change</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Table 4 shows the corresponding evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to split or join</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Table 6 shows some of the words for which the evaluation detected success along with WordNet senses</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Clearly, the cluster words correspond to a newer sense for these words and the mapped WordNet synset matches the birth cluster to a very high degree</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The algorithm detected a lot of candidate words for the cases of birth, split/join as well as death</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In addition to manual evaluation, we also performed automated evaluation for the candidate words</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In summary, the aligner tool takes as input the CW cluster and returns a WordNet synset id that corresponds to the cluster words</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For the join case, we find WordNet synset ids s 1 and s 2 for the clusters obtained in the source time period and s n u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' w for the join cluster in the target time period</a>
