VThe summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students
p1
aVML system, RL system, Rule-based and Random system
p2
aVThe RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification
p3
aVFirstly, we performed a preliminary evaluation on classification methods, comparing our proposed ML classification with multiple iterated classification approaches
p4
aVAlgorithm adaptation approaches [] extend simple classification methods to handle ML data
p5
aVWe compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users
p6
aVProblem transformation approaches [] transform the ML classification task into one or more simple classification tasks
p7
aVThe rule-based system and the RL system have lower accuracy compared to the ML system
p8
aVRAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []
p9
aVThe RL system differs from the classification system in the way it performs content selection
p10
aVML classification algorithms have been divided into three categories algorithm adaptation methods, problem transformation and ensemble methods []
p11
aVML classification achieved significantly higher accuracy, which was expected as it is a supervised learning method
p12
aVEnsemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods
p13
aVRAkEL tackles this problem by constructing an ensemble of LP classifiers and training each one on a different random subset of the set of labels []
p14
aVThe LP method transforms the ML task, into one single-label multi-class classification task, where the possible set of predicted variables for
