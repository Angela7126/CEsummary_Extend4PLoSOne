VIn our pipeline we aim at higher recall, since we later filter sentences and aggregate them to generate new abstract sentences
p1
aVThis means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content
p2
aVWe also show the results of the version we use in our pipeline (our pipeline extractive system
p3
aVExtractive our full query-based abstractive summariztion system show statistically significant improvements over baselines and other pure extractive summarization systems for ROUGE-1 4 4 The statistical significance tests was calculated by approximate randomization, as described in [ 31 ]
p4
aVAs a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]
p5
aVMoreover, we compare our abstractive system with the first part of our framework (utterance extraction in Figure 1), which can be presented as an extractive query-based summarization system (our extractive system
p6
aV1) To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first abstractive system that generates summaries based on usersâ€™ phrasal queries, instead of well-formed questions
p7
aVIn other words, using our extractive model described in section 2.1, as a stand alone system, is an effective query-based extractive summarization model
p8
aVTo address such limitations, we propose a fully automatic unsupervised abstract generation framework based on phrasal queries for multimodal conversation summarization
p9
aVMoreover, this step, stand alone, corresponds to an extractive summarization system
p10
aVTo achieve this, the most relevant (summary-worthy) utterances that we select are the ones that maximize the coverage of such terms
p11
aVIn this section, we show the evaluation results of our proposed framework and its comparison to the baselines and a state-of-the-art query-focused extractive summarization system
p12
aVWe use the extracted key-phrases as queries to generate query-based abstracts
p13
aVWe estimate the percentage of the retrieved utterances based on the development set
