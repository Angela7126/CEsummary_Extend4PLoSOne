VIn contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues
p1
aVSpecifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions
p2
aVHowever, in the Riedel u'\u005cu2019' s dataset, Mintz++, the MaxEnt relation extractor, does not perform well, and our framework cannot improve its performance
p3
aVIn order to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, we derive two kinds of clues from an existing KB, which are further utilized to discover the disagreements among local candidate predictions
p4
aVWe propose to perform joint inference upon multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit clues that are encoded with relation specific requirements and can be learnt from existing knowledge bases
p5
aVWe also find an interesting results in the DBpedia dataset, ILP is more
