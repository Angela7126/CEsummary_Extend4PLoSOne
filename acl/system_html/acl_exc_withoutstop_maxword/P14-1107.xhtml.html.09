<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We form two graphs the first graph ( G T ) represents Turkers (translator/editor pairs) as nodes; the second graph ( G C ) represents candidate translated and post-edited sentences (henceforth u'\u201c' candidates u'\u201d' ) as nodes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As discussed, we model the collection of candidates as a weighted undirected graph, G C , in which nodes in the graph represent candidate sentences and edges represent lexical relatedness</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The problem definition of the crowdsourcing translation task is straightforward given a set of candidate translations for a source sentence, we want to choose the best output translation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The second method selects the translation generated by the Turker who, on average, provides translations with the minimum average TER</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The adjacency matrix [ M ] denotes the transition probabilities</a>
