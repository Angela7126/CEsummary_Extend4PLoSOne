VWe form two graphs the first graph ( G T ) represents Turkers (translator/editor pairs) as nodes; the second graph ( G C ) represents candidate translated and post-edited sentences (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' candidates u'\u005cu201d' ) as nodes
p1
aVAs discussed, we model the collection of candidates as a weighted undirected graph, G C , in which nodes in the graph represent candidate sentences and edges represent lexical relatedness
p2
aVThe problem definition of the crowdsourcing translation task is straightforward given a set of candidate translations for a source sentence, we want to choose the best output translation
p3
aVThis output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages
p4
aV× 1 to denote the saliency scores u'\u005cu03a0' of candidates and Turker pairs
p5
aVThe second method selects the translation generated by the Turker who, on average, provides translations with the minimum average TER
p6
aVThe adjacency matrix [ M ] denotes the transition probabilities
