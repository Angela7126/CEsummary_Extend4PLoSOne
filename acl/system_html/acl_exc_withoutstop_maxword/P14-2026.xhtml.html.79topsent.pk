VTherefore, we applied a rule plmod lobj (localizer object) to reposition the dependent word of the plmod relation (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' å‰ u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 2) to the position before the lobj structure (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' ç¾å›½ å¤§ä½¿é¦† u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 2

aVWe define the dependency structure of a dependency relation as the structure containing the dependent word (e.g.,, the word directly indicated by plmod, or u'\u005cu201c' å‰ u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 2) and the whole subtree under the dependency relation (all of the words that directly or indirectly depend on the dependent word, or the words under u'\u005cu201c' å‰ u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 2
