<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the Twitter data 3 3 http://github.com/aritter/twitter-nlp [ 13 ] to directly extract named entities from tweets</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Firstly, a named entity recognizer [ 13 ] is employed to identify named entities</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, a traditional NER tool such as the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 2 2 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml is used to identify named entities from the news articles crawled from BBC and CNN during the same period that the tweets were published</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this section, we first describe the Twitter corpus used in our experiments and then present how we build a baseline based on the previously proposed TwiCal system [ 14 ] , the state-of-the-art open event extraction system on tweets</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well</a>
