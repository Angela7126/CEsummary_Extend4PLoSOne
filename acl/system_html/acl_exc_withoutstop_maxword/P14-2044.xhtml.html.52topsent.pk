VThough coarse-grained tags have their place [ 17 ] , in many cases the distributional and morphological distinctions between words are more closely aligned with the fine-grained tagsets, which typically distinguish between verb tenses, noun number and gender, and adjectival scale (comparative, superlative, etc.), so we feel that the evaluation against fine-grained tagset is more relevant here

aVIn this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model based on the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP; Blei and Frazier, 2011

aVMoreover, the mapping between a surface form and morphology is complex and nonlinear, so that simple metrics such as edit distance will only weakly approximate morphological similarity
