aVWe conducted an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) evaluation where AMT workers compared the output of Summa to that of timelines and flat summaries
p4
aVThus, descriptions from both Summa and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information
p5
aVUsing the same setup as in the previous experiment, for each topic, five AMT workers spent three minutes reading through a timeline or summary and were then asked to write a description of what they had learned
p6
aVSince Summa was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1 , it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those from Summa
p7
aVDescriptions written by workers using Summa were preferred over twice as often as those from timelines
