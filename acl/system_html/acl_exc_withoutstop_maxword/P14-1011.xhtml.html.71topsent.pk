VAssuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings
p1
aVInstead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT
p2
aVAccordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning
p3
aVTherefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase
p4
aVWith the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate
p5
aVIn our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs
p6
aVAs the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN
