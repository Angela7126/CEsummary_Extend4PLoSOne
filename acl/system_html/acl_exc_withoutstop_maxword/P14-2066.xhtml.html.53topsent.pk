VAs strength is inherently relative, it is natural to look at revisions that change statement strength, which we refer to as u'\u005cu201c' strength changes u'\u005cu201d'
p1
aVFor instance, the majority labeled pair 2 as u'\u005cu201c' stronger u'\u005cu201d'
p2
aVMany differences between these versions constitute a source of valid and motivated strength differences, as can be seen from the sentential revisions in Table 1
p3
aVBut it is clear that the majority of changes are rewrites; thus revisions on the arXiv indeed provide a great source for potential strength differences
p4
aVFor pair 1, while one turker pointed out the decline in number of experiments, most turkers simply labeled it as stronger because it was more specific u'\u005cu201c' Specific u'\u005cu201d' turned out to be a common reason used in the comments, even though we said
