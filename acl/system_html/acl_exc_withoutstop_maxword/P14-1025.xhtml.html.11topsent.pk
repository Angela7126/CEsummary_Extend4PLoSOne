VSuch an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions u'\u005cu2014' and predominant senses too u'\u005cu2014' vary from corpus to corpus
p1
aVWe further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u005cu2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus
p2
aVThey then predict the most likely sense for each word in the document based on the topic distribution and the words in context ( u'\u005cu201c' corroborators u'\u005cu201d' ), each of which, in turn, depends on the document u'\u005cu2019' s topic distribution
p3
aVBecause of domain differences and the skewed nature of word sense distributions, it is often the case that some senses in a sense inventory will not be attested in a given corpus

aVThe word senses are ranked
