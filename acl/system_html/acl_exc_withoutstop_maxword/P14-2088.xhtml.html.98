<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Moon and Baldridge ( 2007 ) tackle the challenging problem of tagging Middle English, using techniques for projecting syntactic annotations across languages</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is also possible to apply stacking, by passing this vector through another autoencoder [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While a number of different approaches for domain adaptation have been proposed [ 21 , 26 ] , they tend to emphasize bag-of-words features for classification tasks such as sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Consequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks</a>
