VOn the u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d' dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1
p1
aVNext, three spelling correction methods were tested noisy channel, iterative correction and our method (stochastic iterative correction
p2
aVNoisy channel and iterative methods u'\u005cu2019' frontiers are considerably inferior to the proposed method on u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d' dataset, which means that our method works better
p3
aVGiven P ( q 0 q 1 ) defined, to correct the word q 1 we could iterate through all ever-observed words, and choose the one, that maximizes the posterior probability
p4
aVAs any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word
p5
aVPosterior is defined by Equation 6 for the baseline and simple iterative methods and by Equations 3 and 6 for
