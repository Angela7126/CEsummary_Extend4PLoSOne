aVLarger corpora also offer stronger signals that might enable our Monte Carlo methods to mix faster and detect regularities more accurately
p2
aVName similarity is also an important component of within -document coreference resolution, and efforts in that area bear resemblance to our approach describe an u'\u005cu201c' entity-centered u'\u005cu201d' model where a distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process is used to pick previous coreferent mentions within a document

aVThus, our sampled phylogenies tend to make similar names coreferent u'\u005cu2014' especially long or unusual names that would be expensive to generate repeatedly, and especially in contexts
