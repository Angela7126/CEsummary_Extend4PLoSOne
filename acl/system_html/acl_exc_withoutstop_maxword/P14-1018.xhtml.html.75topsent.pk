aVHowever, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10
p2
aVFor each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles
p3
aVSharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u005cu2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest
p4
aVFinally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types

aVBaseline User Model As input we are given a set of vertices representing users of interest v i u'\u005cu2208' V along with feature vectors f u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2062' ( v i ) derived from content authored by the user of interest

aVWe show that three of six social circles u'\u005cu2013' friend, retweet and user-mention yield better accuracy compared to the user model for all graphs when t u'\u005cu2265' 250

aV[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features
p8
aVThe proposed baseline model follows the same trends as the existing state-of-the-art approaches for user attribute classification in social media as described in Section 8
p9
aVOur goal is to classify users of interest using evidence (e.g.,, communications) from their local neighborhood u'\u005cu2211' n f u'\u005cu2192' t u'\u005cu2062' [ N r u'\u005cu2062' ( v i ) ] u'\u005cu2261' f u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2062' ( N r ) as Democratic or Republican
