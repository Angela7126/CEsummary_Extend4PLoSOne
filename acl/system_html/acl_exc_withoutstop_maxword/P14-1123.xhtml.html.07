<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, including our proposed measure of syntactic complexity in an automatic scoring model results in a statistically significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Guided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion</a>
