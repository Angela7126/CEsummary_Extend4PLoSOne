<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be generated</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Except in Row 8 and Row 11, when two head nouns of entity pair were combined as semantic pair and when POS tag were combined with the entity type, the performances are decreased</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Both head noun and POS tag are position sensitive</a>
