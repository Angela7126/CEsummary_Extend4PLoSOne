<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u2018' pure u'\u2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives</a>
