<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper investigates a variety of ways in which word embeddings might augment a constituency parser with a discrete state space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While word embeddings can be constructed directly from surface distributional statistics, as in LSA, more sophisticated tools for unsupervised extraction of word representations have recently gained popularity [ 3 , 10 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Dependency parsers have seen gains from distributional statistics in the form of discrete word clusters [ 9 ] , and recent work [ 2 ] suggests that similar gains can be derived from embeddings like the ones used in this paper</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For OOV words which are not in the dictionary of embeddings, we back off to the unknown word model for the underlying parser</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Word embeddings u'\u2014' representations of lexical items as points in a real vector space u'\u2014' have a long history in natural language processing, going back at least as far as work on latent semantic analysis (LSA) for information retrieval [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It seems clear that word embeddings exhibit some syntactic structure</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Semi-supervised and unsupervised models for a variety of core NLP tasks, including named-entity recognition [ 5 ] , part-of-speech tagging [ 13 ] , and chunking [ 15 ] have been shown to benefit from the</a>
