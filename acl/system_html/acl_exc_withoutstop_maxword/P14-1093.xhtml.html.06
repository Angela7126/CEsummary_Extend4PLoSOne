<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We then estimated that, with the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality candidates, among which the estimated number of positive examples is 377,794</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To favor the baselines for fairness, the event causality candidates of the development and test data were restricted to those with excitation values</a>
