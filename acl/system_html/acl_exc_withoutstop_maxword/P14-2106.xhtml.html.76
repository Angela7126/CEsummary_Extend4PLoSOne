<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Broadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora []</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Broadly speaking, we can classify the attempts to add external knowledge to a parser in two sets using large semantic repositories such as WordNet and approaches that use information automatically acquired from corpora</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the combination of the three baseline parsers did not give any improvement over the best single parser (ZPar), we can hypothesize that the gain coming from the parser combinations comes mostly from the addition of semantic information</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We firstly tested the addition of each individual semantic feature to each parser, evaluating its contribution to the parser u'\u2019' s performance</a>
