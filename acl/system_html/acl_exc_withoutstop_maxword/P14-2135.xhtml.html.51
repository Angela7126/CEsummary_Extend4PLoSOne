<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Turney et al algorithm quantifies the concreteness of concepts that lack such a rating based on their proximity to rated concepts in a semantic vector space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By applying a logistic regression with noun concreteness as the predictor variable, Turney et al achieved a classification accuracy of 79% on this task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u222a' C introduced in Section 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, we explored whether image dispersion can be applied to specific NLP tasks as an effective proxy for concreteness</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The USF evaluation set is particularly appropriate in the present context because concepts in the dataset are also rated for conceptual concreteness by at least 10 human annotators</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Multi-modal models in which perceptual input is filtered according to our algorithm learn higher-quality semantic representations than previous approaches, resulting in a significant performance improvement of up to 17% in capturing the semantic similarity of concepts</a>
