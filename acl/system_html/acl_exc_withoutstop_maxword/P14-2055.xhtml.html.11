<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we present a Bayesian model for assessing the novelty of a sentence taken from a summarization input with respect to a background corpus of documents</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These systems combine (i) a score based on the background ( KL back , TS or SR ) with (ii) the score based on the input only ( KL inp</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
