VAs indicated in the above section, we restrict the set of undirected trees to be those such that after applying h dir the resulting t is projective i.e., there are no crossing brackets
p1
aVGenerating a bracketing via an undirected tree enables us to build on existing methods for structure learning of latent-tree graphical models [ Choi et al.2011 , Anandkumar et al.2011 ]
p2
aVThis undirected tree is converted into a directed tree by applying h dir
p3
aVIn particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies [ Choi et al.2011 , Song et al.2011 ,
