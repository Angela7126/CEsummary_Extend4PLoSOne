<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So to sum up on the u'\u201c' labeled evaluation u'\u201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>IRREG-BY-PARSER the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The evaluation on u'\u201c' structured representation u'\u201d' can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only both LAS and UAS are measured independently of errors on regular MWE status (note the UAS is exactly the same than in the u'\u201c' labeled u'\u201d'</a>
