<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose to perform joint inference upon multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit clues that are encoded with relation specific requirements and can be learnt from existing knowledge bases</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The previous categories of disagreements are all based on the implicit type information of the relations u'\u2019' arguments, Now we make use of the clues of argument cardinality requirements</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, Country and birthPlace take up about 30% in the local predictions, we thus add clues that are related to these two relations, and then move on with new clues related to other relations according to those relations u'\u2019' proportions in the local predictions</a>
