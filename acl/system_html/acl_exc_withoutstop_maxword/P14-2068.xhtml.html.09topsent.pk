VWe are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings
p1
aVHaving obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings
p2
aVThis prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality
p3
aVGiven the importance of cue words as a signal for factuality, we want to assess the factuality judgments induced by each cue
p4
aVSeveral of the cues with the lowest factuality coefficients are predicates of belief suggest , predict and think
p5
aVThe cues according , report , say , and tell are strongly predictive of certainty, but the cues claim and deny convey uncertainty
p6
aVThe cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge
p7
aVWe rely on FactBank to assign the cue words to classes; the only word not covered by FactBank was sense , which we placed in predicates of perception
p8
aVHowever, this prior work has not explored the linguistic basis of factuality
