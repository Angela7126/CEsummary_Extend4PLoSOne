VOur method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames
p1
aVThen, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs
p2
aVWe induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al
p3
aVinduce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1
p4
aVWe first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al
p5
aVWe evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al
p6
aVTo output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb

aV2006 ) ) model to jointly learn argument structures (subcategorization frames) and verb classes by using syntactic features
p8
aVBased on the best results in the above evaluations, we induced semantic frames using slot-word pair features, and then induced verb classes using slot-only features
p9
aVIn this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes that is aware of verb polysemy
p10
aVTo do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses
p11
aVWe can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb
p12
aVIn this paper, we propose a two-step approach for inducing semantic frames and verb classes
p13
aVapply clustering to the initial frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ] to produce verb-specific semantic frames
p14
aVFirst, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point [ 14 , 23 ]
p15
aV2008 ) also applied probabilistic soft clustering to verbs by incorporating subcategorization frames and selectional preferences based on WordNet
p16
aV2012 ) extended the model of Titov and Klementiev ( 2012 ) , which is an unsupervised model for inducing semantic roles, to jointly induce semantic roles and frames across verbs using the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ]
p17
aV2003 ) evaluated hard clusterings based on a gold standard with multiple classes per verb
p18
aV2009 ) proposed a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM; Neal ( 2000 ) ) to cluster verbs based on subcategorization frame distributions
p19
aVBy taking this step-wise approach, we can not only induce verb classes with frequency information from a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy
p20
aVAfter performing soft clustering, they noted that most verbs fell into a single class, and they decided to assign a single class to each verb by hardening the clustering
p21
aVIn particular, they tried to consider verb polysemy by using the IB method, which is a soft clustering method [ 43 ]
p22
aV2003 ) , prepositional phrases (pp) are parameterized for two frequent subcategorization frames (NP and NP_PP), and the unfiltered raw frequencies of subcategorization frames are used as features to represent a verb
p23
aVSince we focus on the handling of verb polysemy, predominant class induction for each verb is not our main objective
p24
aVinduce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering predicate-argument structures for each verb extracted from automatic parses as shown in the lower part of Figure 1 , and
p25
aVLapata and Brew ( 2004 ) and Li and Brew ( 2007 ) proposed probabilistic models for calculating prior probabilities of verb classes for a verb
p26
aVAlthough Bayesian approaches are a possible solution to simultaneously induce frames and verb classes from a corpus as used in previous studies, it has prohibitive computational cost
p27
aVWe regard each output cluster as a semantic frame, by merging the initial frames in a cluster into a semantic frame
p28
aVWe regard each output cluster as a verb class this time
p29
aV9 9 Since FrameNet frames are not assigned to all verbs of SemLink, the number of verbs is different from the evaluations against VerbNet classes
p30
aVThis result is consistent with expectations, given a gold standard based on Levin u'\u005cu2019' s verb classes, which are organized according to the syntactic behavior of verbs
p31
aVThe clusterings with the NN and IB methods are obtained by using the VALEX subcategorization lexicon
p32
aVVerb classes are one such lexical resource
p33
aVFrom the result, we can see that the induced verb classes based on slot-only features did not achieve a higher F 1 than those based on slot-word pair features in many cases
p34
aVParisien and Stevenson ( 2011 ) extended their model by adding semantic features
p35
aVHowever, since these measures are only applicable to a hard clustering, it is necessary to extend them to be applicable to a soft clustering, because in our task a verb can belong to multiple clusters or classes
p36
aVInterestingly, this result indicates that slot distributions are more effective than lexical information in slot-word pairs for inducing verb classes similar to the gold standard
p37
aVThe original method in Kawahara et al
p38
aVWhen we evaluate against the multiple classes in the gold standard, we do normalize the inverse purity
p39
aVAs we did with the multi-class evaluations, we adopt modified purity (mPU), inverse purity (iPU) and their harmonic mean (F 1 ) as the metrics for the evaluation with predominant classes
p40
aVThese models are approximated to condition not on verbs but on subcategorization frames
p41
aVHowever, the verb itself is still represented as a single data point
p42
aVHe used a model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al
p43
aVAs our baselines, we adopt two previously proposed methods
p44
aV2003 ) (Table 1 of their paper) which was created by considering verb polysemy on the basis of Levin u'\u005cu2019' s classes and the LCS database [ 6 ]
p45
aVWe can see that u'\u005cu201c' web/SW-S u'\u005cu201d' achieved the best performance and obtained a higher F 1 than the baselines by more than nine points u'\u005cu201c' Web/SW-S u'\u005cu201d' uses the combination of slot-word pair features for clustering verb-specific frames and slot-only features for clustering across verbs
p46
aVNote that our results of the NN and IB methods are different from those reported in their paper since the data source is different
p47
aVWe speculate that slot distributions are not so different among verbs when all uses of a verb are merged into one frame, and thus their discrimination power is lower than that in the intermediate construction of semantic frames
p48
aVSince they focused on the incorporation of selectional preferences, they did not evaluate verb classes but evaluated only selectional preferences using a language model-based measure
p49
aV2003 ) , using the gold standard with multiple classes, which we also use for our multi-class evaluations
p50
aVFor instance, u'\u005cu201c' Class 2 u'\u005cu201d' consists of the semantic frames u'\u005cu201c' need:2 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' say:2 u'\u005cu201d' These frames were merged due to the high syntactic similarity of constituting slot distributions, which are comprised of a subject and a sentential complement
p51
aVHe applied this method to the BNC and acquired 1,200 frames and 400 roles [ 21 ]
p52
aVThis is because an initial frame has the same structure as a semantic frame, which is produced by merging initial frames
p53
aVIn addition, to penalize clusters that consist of only one verb, such singleton clusters in K are considered as errors, as is usual with modified purity
p54
aVIt is not necessary to normalize these metrics when we treat verbs as monosemous, and evaluate against the predominant sense
p55
aVThe results of the IB baseline and our methods are obtained by averaging five runs
p56
aVThese two levels of evaluations are performed by considering the work of Reichart et al
p57
aVIt is necessary to specify the number of clusters, k , for the IB method beforehand, and we adopt 35 and 42 clusters according to their reported high accuracies
p58
aVAs usual, the following normalized inverse purity (niPU) is used to measure the recall of a clustering
p59
aVmerge the predicate-argument structures that have presumably the same meaning based on the assumption of one sense per collocation [ 46 ] to get a set of initial frames, and
p60
aVBoth of these are represented as a probabilistic distribution of words across verbs
p61
aVThe other representation using the slot-word pairs means that semantic similarity based on word overlap is naturally considered by looking at lexical information
p62
aVAs mentioned in Li and Brew ( 2007 ) , it is desirable to extend the model to depend on verbs to further improve accuracy
p63
aVThis monosemous assumption, however, is not realistic because many frequent verbs actually have multiple senses
p64
aVThe results of these methods are obtained by averaging five runs
p65
aVIt is not necessary to normalize these metrics because the clustering of these instances is hard
p66
aVCapturing the sense of a verb is essential for natural language processing (NLP), and thus lexical resources for verbs play an important role in NLP
p67
aVTo prepare a web corpus, we extracted sentences from crawled web pages that are judged to be written in English based on the encoding information
p68
aVFinally, we use the harmonic mean (F 1 ) of nmPU and niPU as a single measure of clustering quality
p69
aVThis model is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Minimum Description Length principle
p70
aVFor the features, w , in equation ( 2 ), we try the two representations again slot-only features and slot-word pair features
p71
aVAn excerpt from this data is shown in Table 1
p72
aVThe normalized modified purity (nmPU) can then be written as follows
p73
aVWe select an argument in the following order by considering the degree of effect on the verb sense
