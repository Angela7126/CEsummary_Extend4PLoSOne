VJoint Parsing and POS Correction Table 3 shows the results of joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset, for our model and state-of-the-art systems
p1
aVDependency parsing is commonly cast as a maximization problem over a parameterized scoring function
p2
aVBecause the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees
p3
aVIn this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt the method for parsing with rich scoring functions
p4
aVThe reranker uses the same features as our model, along with the tree scores obtained from the MST parser (which is a standard practice in reranking
p5
aVMuch of the recent work on parsing has been focused on improving methods for solving the combinatorial maximization inference problems
p6
aVHowever, for the joint parsing and POS
