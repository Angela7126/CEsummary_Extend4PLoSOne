VTwo terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure
p1
aVMore concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis
p2
aVGiven a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure
p3
aVThis task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic role appears elsewhere and can be inferred from discourse
p4
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p5
aVTwo terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument , aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well
p6
aVThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p7
aVOn the other hand, in some cases the candidate argument is not a DNI, but is still required in textual inference
p8
aVThe SemEval task, termed henceforth as Implied SRL , involves three major sub-tasks
p9
aVThe most notable work targeting implied predicate-argument relationships is the 2010 SemEval task of Linking Events and Their Participants in Discourse [ 15 ]
