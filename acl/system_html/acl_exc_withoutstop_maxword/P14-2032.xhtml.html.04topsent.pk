VIn the following example, both baseline models miss the contextually clear use of the word 点心 ( u'\u005cu201c' sweets / snack food u'\u005cu201d' ) and instead attach 点 to the prior word to produce the otherwise common compound 一点点 ( u'\u005cu201c' a little bit u'\u005cu201d' ); dual decomposition allows the model to generate the correct segmentation
p1
aVA powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time

aV\u005cnewcite Sun:2010:COLING details their respective theoretical strengths character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new oov words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can
