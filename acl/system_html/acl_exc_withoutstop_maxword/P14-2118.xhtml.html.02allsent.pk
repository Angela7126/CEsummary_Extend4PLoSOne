VUsing an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification
p1
aVComputational applications of subjectivity, including sentiment analysis and information extraction, have focused largely on phrase or document meaning
p2
aVIn addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p3
aVIntuitively, adjectives ascribing physical properties ( wooden shed ) are more objective than those conveying abstract traits ( suspicious man
p4
aVSubjectivity analysis has already proved highly applicable to a range of NLP applications, including sentiment analysis, information extraction and text categorization [ 22 , 24 ]
p5
aVBolinger ( 1967 ) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions ( the cake is sweet ), rather than attributive constructions ( the German capital ) more frequently than objective adjectives
p6
aVIn the non-literal expressions kill the process or black comedy , a verb or adjective that occurs with a concrete argument in literal phrases takes an abstract argument
p7
aVTogether with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks
p8
aVConcreteness , the degree to which language has a perceptible physical referent, and subjectivity , the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker, are well established cognitive and linguistic notions
p9
aVIn this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs [ 27 ] , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs [ 5 ]
p10
aVA large and growing body of empirical evidence indicates clear differences between concrete concepts, such as donut or hotdog and abstract concepts, such as guilt or obesity
p11
aVIn a similar vein, interest in subjectivity analysis is set to grow with interest in extracting sentiment and opinion from the web and social media [ 3 ]
p12
aVNotably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition
p13
aVTo verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al
p14
aVTo create a distinct but analogous binary categorization problem to the composition task, we filtered out pairs not unanimously allocated to either class
p15
aVWe evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks
p16
aVThe results of our analyses also demonstrate a clear interaction between subjectivity and concreteness scores for nouns attributed by human raters
p17
aVAdamson ( 2000 ) proposes that more subjective adjectives typically occur furthest from the noun in multiple-modifier strings such as ( hot crossed buns
p18
aVHowever, recent work has highlighted the application of subjectivity analysis to lexical semantics, for instance to the tasks of disambiguating words according to their usage or sense [ 28 , 2 ]
p19
aVTo explore the relationship between concreteness, subjectivity and meaning, we plotted the 20,000 highest frequency ( a , n ) pairs in the BNC in the CONC-SUBJ semantic space (Figure 2, top
p20
aVModels were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined
p21
aVConcrete words are more easily learned, remembered and processed than abstract words [ 21 ] , while differences in brain activity [ 4 ] and cognitive representation [ 13 ] have also been observed
p22
aVIndeed, in certain cases the original, apparently objective, senses of polysemous adjectives are not modifiable ( very wooden shed ?), while their more abstract sense extensions are ( very wooden personality
p23
aVWe describe an unsupervised corpus-based method to quantify adjective subjectivity, and show that it effectively predicts the labels of a hand-coded subjectivity lexicon
p24
aVThe performance of each model is presented in Table 3, along with a baseline score reflecting the strategy of allocating all pairs to the largest class
p25
aVRecent results suggest that they could also be useful knowledge for natural language processing systems that aim to extract and represent the meaning of language
p26
aVUnlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ]
p27
aVWe instead extract scores from a recently released dataset of lexical concepts rated on a 1-5 scale for concreteness by 20 annotators in a crowdsourcing experiment [ 9 ]
p28
aV2013 ) crowdsourced data whereas Turney et al infer concreteness scores from a smaller training set
p29
aVQualitative investigations further suggest the interaction between these dimensions to be useful in the semantic characterization of adjective-noun pairs, a proposition we test formally in the next section
p30
aVAdditive improvement over the baseline in each case was lower than for the composition task, which may reflect the greater subtlety inherent in the subsective/intersective classification
p31
aVDemonstrable commonalities in how different people perceive the physical world suggest that concrete language may be more objective than abstract language [ 16 ]
p32
aVPairs in the bottom-left region of the CONC-SUBJ space (objective adjectives with abstract nouns, such as green politics ) seem to exhibit a non-literal, or at least non prototypical modification type
p33
aVIn contrast, for pairs in the objective+concrete corner, the adjectives appear to perform a classifying or categorizing function ( baptist minister
p34
aVFor the 24,908 adjectives that occur in some adjective-noun pair with one of these nouns in the British National Corpus (BNC) [ 18 ] , we extracted subjectivity features from the Google Books Corpus [ 11 ]
p35
aVWe thus define adverbiability as the frequency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g
p36
aVSuch models, which learn representations from both linguistic and perceptual input, outperform text-only models on a range of evaluations
p37
aVThe authors are supported by St John u'\u005cu2019' s College, Cambridge and The Royal Society
p38
aVWe thus define comparability as the frequency of comparative or superlative forms relative to the frequency of the base form, e.g
p39
aVMoreover, given that humans seem to exploit both concreteness [ 20 ] and subjectivity [ 10 ] clues when processing language, it is likely that the same clues should benefit computational models aiming to replicate human-level performance in this area
p40
aVHowever, while multi-modal models acquire richer representations of concrete concepts, their ability to represent abstract concepts can be weaker than text-only models [ 13 ]
p41
aVIn this section we have outlined a set of corpus features that, taken together, enable effective approximation of adjective subjectivity
p42
aVThe performance of individual features as predictors in isolation is shown in Figure 1 (top
p43
aV1985 ) theorizes that subjective adjectives tend to develop derived adverbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives do not
p44
aVFurther, we show for the first time that adjective subjectivity correlates with noun concreteness in large corpora
p45
aV2011 ) present a supervised model that exploits this effect to correctly classify 79% of adjective-noun pairs as having literal or non-literal meaning
p46
aVAnother characteristic of gradable adjectives noted by Wiebe ( 2000 ) is that they admit degree modifiers ( very/quite delicious
p47
aVFollowing Wiebe, we note that the existence of comparative forms for an adjective are indicative of gradability
p48
aVWhile automatic methods have been proposed for the quantification of lexical concreteness, they each rely on dictionaries or similar hand-coded resources [ 15 , 27 ]
p49
aVA principled treatment of concreteness is thus likely to be important if the multi-modal approach is to prove effective on a wider range of concepts
p50
aVBecause a red car is both a car and red, the pair is classed as intersective , whereas dark humour , which is not literally dark, is classed as subsective
p51
aVWe therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u005cu2018' pure u'\u005cu2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives
p52
aVIn linguistic conctructions, concreteness appears to influence compound and phrasal semantics [ 26 , 7 , 27 ]
p53
aVThe remainder are motivated by corpus studies and/or observations from the theoretical literature
p54
aVThe concreteness model performance represents further confirmation of the link between concreteness and composition
p55
aV2012 ) introduce a set of 370 adjective-noun pairs grouped into modification types by human judges
p56
aVWe again aim to classify the remaining 211 intersective and 93 subsective pairs with a logistic regression
p57
aV2011 ) developed a list of 100 common adjective-noun pairs classified as either denotative (used literally) or connotative (non-literal) by five annotators
p58
aVFor example, the utterance he sits across the table is more subjective than he sits opposite Sam as its truth depends on the speaker u'\u005cu2019' s position
p59
aVIndeed, inter-annotator agreement for this goldstandard (Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu039a' = 0.87 ) was lower than for the composition task (0.95), implying a less cognitively salient distinction
p60
aVIn addition, to examine the effect of concreteness alone on adjective-noun semantics, we defined a new adjective feature
p61
aVThe features Comparability and Modifiability are identified as predictors of subjectivity by Wiebe ( 2000
p62
aVIn contrast, here we present six corpus-based features designed to quantify the lexical subjectivity of adjectives
p63
aV2) Subjectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine
p64
aVWe therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence with one of a hand-coded list of English degree modifiers
p65
aVWe first tested the relationship between concreteness and subjectivity with a correlation analysis over noun concepts
p66
aVWe conclude by discussing other potential applications of concreteness and subjectivity to NLP
p67
aVTo evaluate their model of lexical concreteness, Turney et al
p68
aVIn both spaces, the extremities reflect particular meaning combination types
p69
aVWe consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the frequency of occurrence as the leftmost of two adjectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings
p70
aVSpecifically, objective adjectives are more likely to modify concrete nouns and subjective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract nouns
p71
aVThe importance of concreteness to NLP systems is likely to grow with the emergence of multi-modal semantic models [ 8 , 25 ]
p72
aVOn the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al
p73
aVFor such applications, subjectivity is analyzed at the phrasal or document level
p74
aV1) Subjective / objective adjectives are more likely to modify abstract / concrete nouns respectively
p75
aVMany adjectives also function as nouns ( sweet cake vs boiled sweet
p76
aVSubjectivity is the degree to which language is interpretable independently of the speaker u'\u005cu2019' s perspective [ 17 ]
p77
aV2011 ) is perhaps to be expected, since our model exploits the wide scope of the new Brysbaert et al
p78
aVWe therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions
p79
aVMotivated by these observations, in the following sections we test two hypotheses
p80
aVFor each noun n we defined its subjectivity profile as the mean of the subjectivity vectors of its modifying adjectives
p81
aVThis effect is illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom
p82
aVIn the CONC-ExpCONC space, on the diagonal, where noun-concreteness is u'\u005cu2018' as expected u'\u005cu2019' , pairings appear to combine literally
p83
aVFigure 2 (bottom) illustrates the the CONC-ExpCONC space
p84
aVIn the top-left, where ExpCONC is greater than CONC , the combinations are almost all non-literal, as shown in Table 2
p85
aVInsight into concreteness can help systems to classify adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p86
aVAlthough all models improve on the majority-class baseline, the combined model was again most effective
p87
aVIn addressing (1), we extracted the 2,000 highest-frequency nouns from the Brysbaert et al
p88
aVThe modification-type task has no performance benchmark since Boleda et al
p89
aVThe improvement of this model over Turney et al
p90
aVLanguage may also be subjective because it conveys evaluations or opinions [ 19 ]
p91
aV3 3 Several of the features here were applied by Hill ( 2012 ) , to the task of ordering multiple-modifier strings
p92
aVAway from the diagonal, meaning composition is less predictable
p93
aVWiebe ( 2000 ) oberve that gradable are more likely to be subjective
p94
aVSince each of the six features takes values on [ 0 , 1 ] , we define the overall subjectivity of an adjective a with feature vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2c' a = [ s 1 a u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2026' u'\u005cu2062' s 6 a ] as
