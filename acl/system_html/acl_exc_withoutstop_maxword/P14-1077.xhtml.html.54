<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two categories of clues that implicitly capture relations u'\u2019' backgrounds their expected argument types and argument cardinalities, based on which we can discover two categories of disagreements among the candidate predictions, summarized as argument type inconsistencies and violations of arguments u'\u2019' uniqueness, which have been rarely considered before</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On the other hand, most previous relation extractors process each entity pair (we will use entity pair and entity tuple exchangeably in the rest of the paper) locally and individually, i.e.,, the extractor makes decisions solely based on the sentences containing the current entity pair and</a>
