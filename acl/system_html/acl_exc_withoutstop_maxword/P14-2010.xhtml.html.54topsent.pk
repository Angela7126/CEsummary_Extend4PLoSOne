VIf a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1
p1
aV[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents
p2
aVIn this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words
p3
aVIf a document d belongs to the class c1 then a set of artificial words which represent the class c1 are appended into the document d, otherwise a set of artificial words which represent the class c2 are appended
p4
aVIf the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels
p5
aVIf the annotator assigns a wrong class label to a topic representing multiple classes (e.g., first topic in
