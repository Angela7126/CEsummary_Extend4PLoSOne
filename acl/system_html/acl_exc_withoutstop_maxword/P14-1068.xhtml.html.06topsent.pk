VTable 3 shows examples of word pairs with highest semantic and visual similarity according to the SAE model
p1
aVThe automatically obtained textual and visual attribute vectors serve as input to SVD, kCCA, and our stacked autoencoder (SAE
p2
aVVector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, respectively
p3
aVAnd the visual SAE correlates better with visual similarity judgments ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.60) compared to the textual SAE ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.52
p4
aVInterestingly, the bimodal SAE is better than the unimodal variants on both types of similarity judgments, semantic and visual
p5
aVAs baselines, we also report the performance of a model based solely on textual attributes (which we obtain from Strudel), visual attributes (obtained from our classifiers), and their concatenation (see row Attributes in Table 2 , and columns T, V, and T+V, respectively
p6
aVThe vector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, examples of which are shown in Figure 2
p7
aVWe give details on the tasks and datasets used for evaluation, we explain how the textual and visual inputs were constructed, how
