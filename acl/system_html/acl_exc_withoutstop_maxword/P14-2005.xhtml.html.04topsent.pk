VTo account for missing or spurious links, we observe that x u'\u005cu2219' C k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' N k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key non-coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' C r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response coreference links missing in the key; x u'\u005cu2219' N r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response non-coreference links missing in the key, and we propose to extend the coreference F-measure and non-coreference F-measure as follows
