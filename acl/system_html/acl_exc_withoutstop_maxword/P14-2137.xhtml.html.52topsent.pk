VTo address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1 ) [ 7 , 17 ]

aVIn clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations
