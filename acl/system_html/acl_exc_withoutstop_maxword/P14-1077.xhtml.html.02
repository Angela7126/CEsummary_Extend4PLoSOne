<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two categories of clues that implicitly capture relations u'\u2019' backgrounds their expected argument types and argument cardinalities, based on which we can discover two categories of disagreements among the candidate predictions, summarized as argument type inconsistencies and violations of arguments u'\u2019' uniqueness, which have been rarely considered before</a>
