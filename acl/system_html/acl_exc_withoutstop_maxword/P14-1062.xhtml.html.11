<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Concretely, we think of u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' as the input sentence and u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' i u'\u2208' u'\u211d' is a single feature value associated with the i -th word in the sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, the second layer is obtained by applying a convolution to the sentence matrix u'\ud835' u'\udc2c' itself</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Like in the convolutional networks for object recognition [] , we enrich the representation in the first layer by computing multiple feature maps with different filters applied to the input sentence</a>
