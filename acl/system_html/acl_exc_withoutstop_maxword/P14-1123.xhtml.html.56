<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with the human scores</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We consider a multiple regression automatic scoring model as studied in Zechner et al</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Accordingly, we will summarize the previously studied model, outline its limitations, show how our proposed measure addresses those limitations and compare the two measures for the task of automatic scoring of speech</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Based on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned</a>
