VThen a small amount of annotated data is used to build models to determine whether to accept a candidate expansion of an abbreviation based on these features
p1
aVOur abbreviation model is a pair character language model (LM), also known as a joint multi-gram model [] , whereby aligned symbols are treated as a single token and a smoothed n-gram model is estimated
p2
aVWe also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores
p3
aVIn this paper we concentrate on abbreviations, which we define as alphabetic NSWs that it would be normal to pronounce as
