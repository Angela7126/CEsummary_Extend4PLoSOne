<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To train our two CNN semantic models, we derived two parallel corpora based on the Paralex training data</a>
