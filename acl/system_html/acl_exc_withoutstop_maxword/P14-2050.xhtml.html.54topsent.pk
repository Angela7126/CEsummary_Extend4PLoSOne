aVA very common paradigm for acquiring such representations is based on the distributional hypothesis of Harris [ 16 ] , stating that words in similar contexts have similar meanings

aVIn the skip-gram model, each word w u'\u005cu2208' W is associated with a vector v w u'\u005cu2208' R d and similarly each context c u'\u005cu2208' C is represented as a vector v c u'\u005cu2208' R d , where W is the words vocabulary, C
