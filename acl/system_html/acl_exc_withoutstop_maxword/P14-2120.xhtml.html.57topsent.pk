VMore concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis
p1
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p2
aVThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p3
aVOn the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems
p4
aVSecond, each NI should be classified as Definite NI (DNI) , meaning that the role filler must exist in the discourse, or Indefinite NI otherwise
p5
aVThus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text
p6
aVFirst, some relatively complex steps of the implied SRL task are avoided in our setting, while on the other hand it covers more relevant cases
p7
aVAnother case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI
p8
aVThis section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset
p9
aVFor example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u005cu201c' derailment of train u'\u005cu201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u005cu201c' crash of train u'\u005cu201d'

aVThe high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component
