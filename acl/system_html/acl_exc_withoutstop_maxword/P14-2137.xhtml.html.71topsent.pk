VOut of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations
p1
aVUnfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N
p2
aVTherefore, we leverage relation temporality , which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality [ 8 , 6 , 16 ]
