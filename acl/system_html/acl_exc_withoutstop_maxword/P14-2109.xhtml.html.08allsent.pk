(lp0
VThe F-s score roughly corresponds to the evalb score
p1
aVTherefore our analysis results in an attachment score for every regex
p2
aVTable 2 lists the most frequent categories in the three datasets, with their percentage of the overall number of brackets (%gold), their score based just on the head identification (F-h), their score based on head identification and (left and right) span (F-s), and the attachment (att) and span-right (spanR) scores for those that match based on the head
p3
aV1) For each regex match, we score whether it matches based on the span as well
p4
aVWe call the match just for the head the u'\u005cu201c' F-h u'\u005cu201d' score and the match that also includes the span information the u'\u005cu201c' F-s u'\u005cu201d' score
p5
aV2) Since the derivation tree is really a dependency tree with more complex nodes [] , we can also score each regex for attachment
p6
aVAlso, the attachment score is not relevant for regexes that already express a recursive structure, such as NP-modr
p7
aVThe attachment score does not apply to the recursive categories, as mentioned above
p8
aVFor example, the mediocre performance of the parser on SQ-vp barely affects the score with OntoNotes, but has a larger negative effect with Answers, due to its increased frequency in the latter
p9
aVThe score is lower for Answers, as also found by
p10
aVThese show the cumulative score in order of the frequency of categories
p11
aVWe decompose both the gold and parser output trees into derivation trees with spinal etrees, and score based on the regexes projected by each word
p12
aV10 10 The final F-s value is lower than the evalb score - e.g., 92.5 for sections 2-21 (the rightmost point in the graph for sections 2-21 in the F-s graph in Figure 6 ) compared to the 93.8 evalb score
p13
aVWe show in Section 2.3 how this derivation tree representation is used to score this attachment error directly, rather than obscuring it as an NP bracket error as evalb would do
p14
aVHowever, the F-s score is for separate syntactic constructions (including also head identification), although we can also sum it over all the structures, as done later in Figure 6
p15
aV2) We wouldn u'\u005cu2019' t expect the test-on-training evalb score to be 100%, since it has to back off from the training data, but the results for the different categories vary widely, with e.g.,, the NP-modr F-h score much lower than other frequent regexes
p16
aVOne is that there are cases in which bracket spans match, but the head, as found by our regexes, is different in the gold and parser trees
p17
aVThe derivation trees provide elements of a dependency analysis, which allow us to calculate scores for head identification and attachment for different projections (e.g.,, PP
p18
aVPhrase-structure parsing is usually evaluated using evalb [] , which provides a score based on matching brackets
p19
aVThe simultaneous F-h and F-s scores let us identify constructions where the parser has the head projection correct, but gets the span wrong
p20
aV4) While the different distribution of constructions is a problem for Answers, more critical is the poor performance of the parser on determining the right edge of verbal constructions
p21
aVFor example, Figure 3 shows the derivation tree resulting from the decomposition of the tree in Figure 5
p22
aVThe tree in Figure 5 is the parser output corresponding to the gold tree in Figure 5 , and in this case gets the PP-t attachment wrong, while everything else is the same as the gold
p23
aVIt is this matching for span as well as head that allows us to compare our results to evalb
p24
aVCritical to this is the fact that the parser does well on determining the right edge of verbal structures, which affects the F-s score for VP-t (non-recursive), VP-aux, and S-vp
p25
aV1) The high performance on the OntoNotes WSJ material is in large part due to the score on the non-recursive regexes of NP-t, VP-t, S-vp, and the auxiliaries (points 1, 2, 4, 6 in the graphs
p26
aVThe two graphs in Figure 6 show the cumulative results based on F-h and F-s, respectively
p27
aVIn the results below in Table 2 and Figure 6 we combine the nonterminals that are not covered by one of the regexes with the simple non-recursive regex case for that nonterminal
p28
aVThe benefit of the approach described here is that now we can see the contribution to the evalb score of the particular types of constructions, and within those constructions, how well the parser is doing at getting the same head projection, but failing or not on the spans
p29
aV9 9 The score for the left edge is almost always very high for every category, and we just list here the right edge score
p30
aVThis is the case even if the score is broken down by brackets (NP, VP, etc.), because the brackets can represent different types of structures
p31
aVTogether these two aspects break down the evalb brackets into more meaningful categories, and the simultaneous head and span scoring allows us to separate these aspects in the analysis
p32
aV3) The different distribution of structures in Answers hurts performance
p33
aVSample regexes are shown in Figure 1
p34
aVIn Figure 3 , NP-t in etree #a5 is considered as having the attachment to #a3
p35
aV6 6 A regex intermediate in a etree, such as VP-t above, is considered to have a default null attachment
p36
aVIn this case, the NP on the left is identified as the head d) VP-crd is also a regex for a recursive structure, in this case for VP coordination, picking out the leftmost conjunct as the head of the structure
p37
aVWe ran the gold and parsed versions through our regex decomposition and derivation tree creation
p38
aVFor example, while u'\u005cu201c' to u'\u005cu201d' is a match for PP-t, its attachment is not, since in Figure 3 it is a child of the u'\u005cu201c' trip u'\u005cu201d' etree (#a5) and in Figure 3 it is a child of the u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' etree (#b3
p39
aVThe other cases is when brackets match, and may even have the same head, but their regex is different
p40
aVFor example, u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' is a match for VP-t in Figures 3 and 3 , and is also a match for the span as well, since in both derivation trees it includes the words u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu2026' Florida u'\u005cu201d'
p41
aVThe spanR score for VP-t is 95.8 for Sections 2-21 and 93.7 for Section 22
p42
aVPreliminary investigation shows that this is due in part to incorrect PP and SBAR placement (the PP-t and SBAR-s attachment scores (80.7 and 81.9) are worse for Answers compared to Section 22 (86.1 and 86.4)), and coordinated S-clauses with no conjunction
p43
aVThis is only 85.4 for VP-t in Answers, compared to the OntoNotes results mentioned in (1
p44
aVAfter describing in more detail the basic framework, we show some aspects of the resulting analysis of the performance of the Berkeley parser [] on three datasets a) OntoNotes WSJ sections 2-21 [] 1 1 We refer only to the WSJ treebank portion of OntoNotes, which is roughly a subset of the Penn Treebank [] with annotation revisions including the addition of NML nodes
p45
aVThis is reflected in the derivation tree in Figure 3 , in which the NP-modr regex is absent, with the NP-t and PP-t etrees #b5 and #b6 both pointing to the VP-t regex in #b3
p46
aVIn some cases, we need to search for particular nonterminal heads, such as with the (b) regexes S-vp and SQ-vp, which identify the rightmost VP among the children of a S or SQ as the head c) NP-modr is a regex for a recursive NP with a right modifier
p47
aVFor example, for sections 2-21, the score for NP-t is shown first, with 30.7% of the brackets, and then together with the VP-t category, they cover 45.2% of the brackets, etc
p48
aVWe first describe the use of the regexes in tree decomposition, and then give some examples of incorporating these regexes into the derivation trees
p49
aVWe trained the parser on sections 2-21 of OntoNotes WSJ, and parsed the three datasets with the gold tags, since at present we wish to analyze the parser performance in isolation from Part-of-Speech tagging errors
p50
aVTable 1 shows the sizes of the three corpora in terms of tokens and brackets, for both the gold and parsed versions, with the evalb scores for the parsed versions
p51
aVStructures with a CONJ/CONJP/NML child do not match this rule and are handled by different regexes, which are all mutually exclusive
p52
aVTable 1 shows the number and percentage of brackets handled by our regexes
p53
aVThe regexes allow us to also provide scores based on spans of different construction types
p54
aVOn PP attachment u'\u005cu201d' etc
p55
aV4 4 We do not have space here to discuss the data structure in complete detail, but multiple regex names at a node, such a VP-aux and VP-t at tree a3 in Figure 3 , indicate multiple VP nonterminals
p56
aVTo facilitate comparison of our analysis with evalb, we used corpora versions with the same bracket deletion (empty yields and most punctuation) as evalb
p57
aVThe nonterminals of the spinal etrees are the names of the regexes, with the simpler nonterminal labels trivially derivable from the regex names
p58
aVThere is a match for a regex if the corresponding words in gold/parser files project to that regex, a precision error if the parser file does but the gold does not, and a recall error if the gold does but the parser file does not
p59
aVSince this affects the F-s scores for VP-t, VP-aux, and S-vp, the negative effect is large
p60
aV(b) OntoNotes WSJ section 22, and (c) the u'\u005cu201c' Answers u'\u005cu201d' section of the English Web Treebank []
p61
aVFor example, comparing the trees in Figures 5 and 5 via their derivation trees in Figures 3 and Figures 3 , the word u'\u005cu201c' trip u'\u005cu201d' has a match for the regex NP-t, but a recall error for NP-modr
p62
aVHere we indicate with arrows that point to the relevant regex
p63
aVThe gold tree is shown without the SBJ function tag
p64
aVThe word u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' has a match for the regexes VP-t, VP-aux, and S-vp, and so on
p65
aVWe present the results in two ways
p66
aVRegexes ADJP-t and ADVP-t in (a) identify their terminal head to be the rightmost terminal, possibly preceded by some number of terminals or nonterminals, relying on a mapping that maps all terminals (except CC, which is mapped to CONJ) to TAG and all nonterminals (except CONJP and NML) to NT
p67
aVThese three results together show how the parser is generalizing from the training data, and what aspects of the u'\u005cu201c' domain adaptation u'\u005cu201d' problem to the web material are particularly important
p68
aV7 7 In future work we will compare our approach to that of , who also move beyond evalb scores in an effort to provide more meaningful error analysis
p69
aVThe regex names roughly describe their purpose - u'\u005cu201c' mod u'\u005cu201d' for right-modification, u'\u005cu201c' crd u'\u005cu201d' for coordination, etc
p70
aVFirst, inspired by the tradition of Tree Adjoining Grammar-based research [] , we use a decomposition of the full trees into u'\u005cu201c' elementary trees u'\u005cu201d' (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' etrees u'\u005cu201d' ), with a derivation tree that records how the etrees relate to each other, as in
p71
aVWe derived the regexes via an iterative process of inspection of tree decomposition on dataset (a), together with taking advantage of the treebanking experience from some of the co-authors
p72
aVSumming such scores over the corresponding gold/parser trees gives us F-scores for each regex
p73
aVThe high coverage (%) reinforces the point that there is a limited number of core structures in the treebank
p74
aVIn future work we will provide a full accounting of such cases, but they do not affect the main aspects of the analysis
p75
aVDecomposing the original phrase-structure tree into the smaller components requires some method of determining the u'\u005cu201c' head u'\u005cu201d' of a nonterminal, from among its children nodes, similar to parsing work such as
p76
aVFor example, the PP-t etree #a6 points to the NP-modr regex, which consists of the NP-t together with the PP-t
p77
aVThe suffix u'\u005cu201c' -t u'\u005cu201d' is for the simple non-recursive case in which the head is a terminal
p78
aVThe current work scores on general categories of structures, without the reliance on sequences of individual strings
p79
aVEach structure within a circle is one etree, and the derivation as a whole indicates how these etrees are combined
p80
aVThe names of these regexes are incorporated into the etrees themselves, as labels of the nonterminals
p81
aVPP
p82
aV3 3 Some among the 49 are duplicates, used for different nonterminals, as with (a) and (b) in Figure 1
p83
aVThis variance from the test-on-training dataset carries over almost exactly to Section 22
p84
aVThese are best thought of as an extension of head-finding rules, which not only find a head but simultaneously identify each parent/children relation as one of a limited number of types of structures (right-modification, etc
p85
aVWhile this metric serves a valuable purpose in pushing parser research forward, it has limited utility for understanding what sorts of errors a parser is making
p86
aVSecond, we use a set of regular expressions (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' regexes u'\u005cu201d' ) that categorize the possible structures in the treebank
p87
aVWe would also like to have answers to such questions as u'\u005cu201c' How does the parser do on non-recursive NPs, separate from NPs resulting from modification
p88
aVThe crucial step is that we integrate these regexes into the spinal etrees
p89
aVWe trained the parser on sections 2-21, and so (a) is u'\u005cu201c' test-on-train u'\u005cu201d'
p90
aV^(head:VP) (VP)* CONJ VP$
p91
aVAs described above, we are also interested in the type of linguistic construction represented by that one-level structure, each of which instantiates one of a few types - recursive coordination, simple head-and-sister, etc
p92
aVVP
p93
aVThere are 49 regexes used
p94
aVWe address both tasks together with the regexes
p95
aV2 2 We parse (c) while training on (a) to follow the procedure in
p96
aVIn sum, there is a wealth of information from this new type of analysis that we will use in our on-going work to better understand what the parser is learning and how it works on different genres
p97
aVHowever, that work did not utilize regexes, and focused on comparing sequences of identical strings
p98
aVAs this is work-in-progress, the analysis is not yet complete
p99
aVSpace prevents full explanation, but there are two reasons for this
p100
aVWe worked with the three datasets as described in the introduction
p101
aVThis work is in the same basic line of research as the inter-annotator agreement analysis work in
p102
aVIn contrast to the sort of head rules in [] , these refer as little as possible to specific POS tags
p103
aVInstead of explicitly listing the POS tags of possible heads, the heads are in most cases determined by their location in the structure
p104
aV8 8 We also combine a few other non-recursive regexes together with NP-t, such as the special one for possessives
p105
aVThis allows an etree to contain information such as u'\u005cu201c' this node represents right modification u'\u005cu201d'
p106
aVIn particular, we use the u'\u005cu201c' spinal u'\u005cu201d' structure approach of [] , where etrees are constrained to be unary-branching
p107
aVWe highlight a few points here
