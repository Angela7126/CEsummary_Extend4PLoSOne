<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As it can be seen, sentiment features obtains the best accuracy among the four types of features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Features described above mostly depict the global sentiment flow in the discussions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We thus split each discussion into three equal length stages, and create sentiment distribution and transition features for each stage</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Experimental results with various combinations of features sets are displayed in Table 5</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e., very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the dispute / non-dispute label for the discussion as a whole</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We then have features as number/portion of sentiment transitions per type</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Sentiment dependency relations are the dependency relations that include a sentiment word</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We further construct a local version of them, since sentiment distribution may change as discussion proceeds</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We choose number of turns ,</a>
