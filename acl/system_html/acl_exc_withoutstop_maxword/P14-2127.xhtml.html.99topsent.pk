VThe max-violation method performs the update where the model score difference between the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and the best y -good partial derivation is maximal, by penalizing the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and rewarding the y -good partial derivation
p1
aVSuch derivations can be generated in way similar to \u005cnewcite yu+:2013 by using a language model tailored for forced decoding
p2
aVOn the other hand, \u005cnewcite zhang+:2013 has generalized \u005cnewcite huang+:2012 from graphs to hypergraphs for bottom-up parsing, which resembles Hiero decoding
p3
aVFor clarity reasons we will describe Hiero decoding as a two-pass process, first without a language model, and then
