p1
aVPrevious research has shown that humans find it easier to reason about real-world scenarios than make abstract judgments [ 3 ]
p2
aVIntegration with VerbNet has additional benefits, since VerbNet itself is integrated with a variety of linguistic resources, such as PropBank and Penn TreeBank
p3
aVBecause we recruited large numbers of annotators, most of whom annotated only a few items, typical measures of inter-annotator agreement such as Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s kappa are not easily calculated
p4
aVIn fact, annotators frequently flagged these items as ungrammatical, which is a valuable result in itself for improving VerbNet
p5
aVIn principle, these judgments would come from naive annotators, since researchers u'\u005cu2019' intuitions about subtle judgments may be unconsciously clouded by theoretical commitments [ 4 ]
p6
aVThe Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predicates with the same syntactic properties were systematically related semantically

aVPrevious work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter,
