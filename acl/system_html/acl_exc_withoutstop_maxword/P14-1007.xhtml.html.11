<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our algorithm states that for this type of cue (a quantifier) the first step is functor crawling (see 3.3 below), which brings \spred _know_v_1 into the scope</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For negated verbs, the guidelines state that u'\u2018' u'\u2018' If the negated verb is the main verb in the sentence, the entire sentence is in scope u'\u2019' u'\u2019' [ 7 , 17]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This first type of genuine crawling failure often relates to cues expressed as affixation ( 4.3 ), as well as to rare usages of cue expressions that predominantly occur with different categories, e.g., neither as a generalized quantifier ( 4.3</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, the deep parsing front-end system to our MRS Crawler has not been adapted to the task or its text type; it is applied in an u'\u2018' off the shelf u'\u2019' setting</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others</a>
