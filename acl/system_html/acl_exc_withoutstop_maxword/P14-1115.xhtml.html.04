<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Considering the fact that the abstract sentences are automatically generated and the original sentences are human-written, the grammaticality score and the percentage of fully grammatical sentences generated by our system, with higher ROUGE or quality scores in comparison with other methods, demonstrates that our system is an effective phrasal query abstraction framework for both spoken and written conversations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>73% of the sentences generated by our phrasal query abstraction model are grammatically correct and 24% of the generated sentences are almost correct with only one grammatical error, while only 3% of the abstract sentences are grammatically incorrect</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The absolute improvement of 10% in precision for ROUGE-1 in our abstractive model over our extractive model (our pipeline) further confirms the effectiveness of our ranking method in generating the abstract sentences considering the query related information</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Query focus to identify the summary sentence with the highest coverage of query content, we propose a score that counts the number of query terms that appear in the path</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>3) TextRank a widely used graph-based ranking model for single-document sentence extraction that works by building a graph of all sentences in a document and use similarity as edges to compute the salience of sentences in the graph [ 22 ] ;</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In order to select and extract the informative summary-worthy utterances, based on the phrasal query and the original text, we consider two criteria i) utterances should carry the essence of the original text; and ii) utterances should be relevant to the query</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence</a>
