<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Also, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensemble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, because of the sarcasm in the second tweet (in u'\u201c' cold u'\u201d' pizza, an undesirable situation followed by a positive sentiment phrase u'\u201c' just what I wanted u'\u201d' , as discussed in Riloff et al.2013 ), it is more complex than the first for sentiment annotation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, u'\u201c' simple time measurement u'\u201d' is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using the idea of u'\u201c' annotation time u'\u201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We ensure the quality of our dataset in different ways a) Our annotators are instructed to avoid unnecessary head movements and eye-movements outside the experiment environment b) To minimize</a>
