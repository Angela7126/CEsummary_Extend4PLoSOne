<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One is based on the leftmost aligned word (leftmost reordering model) and the other is based on the rightmost aligned word (rightmost reordering model), as follows</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Of all the semantic role pairs, 44% are in the same CFG rules, indicating that this part of semantic reordering has overlap with syntactic reordering</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Before we present the algorithm integrating the reordering models, we define the following functions by assuming XP i and XP i + 1 are the constituent pair of interest in CFG rule cfg , H is the translation hypothesis and a is its word alignment</a>
