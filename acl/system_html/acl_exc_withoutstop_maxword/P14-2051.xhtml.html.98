<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to Sahlgren [ Sahlgren2008 ] , this kind of model captures to what extent words can be substituted for each other, which is a good measure of semantic similarity between verbs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These finding support the view that semantic density and type frequency, while they both positively influence syntactic productivity, do so in different ways density defines the necessary conditions for a new coinage to occur, while type frequency increases the confidence that this coinage is indeed possible</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One benefit of the distributional semantics approach is that it allows semantic similarity between words to be quantified by measuring the similarity in their distribution</a>
