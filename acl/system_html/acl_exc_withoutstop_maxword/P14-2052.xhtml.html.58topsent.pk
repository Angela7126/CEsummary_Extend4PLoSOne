VSubtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root
p1
aVOur method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree
p2
aVWe can set the candidate for the root node of the subtree by using constraint ( 7
p3
aVConstraints ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are tree constraints for a document tree and sentence trees r i u'\u005cu2062' j in Constraint ( 3 ) allows the system to extract non-rooted sentence subtrees, as we previously mentioned
p4
aVRooted sentence subtree only selects rooted sentence subtrees 2 2 We achieved this by making R c u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) only return the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root node in Figure 7
p5
aVThe sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges
p6
aVThe difference between the sentence subtree and the rooted sentence subtree methods was fairly small
p7
aVThe [ u'\u005cu22c5' ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree
p8
aVEach root EDU in a sentence has the parent EDU in another sentence
p9
aVWe can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence
