<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For multi-label verbs, the feature combination Lemma+LingInd+Inst leads to significant 5 improvement of 2% gain in accuracy over the baseline; Table 9 reports detailed class statistics and reveals a gain in F-measure of 3 points over the baseline</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that</a>
