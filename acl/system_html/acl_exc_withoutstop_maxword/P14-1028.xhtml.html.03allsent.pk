VIn our model, the bigram features are extracted in the window context and then the corresponding bigram embeddings are concatenated with character embeddings in Layer 1 and fed into Layer 2
p1
aVIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation
p2
aVwhere f u'\u005cu0398' ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] ) indicates the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters u'\u005cu0398' = ( M , A , W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2
p3
aVwhere f u'\u005cu0398' ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] , t i - 1 ) is the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters u'\u005cu0398'
p4
aVTo model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u005cu2208' T to tag j u'\u005cu2208' T

aVThe parameters of our model are u'\u005cu0398' = { W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2 , M , L , P [ 1
p9
aVWe propose a Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network for Chinese word segmentation without feature engineering
p10
aVExperiment results show that our model outperforms other neural network models
p11
aVAnother important result in Table 3 is that our neural network models perform much better than CRF-based model when only unigram features are used

p13
aVIn conventional neural network models, however, the input embeddings only implicitly interact through the non-linear function which can hardly model the complexity of the interactions
p14
aV[ 1 ] which learns the embeddings based on neural language model
p15
aVThe concatenation operation in Layer 1 then concatenates the character embeddings and tag embedding together into a long vector a
p16
aVWe further compare our model with previous neural network models on both PKU and MSRA datasets
p17
aVThe test results on the benchmark dataset show that our model outperforms previous neural network models
p18
aVSimilar to character embeddings, given a fixed-sized tag set T , the tag embeddings for tags are stored in a tag embedding matrix L u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d ×
p19
aVBy introducing tensor factorization into the neural network model for sequence labeling tasks, the model training and inference are speeded up and overfitting is prevented
p20
aVwhere the tag sequence is found and scored by the Tensor Neural Network via the function s in equation (6
p21
aVFormally, at the i -th character of a sentence c [ 1 n ] , the bigram features are c k c k + 1 ( i - 3 k i + 2
p22
aVThe character embeddings extracted by the Lookup Table layer are then concatenated into a single vector a u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 , where H 1 = w u'\u005cu22c5' d is the size of Layer 1
p23
aVMoreover, the transition score in equation (4) is not necessary in our model, because, by incorporating tag embedding into the neural network, the effect of tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction are covered uniformly in one same model
p24
aVDespite tensor-based transformation being effective for capturing the interactions, introducing tensor-based transformation into neural network models to solve sequence labeling task is time prohibitive since the tensor product operation drastically slows down the model
p25
aVMoreover, the simple non-linear transformation in equation (2) is also poor to model the complex interactional effects in Chinese word segmentation
p26
aVThe results are listed in the first three rows of Table 5, which shows that our model achieved higher F-score than the previous neural network models
p27
aV[ 35 ] followed the model proposed by Collobert et al
p28
aVSince vector a is the concatenation of character embeddings and the tag embedding, equation (7) can be written in the following form
p29
aVFor a character c u'\u005cu2208' D that has an associated index k , the corresponding character embedding E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d is retrieved by the Lookup Table layer as shown in Figure 1
p30
aV[ 15 ] , the bigram embeddings are pre-trained on unlabeled data with character embeddings, which significantly improves the model performance
p31
aVTo incorporate features into the neural network, Mansur et al
p32
aVThe character embeddings are then stacked into a embedding matrix M u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d ×
p33
aVThe complexity of the tensor operation is now O u'\u005cu2062' ( r u'\u005cu2062' H 1 u'\u005cu2062' H 2
p34
aVThe output of a tensor product is a vector z u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 2 where each dimension z i is the result of the bilinear form defined by each tensor slice V [ i ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 × H 1

p38
aVOur model learns the information automatically and encodes them in tensor parameters and embeddings
p39
aVThe final hyperparameters of our model are set as in Table 2
p40
aVFor a fast tag inference, only the previous tag t i - 1 is used in our model even though a longer history of tags can be considered
p41
aVIt is a competitive result given that our model only use simple bigram features while other models use more complex features
p42
aVTensor-based transformation was also used in other neural network models for its ability to capture multiple interactions in data
p43
aVA very common feature in Chinese word segmentation is the character bigram feature
p44
aV[ 15 ] proposed the feature-based neural network where each context feature is represented as feature embeddings
p45
aVwhere W 2 u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d'
p46
aVThen the output z i for each tensor slice i is the dot-product of f 1 and f 2
p47
aVRecently, researchers have tended to explore new approaches for word segmentation which circumvent the feature engineering by automatically learning features with neural network models [ 15 , 35 ]
p48
aVAssuming we are at the i -th character of a sentence, besides the character embeddings, the tag embeddings of the previous tags are also considered 1 1 We also tried the architecture in which the tag embedding of current tag is also considered, but this did not bring much improvement and runs slower
p49
aVWithout considering matrix optimization algorithms, the complexity of the non-linear transformation in equation (2) is O u'\u005cu2062' ( H 1 u'\u005cu2062' H 2 ) while the tensor operation complexity in equation (8) is O u'\u005cu2062' ( H 1 2 u'\u005cu2062' H 2
p50
aVIn previous neural network models, however, hardly can such interactional effects be fully captured relying only on the simple transition score and the single non-linear transformation (See section 2
p51
aVAn advantage of the tensor is that it can explicitly model multiple interactions in data

p54
aVFormally, each tensor slice V [ i ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 × H 1 is factorized into two low rank matrix P [ i ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 × r and Q [ i ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × H 1
p55
aVWe also compare our model with the CRF model [ 13 ] , which is a widely used log-linear model for Chinese word segmentation
p56
aVCompared with previous works that use a large number of handcrafted features, our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature engineering
p57
aVThe multiplicative operations between tag embeddings and character embeddings can somehow be seen as u'\u005cu201c' feature combination u'\u005cu201d' , which are hand-designed in feature-based models
p58
aVWe use the PKU and MSRA data provided by the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff [ 9 ] to test our model
p59
aVOur study is consistent with this line of research, however, our model explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters and accordingly captures more semantic information
p60
aVThey are commonly used by previous state-of-the-art models and neural network models
p61
aVFormally, in the Chinese word segmentation task, we have a character dictionary D of size
p62
aVTherefore, we integrate additional simple character bigram features into our model and the result shows that our model can achieve a competitive performance that other systems hardly achieve unless they use more complex task-specific features
p63
aVModel performance is further boosted after using tensor-based transformation
p64
aVMansur et al
p65

p66
aVFollowing Mansur et al
p67
aVMansur et al
p68
aVOur model still outperforms other models after pre-training
p69
aV[ 15 ] , we wonder how well our model can perform with minimal feature engineering
p70
aVTable 6 lists the segmentation performances of our model as well as previous state-of-the-art systems
p71
aVEach character c u'\u005cu2208' D is represented as a real-valued vector (character embedding) E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d where d is the dimensionality of the vector space
p72
aVTo explain why distributed representation captures more information than discrete features, we show in Table 4 the effect of character embeddings which are obtained from the lookup table of MMTNN after training
p73
aVMoreover, we propose a tensor factorization approach that effectively improves the model efficiency and prevents from overfitting
p74
aVThen the tag embedding E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d for tag t u'\u005cu2208' T with index k can be retrieved by the lookup operation
p75
aVSection 2 describes the details of conventional neural network architecture
p76
aVIn Chinese word segmentation, the most prevalent tag set T is BMES tag set, which uses 4 tags to carry word boundary information
p77
aVThe idea of feature embeddings is similar to that of character embeddings described in section 2.1
p78
aVThe input feature to the CRF model is simply the context characters (unigram feature) without any additional feature engineering
p79
aVZheng et al
p80
aVZheng et al
p81
aVSince Zheng et al
p82
aVObviously, it is a local model which cannot capture the dependency between tags and does not support to infer the tag sequence globally
p83
aVFirst, the discrete feature vector is replaced with dense character embeddings
p84
aVGiven the long time for pre-training bigram embeddings, we only pre-train the character embeddings and the bigram embeddings are initialized as the average of character embeddings of c k and c k + 1
p85
aVCombining the tensor product with linear transformation, the tensor-based transformation in Layer 2 is defined as
p86
aVCompared with CRF, there are two differences in neural network models
p87
aVWorkable as previous neural network models seem, a limitation of them to be pointed out is that the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction are not well modeled
p88
aVPrevious work found that the performance can be improved by pre-training the character embeddings on large unlabeled data and using the obtained embeddings to initialize the character lookup table instead of random initialization [ 15 , 35 ]
p89
aVMost previous systems address this problem by treating this task as a sequence labeling problem where each character is assigned a tag indicating its position in the word
p90
aVHowever, given the small size of their tensor matrix, they do not have the problem of high time cost and overfitting problem as we faced in modeling a sequence labeling task like Chinese word segmentation
p91
aVFollowing their idea, we try to find out how well our model can perform with minimal feature engineering
p92
aVRecently, neural network models have been increasingly focused on for their ability to minimize the effort in feature engineering
p93
aVAs we can see, in each tensor slice i , the embeddings are explicitly related in a bilinear form which captures the interactions between characters and tags
p94
aV[ 15 ] modeled Chinese word segmentation as a series of classification task at each position of the sentence in which the tag score is transformed into probability using softmax function
p95
aVThe object of Max-Margin training is that the highest scoring tag sequence is the correct one y * = y i and its score will be larger up to a margin to other possible tag sequences y ^ u'\u005cu2208' Y u'\u005cu2062' ( x i )
p96
aVT where d is the dimensionality of the vector space (same with character embeddings
p97
aVwhere y ^ m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' x is the tag sequence with the highest score in equation (13
p98
aVGiven an input sentence c [ 1 n ] , a window of size w slides over the sentence from character c 1 to c n
p99
aVTo better model the tag-tag interaction given the context characters, distributed representation for tags instead of traditional discrete symbolic representation is used in our model
p100
aVIn this way, the tag representation can be directly incorporated in the neural network so that the tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction can be explicitly modeled in deeper layers (See Section 3.2
p101
aVSection 3 describes the details of our model
p102
aVFirst, vector a is projected into two r -dimension vectors f 1 and f 2
p103
aVLike Collobert et al
p104
aVCollobert et al
p105
aVWe propose a new tensor factorization approach that models each tensor slice as the product of two low-rank matrices
p106
aVAs long as r is small enough, the factorized tensor operation would be much faster than the un-factorized one and the number of free parameters would also be much smaller, which prevent the model from overfitting
p107
aVAs a result, the model can still perform well even if some words do not appear in the training cases
p108
aVThe dimensionality of character (tag) embedding is set to 25 which achieved the best performance and faster than 50- or 100-dimensional ones
p109
aVMoreover, the additional tensor could bring millions of parameters to the model which makes the model suffer from the risk of overfitting
p110
aV[ 6 ] and Zheng et al
p111
aVWe will analyze in more detail about the effect of character embeddings in Section 4
p112
aVFormally, we use a 3-way tensor V [ 1
p113
aV[ 15 ] , their model is a global one where the training and inference is performed at sentence-level
p114
aVCompared with Mansur et al
p115
aVMikolov et al
p116
aVMikolov et al
p117
aVFor example, Socher et al
p118
aVFollowing Socher et al
p119
aVThe window approach assumes that the tag of a character largely depends on its neighboring characters
p120
aVWe use Y u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) to denote the set of all possible tag sequences for a given sentence x i and the correct tag sequence for x i is y i
p121
aVThe loss is proportional to the number of characters with an incorrect tag in the proposed tag sequence, which increases the more incorrect the proposed tag sequence is
p122
aVThe Lookup Table layer can be seen as a simple projection layer where the character embedding for each context character is achieved by table lookup operation according to their indices
p123
aVVarious tensor factorization (decomposition) methods have been proposed recently for tensor-based dimension reduction [ 4 , 29 , 2 ]
p124
aVAs shown in Figure 1, at position c i , 1 u'\u005cu2264' i u'\u005cu2264' n , the context characters are fed into the Lookup Table layer
p125
aVDespite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, our approach can be easily generalized to other sequence labeling tasks
p126
aVGiven the sentence-level score, Zheng et al
p127
aVFor a given training instance ( x i , y i ) , we search for the tag sequence with the highest score
p128
aVIn fact, equation (2) used in previous work is a special case of equation (8) when V is set to 0
p129
aVOur tensor factorization is related to these work but uses a different tensor factorization approach
p130
aV[ 35 ] did not report the results on the these datasets, we re-implemented their model and tested it on the test data
p131
aVFor model selection, we use the first 90 u'\u005cu2062' % sentences in the training data for training and the rest 10 u'\u005cu2062' % sentences as development data
p132
aVWe use the Max-Margin criterion to train our model
p133
aVThen each feature f u'\u005cu2208' D f is represented by a d -dimensional vector which is called feature embedding
p134
aVAs shown in Table 5 (last three rows), both the F-score and OOV recall of our model boost by using pre-training
p135
aV× 1 is a binary vector which is zero in all positions except at k -th index
p136
aVT is the score vector for each possible tag
p137
aV[ 16 ] proposed a faster skip-gram model word2vec 5 5 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/â which tries to maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence

aVFor example, Chang et al

aVFor example, Sun et al

aVHere e k u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d'
p143
aVwhere e k u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d'
p144
aVIn fact, CRF can be regarded as a special neural network without non-linear function [ 30 ]
p145
aV[ 35 ] , our model is also trained at sentence-level and carries out inference globally
p146
aVAs a result, tensor-based model have been widely used in a variety of tasks [ 20 , 12 , 23 ]
p147
aVWe first perform a close test 3 3 No other material or knowledge except the training data is allowed on the PKU dataset to show the effect of different model configurations
p148
aVIn linear models, these kinds of interactions are usually modeled as features
p149
aVAs we can see, by using Tag embedding, the F-score is improved by +0.6% and OOV recall is improved by +1.0%, which shows that tag embeddings succeed in modeling the tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction
p150
aVNot only does this approach improve the efficiency of our model but also it avoids the risk of overfitting
p151
aVUnless otherwise specified, the character dictionary is extracted from the training set and unknown characters are mapped to a special symbol that is not used elsewhere
p152
aVDespite sharing commonalities mentioned above, previous work models the segmentation task differently and therefore uses different training and inference procedure
p153
aVWhen bigram features are added, the F-score of our model improves from 94.0% to 95.2% on PKU dataset and from 94.9% to 97.2% on MSRA dataset
p154
aVThe model is then trained in MLE-style which maximizes the log-likelihood of the tagged data
p155
aVIn conventional feature-based linear (log-linear) models, these interactions are explicitly modeled as features
p156
aVDetails of the data are listed in Table 1
p157
aVIn Chinese word segmentation, a proper modeling of the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction is very important
p158
aVThey constructed a neural network that outputs high scores for windows that occur in the corpus and low scores for windows where one character is replaced by a random one
p159
aVThe idea of distributed representation for symbolic data is one of the most important reasons why the neural network works
p160
aVThe tensor-based transformation is H 1 times slower
p161
aVMost previous systems address this task by using linear statistical models with carefully designed features such as bigram features, punctuation information [ 14 ] and statistical information [ 24 ]
p162
aVThe tag embeddings start from a random initialization and can be automatically trained by back-propagation
p163
aVThe most popular approach treats word segmentation as a sequence labeling problem which was first proposed in Xue [ 31 ]
p164
aVHowever, the ability of these models is restricted by the design of features and the number of features could be so large that the result models are too large for practical use and prone to overfit on training corpus
p165
aVWe use this tag set in our method
p166
aVSince feature engineering is not the main focus of this paper, we did not experiment with more features
p167
aVWorkable as these methods seem, one of the limitations of them is that the tag-tag interaction and the neural network are modeled seperately
p168
aVIn each column, we list the top 5 characters that are nearest (measured by Euclidean distance) to the corresponding character in the first row according to their embeddings
p169
aVWe found that 50 is a good trade-off between speed and model performance
p170
aVSubstituting equation (9) into equation (8), we get the factorized tensor function
p171
aVAlthough we focus on the question that how far we can go without using feature engineering in this paper, the study of deep learning for NLP tasks is still a new area in which it is currently challenging to surpass the state-of-the-art without additional features
p172
aVAlthough we focus on the question that how far we can go without using feature engineering in this paper, the study of deep learning for NLP tasks is still a new area in which it is currently challenging to surpass the state-of-the-art without additional features
p173
aVTo remedy this, we propose a tensor factorization approach that factorizes each tensor slice as the product of two low-rank matrices
p174
aVWe also validated on the number of factors for tensor factorization
p175
aVFigure 4 illustrates the operation in each slice of the factorized tensor

aVWe use an open source toolkit CRF++ 4 4 http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html?source=navbar to train the CRF model
p187
aVChinese word segmentation has been studied with considerable efforts in the NLP community
p188
aVThese systems are effective because researchers can incorporate a large body of handcrafted features into the models
p189
aVWe pre-train the embeddings on the Chinese Giga-word corpus [ 10 ]
p190
aVTo capture more interactions, researchers have designed a large number of features based on linguistic intuition and statistical information
p191

p197
aVWe first define a structured margin loss u'\u005cu25b3' ( y i , y ^ ) for predicting a tag sequence y ^ for a given correct tag sequence y i
p198
aVThe simple tag-tag transition neglects the impact of context characters and thus limits the ability to capture flexible interactions between tags and context characters
p199
aV[ 35 ] proposed a perceptron-style training algorithm inspired by the work of Collins [ 5 ]
p200
aVTherefore, compared with discrete feature representations, distributed representation can capture the syntactic and semantic similarity between characters

aVwhere u'\u005cu0391' is the initial learning rate and g u'\u005cu03a4' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' u'\u005cu0398' i is the subgradient at time step u'\u005cu03a4' for parameter u'\u005cu0398' i
p202
aVThere are several ways to learn the embeddings on unlabeled data
p203
aVGiven the advantage of tensors, we apply a tensor-based transformation to the input vector
p204
aVThe F-score is improved by +0.6% while OOV recall is improved by +3.2%, which denotes that tensor-based transformation captures more interactional information than simple non-linear transformation

aVGiven a set of tags T of size
p209
aVIntuitively, we can interpret each slice of the tensor as capturing a specific type of tag-character interaction and character-character interaction
p210
aVThe performance is not boosted and the training time increases drastically when the number of factors is larger than 10
p211
aVIn this paper, we use word2vec because preliminary experiments did not show differences between performances of these models but word2vec is much faster to train
p212
aVIntuitively, the Max-Margin criterion provides an alternative to probabilistic, likelihood-based estimation methods by concentrating directly on the robustness of the decision boundary of a model [ 27 ]
p213
aVIt was proposed by Hinton [ 11 ] and has been a research hot spot for more than twenty years [ 1 , 6 , 21 , 16 ]

aVSecond, the non-linear transformation is used to discover higher level representation
p229
aVGenerally, the number of hidden units has a limited impact on the performance as long as it is large enough
p230
aVWe hypothesize that larger factor size results in too many parameters to train and hence perform worse
p231
aVThe characters exceeding the sentence boundaries are mapped to one of two special symbols, namely u'\u005cu201c' start u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' end u'\u005cu201d' symbols
