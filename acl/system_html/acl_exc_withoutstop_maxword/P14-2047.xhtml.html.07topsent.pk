VWe compare the translation quality obtained on segments with reference translation containing no discourse connective, exactly one discourse connective and more than one discourse connective
p1
aVThe ANOVA indicates that the number of connectives is not a significant factor for Arabic translation, but significantly impacts Chinese translation quality
p2
aVThe relation sense makes a significant difference in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic
p3
aVHere we study the influence of explicit discourse relations on machine translation quality and their interaction with 1-1 and 1-many segments
p4
aVWe identify explicit discourse connectives and their senses in the system translation and the human edited version of that translation
p5
aVHere we compare the translation quality of segments which contain ambiguous discourse connectives in the reference translation to those that do not
p6
aVThe test revealed that there is a significant difference in translation quality between 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but not for Arabic
p7
aVFor example, we compare the translation quality of segments that contain comparison relations in the reference translation with those that do not
p8
aVExplicit discourse relations such as comparison, contingency or
