<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore we propose handling ambiguous verbs separately</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To sum up, Inst features are essential for classifying multi-label verbs, and the LingInd features provide some useful prior</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Whether or not performance is improved by adding LingInd/Dist features, with their bias towards one aspectual class, depends on the verb type</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As Asp-MASC contains only few instances of each of the ambiguous verbs, we turn to the Asp-Ambig dataset</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the feature Lemma</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For multi-label verbs, the feature combination Lemma+LingInd+Inst leads to significant 5 improvement</a>
