<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Starting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the walk hits the current tree, the walk path is added to form a new tree with more nodes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One such sampling algorithm is the random walk sampler of Wilson ( 1996</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, we extend our model to a joint parsing and POS correction task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ideally, we would change multiple heads in the parse tree simultaneously, and sample those choices from the corresponding conditional distribution of p</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The general structure of our sampling algorithm is given in Figure 1</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We extend our model such that it jointly learns how to predict a parse tree and also correct the predicted POS tags for a better parsing</a>
