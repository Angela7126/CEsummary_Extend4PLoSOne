<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Combining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B+Z u'\u201d' ), we get the best performance on English, which is also significantly better than both co-training ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B u'\u201d' ) and tri-training ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B=Z u'\u201d' ) on both English and Chinese</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []</a>
