VNote that this phenomena of change in word senses has existed ever since the beginning of human communication [ Bamman and Crane2011 , Michel et al.2011 , Wijaya and Yeniterzi2011 , Mihalcea and Nastase2012 ] ; however, with the advent of modern technology and the availability of huge volumes of time-varying data it now has become possible to automatically track such changes and, thereby, help the lexicographers in word sense discovery, and design engineers in enhancing various NLP/IR applications (e.g.,, disambiguation, semantic search etc.) that are naturally sensitive to change in word senses
p1
aVColumns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u005cu2018' birth cluster u'\u005cu2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes
p2
aVWe, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change
p3
aVThe sense change detected was categorized as to whether it was a new sense (birth), a single sense got split into two or more senses (split) or two or more senses got merged (join) or a particular sense died (death
p4
aVSimilarly, for a candidate sense change from t u'\u005cu2062' v i to t u'\u005cu2062' v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t u'\u005cu2062' v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t u'\u005cu2062' v i with any time interval t u'\u005cu2062' v k , intermediate between t u'\u005cu2062' v i and t u'\u005cu2062' v j
p5
aVWord sense disambiguation as well as word sense discovery have both remained key areas of research right from the very early initiatives in natural language processing research
p6
aVRemarkably, comparison with the English WordNet indicates that in 44% cases, as identified by our algorithm, there has been a birth of a completely novel sense, in 46% cases a new sense has split off from an older sense and in 43% cases two or more older senses have merged in to form a new sense
p7
aVToward this objective we make the following contributions a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate
