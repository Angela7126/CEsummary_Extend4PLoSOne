VOwing to its ability to bring together features like multilinguality and increasing coverage, over the past few years resource alignment has proven beneficial to a wide spectrum of tasks, such as Semantic Parsing [ 33 ] , Semantic Role Labeling [ 28 ] , and Word Sense Disambiguation [ 25 ]

aVHowever, this alignment method still involves tuning of parameters which are highly dependent on the characteristics of the generated graphs and, hence, requires hand-crafted sense alignments for the specific pair of resources to be aligned, a task which has to be replicated every time the resources are updated

aVFor instance, WordNet can be readily represented as an undirected graph G whose nodes are synsets and edges are modeled after the relations between synsets defined in WordNet (e.g.,, hypernymy, meronymy, etc.), and u'\u005cu2112' G is the mapping between each synset node and the set of synonyms which express the concept
