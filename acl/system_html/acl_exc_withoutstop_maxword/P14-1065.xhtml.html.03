<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Group I contains our evaluation metrics, DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work, instead of proposing a new metric, we focus on enriching current MT evaluation metrics with discourse information</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Furthermore, when combined with individual metrics in group II, DR- lex is able to improve consistently over each one of them</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This suggests that both DR and DR- lex contain information that is complementary to that of the individual metrics that we experimented with</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In comparison to the syntactic and semantic extensions of MT metrics, there have been very few attempts to incorporate discourse information so far</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In this study, we evaluate to what extent existing evaluation metrics can benefit from additional discourse information</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Adding DR and DR- lex to the combinations manages to improve over five and four of the six tuned Asiya metrics, respectively</a>
