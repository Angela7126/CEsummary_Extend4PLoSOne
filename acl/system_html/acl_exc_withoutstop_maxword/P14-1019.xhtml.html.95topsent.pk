VJoint Parsing and POS Correction Table 3 shows the results of joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset, for our model and state-of-the-art systems
p1
aVThe reranker uses the same features as our model, along with the tree scores obtained from the MST parser (which is a standard practice in reranking
p2
aVHowever, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables
p3
aVBecause the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees
p4
aVComparison with Reranking As column 6 of Table 2 shows, our model outperforms the reranker by 1.3% 5 5 Note
