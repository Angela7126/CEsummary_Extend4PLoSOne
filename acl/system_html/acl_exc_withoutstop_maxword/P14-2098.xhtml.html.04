<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In addition to evaluating the merging algorithms on the stand-alone task of correction detection, we have also plugged in the merging algorithms into an end-to-end system in which every automatically detected correction is further classified into an error type</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Their approach has two components one to detect individual corrections within a revision, which they termed correction detection ; another to determine what the correction fixes, which they termed error type selection</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error</a>
