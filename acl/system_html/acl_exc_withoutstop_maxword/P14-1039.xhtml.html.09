<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this comparison, items where both fluency and adequacy were affected were counted as adequacy cases</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Of the cases where adequacy and fluency were not affected, contractions and subject-verb inversions were the most frequent differences</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The table also shows that differences in the order of VP constituents usually led to a change in adequacy or fluency, as did ordering changes within NPs, with noun-noun compounds and named entities as the most frequent subcategories of NP-ordering changes</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this analysis, we consider whether the reranked realization improves upon or detracts from realization quality u'\u2014' in terms of adequacy, fluency, both or neither u'\u2014' along with a linguistic categorization of the differences between the reranked realization and the original top-ranked realization according to the averaged perceptron model</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Additionally, in a targeted manual analysis, we find that in cases where the SVM reranker improves the BLEU score, improvements to fluency and adequacy are roughly balanced, while in cases where the BLEU score goes down, it is mostly fluency that is made worse (with reranking yielding an acceptable paraphrase roughly one third of the time in both cases</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>By contrast, with the 50 sentences where the BLEU score went down the most, adequacy was only affected 4 times, though fluency was affected 32 times, and 15 remained essentially unchanged</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In order to gain a better understanding of the successes and failures of our SVM ranker, we present here a targeted manual analysis of the development set sentences with the greatest change in BLEU scores, carried out by the second author (a native speaker</a>
