VSyntactic contexts capture different information than bag-of-word contexts, as we demonstrate using the sentence u'\u005cu201c' Australian scientist discovers star with telescope u'\u005cu201d'
p1
aVIn this paper we experiment with dependency-based syntactic contexts
p2
aVWe thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity
p3
aVAn alternative to the bag-of-words approach is to derive contexts based on the syntactic relations the word participates in
p4
aVTurney [ 31 ] described this distinction as domain similarity versus functional similarity
p5
aVThey capture relations to words that are far apart and thus u'\u005cu201c' out-of-reach u'\u005cu201d' with small window bag-of-words (e.g., the instrument of discover is telescope/prep_with ), and also filter out u'\u005cu201c' coincidental u'\u005cu201d' contexts which are within the window but not directly related to the target word (e.g., Australian
