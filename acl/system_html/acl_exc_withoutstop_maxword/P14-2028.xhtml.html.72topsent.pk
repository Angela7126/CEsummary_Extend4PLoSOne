VA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task

aVIn most cases, these are cognitive errors in loan words ( folsvagen u'\u005cu2192' volkswagen ), names of drugs ( vobemzin u'\u005cu2192' wobenzym ), names of brands ( scatcher u'\u005cu2192' skechers ), scientific terms ( heksagidron u'\u005cu2192' hexahedron ) and last names ( Shwartzneger u'\u005cu2192' Schwarzenegger

aVIts models are usually trained on large corpora and provide high effectiveness in correction of typical errors (most of which consist of 1-2 wrong characters per word), but does not work well for complex (multi-character) and infrequent errors

aVWhile choosing arg u'\u005cu2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language
