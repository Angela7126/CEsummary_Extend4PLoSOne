VIn particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e.,, links among mentions within entities) and response coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e.,, links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account
p1
aVHowever, when response mentions are not identical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) cannot be applied directly to systems with imperfect mentions

aVFor instance, if the key entities are { a,b,c } { d,e }; and the response entities are { b,c }
