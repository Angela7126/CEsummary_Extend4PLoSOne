<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u2019' s method</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Base features represent the basic properties of event causality like nouns, templates, and their excitation polarities (See Section LABEL:A-sec:base-features in the supplementary notes</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u2192' B u'\u2192' C from A u'\u2192' B and B u'\u2192' C</a>
