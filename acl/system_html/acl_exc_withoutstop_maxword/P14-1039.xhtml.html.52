<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To improve word ordering decisions, White Rajkumar [ 36 ] demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gibson u'\u2019' s [ 12 ] dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted human evaluation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In inspecting the results of reranking with this strategy, we observe that while it does sometimes succeed in avoiding egregious errors involving vicious ambiguities, common parsing mistakes such as PP-attachment errors lead to unnecessarily sacrificing conciseness or fluency in order to avoid ambiguities that would be easily tolerated by human readers</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A potential obstacle, of course, is that automatic parsers may not be sufficiently representative of human readers, insofar as errors that a parser makes may not be problematic for human comprehension; moreover, parsers are rarely successful in fully recovering the intended interpretation for sentences of moderate length, even with carefully edited news text</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we investigate whether Neumann van Noord u'\u2019' s brute-force strategy for avoiding ambiguities in surface realization can be updated to only avoid vicious ambiguities, extending (and revising) Van Deemter u'\u2019' s general strategy to all kinds of structural ambiguity, not just the one investigated by Khan et al</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In order to gain a better understanding of the successes and failures of our SVM ranker, we present here a targeted manual analysis of the development set sentences with the greatest change in BLEU scores, carried out by the second author (a native speaker</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A limitation of the experiments reported in this paper is that OpenCCG u'\u2019' s input semantic dependency graphs are not the same as the Stanford dependencies used with the Treebank parsers, and thus we have had to rely on the gold parses in</a>
