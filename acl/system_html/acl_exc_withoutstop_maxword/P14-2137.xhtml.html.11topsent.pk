VUnfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N
p1
aVOut of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations
p2
aVTherefore, we leverage relation temporality , which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality [ 8 , 6 , 16 ]
