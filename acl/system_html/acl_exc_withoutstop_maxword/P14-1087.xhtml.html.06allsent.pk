p5
aVTime Span Importance (TSI
p6
aVThen the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u005cu2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u005cu2062' S c
p7
aVThe timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering
p8
aVWe hypothesize that when more events happen within a particular time span, that time span is potentially more relevant for summarization
p9
aVSummarization
p10
aVSWING is a supervised, extractive summarization system which ranks sentences based on scores computed using a set of features in the Sentence Scoring phase
p11
aVThis corresponds to the number of time spans that the events in a sentence talk about
p12
aVIn Figure 5 , the sentences describe many events which took place within the same time span
p13
aVSentences that mention events found in such a time span should be assigned higher scores
p14
aVIn Figure 4 , taking reference from event e (shaded in black), the left peak to the time span which e is in happens to be time span A , while the right peak is time span A + 4
p15
aVTemporal Processing generates timelines from text, one for each input document
p16
aVT u'\u005cu2062' S w is the number of events within the time span
p17
aVReferring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall
p18
aVAs a simplifying assumption, events are laid out on the timeline based on the starting time of their time span
p19
aVEvents which appear to the left of others take place earlier, while events within the same time span happen together over the same time period
p20
aVSentence Temporal Coverage Density (TCD
p21
aVThe importance of a time span may not depend solely on the number of events that happen within it
p22
aVTemporal processing is imperfect
p23
aVIt is imaginable that this can be useful information to be included in a summary, even though from looking at the corresponding timeline in Figure 2 , the u'\u005cu201c' evacuated u'\u005cu201d' event falls in a time span with a low importance score (i.e.,, the time span only has one event
p24
aVTo incorporate temporal information into multi-document summarization, we adopt the workflow in Figure 3 , which has two key processes
p25
aVLet T u'\u005cu2062' S L be the time span with the largest number of events in a timeline
p26
aVIn this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling
p27
aVAssigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone
p28
aVGeneralizing, we refer to the time period an event takes place in as its time span (vertical dotted lines
p29
aV2010 ) , results from the three temporal processing steps
p30
aVWe first define the temporal coverage of a sentence
p31
aVFormally, the contextual time span importance of a word w can be expressed as
p32
aVWe derive the CTSI of a sentence by first computing the contextual importance of words in the sentence
p33
aV1) timex normalization, 2) event-timex temporal relationship classification, and 3) event-event temporal relationship classification, are merged to obtain timelines (top half of Figure 3
p34
aVIn this work we construct timelines (as a representation of temporal information) automatically and incorporate them into a state-of-the-art multi-document summarization system
p35
aVTo motivate how temporal information can be useful in summarization, let us refer to Figure 1
p36
aVTCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e., if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts
p37
aV1) events, and 2) time expressions (or timexes for short
p38
aVThe Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm is then used in the Sentence Re-ordering phase to re-order and select sentences to form the final summary
p39
aVThe timeline can be viewed as a continuum of time, with points on the timeline referring to specific moments of time
p40
aVWe make use of a state-of-the-art summarization system, SWING [ 16 ] (bottom half of Figure 3
p41
aVTwo events are said to be in the same time span if one happens within the time period the other happens in
p42
aVHowever his approach is guided by the number of events happening within the same time span, and relies on event co-referencing
p43
aVNote that in our work, time spans may not correspond to specific instances of time, but instead help in inferring an ordering of events
p44
aVThey indicate the temporal relationships between two basic temporal units
p45
aVThrough these, we demonstrate that temporal information is useful for multi-document summarization
p46
aVIn this paper, we present our work in incorporating the use of such temporal information into multi-document summarization
p47
aVThe importance of a time span T u'\u005cu2062' S i is computed by normalizing the number of events in T u'\u005cu2062' S i against the number of events in T u'\u005cu2062' S L
p48
aVThe T u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' I of a sentence s is then the sum of the time span importance associated to all the words in s
p49
aVReferring to Figure 4 , suppose a sentence contains the three events which have been shaded black
p50
aVEvents within a document set correspond to vertices in their proposed graph, while edges are determined by the temporal ordering of events
p51
aVFigure 2 illustrates a possible timeline laid out with the events found in Figure 1
p52
aVThe CTSI of a sentence is computed as
p53
aVAfter laying out these events onto a timeline by making use of these timestamps, the number of events that happen within the same day is used to influence sentence scoring
p54
aVCTSI recognizes that events which happen around the time of a big cluster of other events can be important too
p55
aVIn the sentence re-ordering stage of the SWING pipeline, the iterative MMR algorithm is used to adjust the score of a candidate sentence, s
p56
aVBoth sentences score similarly for the SWING features of sentence position (SP), sentence length (Length), and interpolated n-gram document frequency (INDF); however, the scores for all three timeline features higher for ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 2) than ( u'\u005cu211d' 2
p57
aVThe two events inside ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 3) fall in time spans A and B marked in the figure
p58
aVThus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary
p59
aVIncorporating temporal information can potentially improve this
p60
aVVisualized on a timeline, this will translate to more events (bolded in Figure 1 ) around the time when the recent storm occurred
p61
aVIf it is near time spans which are u'\u005cu201c' important u'\u005cu201d' (i.e.,, one that has a large number of events), it should also be of relative importance
p62
aVBy doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal information, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur
p63
aVThe time spans are ordered in the sequence they appear on the timeline
p64
aVThus, we propose further penalizing the score of s if it contains events that happen in similar time spans as those contained in sentences within S
p65
aV1999 ) were one of the first to use time for multi-document summarization
p66
aVThey estimated the chronological ordering of events with a small set of heuristics, and also made use of lexical patterns to perform basic time normalization on terms like u'\u005cu201c' today u'\u005cu201d' relative to the document creation time
p67
aVWe define the contextual importance of a word found in time span T u'\u005cu2062' S i as a weighted sum of the time span importance of the two nearest peaks T u'\u005cu2062' S l u'\u005cu2062' p and T u'\u005cu2062' S r u'\u005cu2062' p found to the left and right of T u'\u005cu2062' S i , respectively
p68
aVHe had also made use of temporal information to weight sentences to generate summaries
p69
aVAs the threshold increases from 0 to 40 u'\u005cu2013' 50, summarization performance improves while the number of document sets where temporal information is used is reduced
p70
aVEvents can either occur at a specific instance of time (e.g.,, an explosion), or over a period of time (e.g., a football match
p71
aVWe assume that the various input document sets to be summarized are available at the time of processing
p72
aVThe events from the more recent storm are found together at the same time
p73
aVThere should be fewer events mentioned in the collection for the earlier 1991 time period
p74
aVWe hope to improve the quality of the summaries that are generated by considering temporal information found in the input text
p75
aVRecall that TimeMMR seeks to eliminate redundancy based on time span similarities and not lexical likeness
p76
aVTogether with the simplifying assumptions that were made in timeline construction, our generated timelines have errors which propagate into the summarization process
p77
aVTimelines are well-understood constructs which have often been used to represent temporal information [ 7 , 8 ]
p78
aVWe derive three features from the constructed timelines, which are then used for downstream Sentence Scoring
p79
aVSince the focus of this paper is on multi-document summarization, we employ only the three generic features, i.e.,, 1) sentence position, 2) sentence length, and 3) interpolated n-gram document frequency in our experiments below
p80
aVFormally, if a sentence s contains events u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' s = { e 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , e n } , where each event is associated with a time span T u'\u005cu2062' S i , then T u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' D is computed using
p81
aVWhile TimeMMR is proposed here as an improvement over MMR, the premise is that incorporating temporal information can be helpful to minimize redundancy in summaries
p82
aVThis is not the same as our approach here, which makes use of temporal information encoded in timelines to generate prose summaries
p83
aVA useful note here is that this work is arguably different from the Temporal Summarization (TmpSum) track at the Text Retrieval Conference [ 1 ]
p84
aVwhere T u'\u005cu2062' S w is the time span associated with w
p85
aVwhere T u'\u005cu2062' S w denotes the time span which a word w is associated with, and
p86
aVA typical timeline used in this work has been shown earlier in Figure 2
p87
aVSuppose a sentence contains events which are associated with time spans T u'\u005cu2062' S a , T u'\u005cu2062' S b , T u'\u005cu2062' S c
p88
aVThe constraint on the number of sentences that can be included in a summary requires us to select compact sentences which contain as many relevant facts as possible
p89
aVThe higher R-2 score obtained by the summary on the left (0.0873) compared to the one on the right (0.0723) suggests that temporal information can help to identify salient sentences more accurately
p90
aVIn the table, each row refers to a specific summarization system configuration
p91
aVThe black square boxes above the timeline denote events
p92
aVThe intuition for this is that for longer timelines (which contain more events), possible errors are spread over the entire timeline, and do not overpower any useful signal that can be obtained from the timeline features outlined earlier
p93
aVwhere S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s ) is the score of s , S is the set of sentences already selected to be in the summary from previous iterations, and R u'\u005cu2062' 2 is the predicted ROUGE-2 score of s with respect to the already selected sentences ( S u'\u005cu0393' is a weighting parameter which is empirically set to 0.9 after tuning over a development dataset u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' is the proportion of events in s which happen in the same time span as another event in any other sentence in S
p94
aVIn this work, we adopt the definitions proposed in the standardized TimeML annotation [ 21 ]
p95
aVIn sentence re-ordering, final summaries are re-arranged so that the extracted sentences that form the summary are in a chronological order
p96
aVOur work is significant as it addresses an important gap in the exploitation of temporal information
p97
aVThis is achieved with 1) three novel features derived from timelines to help measure the saliency of sentences, as well as 2) TimeMMR , a modification to the traditional Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [ 3 ]
p98
aVThey recognized the importance of generating a summary which presents the time perspective of the summarized documents correctly
p99
aVFigure 6 shows the raw feature scores of both sentences
p100
aVIt turns out that this sentence was lifted exactly in one of the model summaries for this document set, resulting in a very good R-2 score when contextual importance is used
p101
aVAutomatic temporal processing systems are not perfect yet, and this may have an impact on their use for downstream applications
p102
aV2009 ) proposed an interesting approach using a temporal graph
p103
aVFigure 8 shows the last sentences from a pair of summaries generated with and without the use of TSI (all other sentences were the same
p104
aVTraditional lexical measures may attempt to achieve this by computing the ratio of keyphrases to the number of words in a sentence [ 11 ]
p105
aVSWING makes use of three generic features and two features targeted specifically at guided summarization
p106
aVI l u'\u005cu2062' p and I r u'\u005cu2062' p are the time span importance of the peaks to the left and right of T u'\u005cu2062' S w respectively, while
p107
aVThis boost results in the sentence being selected for inclusion in the final summary
p108
aVSince ( u'\u005cu211d' 1) and ( u'\u005cu211d' 3) talk about the same time span, TimeMMR down-weights ( u'\u005cu211d' 3
p109
aVWhile there has been prior work making use of temporal information for multi-document summarization, they 1) have been largely confined to helping to chronologically order content within summaries [ 2 ] , or 2) focus only on the use of recency as an indicator of saliency [ 10 , 27 ]
p110
aVWe believe our understanding of the temporal information found in text is sufficiently robust, and that there is an opportunity to now leverage this information in downstream applications
p111
aVFigure 4 shows a simplified timeline, along with annotations that are referenced in this section to help explain how these timeline features are derived
p112
aVCTSI seeks to promote sentences such as this
p113
aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' s is the number of events found in s , and
p114
aVThis suggests that filtering is successful in identifying timelines that are not sufficiently accurate to be useful for summarization
p115
aV2000 ) made use of the temporal ordering of documents to be summarized
p116
aVTheir proximity to the peak P between them gives the sentence a higher score for CTSI
p117
aVTimeMMR promotes diversity by additionally considering temporal information instead of just lexical similarities
p118
aVThe goal of multi-document summarization is to generate a summary which includes the main points from an input collection of documents with minimal repetition of similar points
p119
aVThis helps our time sensitive system prefer ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 2
p120
aVAn event refers to an eventuality, a situation that occurs or an action; while a timex is a reference to a particular date or time (e.g., u'\u005cu201c' 2013 December 31 u'\u005cu201d'
p121
aV2010 ) made similar assumptions in their work on TimedTextRank and entity summarization, respectively
p122
aVT u'\u005cu2062' S r u'\u005cu2062' p - T u'\u005cu2062' S w are the number of time spans between the left and right peaks of T u'\u005cu2062' S w respectively u'\u005cu0391' balances the importance of the left and right peaks, intuitively set to 0.5
p123
aVSentence (2) explains that a lot of people have been evacuated prior to the cyclone making landfall
p124
aVAt these higher thresholds, temporal information is still able to help get an improvement in R-2
p125
aVSummarization evaluation is done using ROUGE-2 (R-2) [ 13 ] , as it has previously been shown to correlate well with human assessment [ 14 ] and is often used to evaluate automatic text summarization
p126
aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' s denotes the set of events words in s
p127
aVFigure 10 shows an extract of the timeline generated for the source document from which ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 3) is extracted
p128
aVThe motivating idea is to reduce repeated information by preferring sentences which bring in new facts
p129
aVThe use of recency as an indicator of saliency is useful, yet disregards other accessible temporal information
p130
aVAs the state-of-the-art improves, these workshops have moved away from the piecemeal evaluation of individual temporal processing tasks and towards the evaluation of complete end-to-end systems in TempEval-3
p131
aVThe left one is produced by the configuration in Row 9, and the right one is produced by SWING without the use of any temporal information
p132
aVWe now examine the proposed 1) timeline features, 2) TimeMMR algorithm, and 3) reliability filtering metric in greater detail to gain insight into their efficacy
p133
aVWe incorporate this into our process as follows given an input document collection (which consists of 10 documents), the average size of all the timelines for each of these 10 documents is computed
p134
aVThe proposed timeline features and TimeMMR were implemented on top of SWING , and evaluated on the test documents from TAC-2011 [ 19 ]
p135
aVThis work additionally proposes the use of the lengths of timelines as a metric to gauge the usefulness of timelines
p136
aVErrors are however very easily propagated into summary generation for shorter timelines, leading to less useful results
p137
aVSmall solid blocks on the timeline itself are references to absolute timestamps along the timeline (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' 2013-Feb-13 11:32 +0000 u'\u005cu201d' in the figure
p138
aVThe ablation test results in Rows 2 to 4 show a drop in R-2 each time a feature is left out
p139
aVT u'\u005cu2062' S n - T u'\u005cu2062' S 1 is the temporal coverage of s
p140
aVHe assigned complete timestamps to events extracted from text
p141
aVGiven a large stream of data in real-time, the purpose of the TmpSum track is to look out for a query event, and retrieve specific details about the event over a period of time
p142
aVT =0 means that timelines are used for all input document sets, whereas T =100 means that no timelines are used, as the length of the longest timeline is less than 100
p143
aVRows 9 to 16 additionally incorporate our timeline reliability filtering
p144
aVIn this work, we have simplified this idea by dropping the need for event co-referencing (removing a source of propagated error), and augmented it with two additional features derived from timelines
p145
aVThere are fewer events which talk about the previous storm
p146
aVWe postulate that the length of a timeline can serve as a simple reliability filtering metric
p147
aVHence in these experiments, the threshold for filtering is set to be the average of all the timeline sizes over the whole input dataset
p148
aVWu ( 2008 ) also made use of the relative ordering of events
p149
aVThere has been a good amount of research invested into improving the temporal interpretation of text
p150
aVTogether with the earlier described contributions, this metric further improves summarization, yielding an overall 5.9% performance increase
p151
aVThe three sentences describe a recent cyclone and a previous one which happened in 1991
p152
aVModifying the MMR equation from Ng et al
p153
aVThis can be done by computing a metric which can be used to decide whether or not timelines should be used for a particular input document collection
p154
aVThe motivation behind this approach is that days which have a large number of events should be more important and more worthy of reporting than others
p155
aVWe tap on existing systems for each of these steps [ 18 , 23 , 17 ]
p156
aVIf a summary of a whole sequence of events is desired, recency becomes less useful
p157
aVFrom the resulting weakly-connected graph, the largest forests are assumed to contain key topics within the document set and used to influence a scoring mechanism which prefers sentences touching on these topics
p158
aVHowever it is not trivial for the lexically-motivated MMR algorithm to detect that events like u'\u005cu201c' passed u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' uprooted u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' damaged u'\u005cu201d' are in fact repetitive
p159
aVThe summary on the left is generated using TimeMMR and achieved a lower ROUGE score
p160
aVFor the analysis on timeline features, we only present an analysis for TSI and CTSI due to space constraints
p161
aVRecognizing that sentence (3) is about a storm that had happened in the past is important when writing a summary about the recent storm, as it is not relevant and can likely be excluded
p162
aVWe chose to use MMR here as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of such a technique, and to easily integrate our work into SWING
p163
aVThe arrowed, horizontal axis is the timeline itself
p164
aVThe summary on the left achieved a R-2 score of 0.1215 while the one on the right achieved 0.0861 u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 2) and ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 3) were both boosted by the use of the contextual importance feature
p165
aVThis affirms our use of the average length of timelines as the threshold value in our earlier experiments
p166
aVTo help visualize what the differences in these ROUGE scores mean, Figure 7 shows two summaries 1 1 The produced summaries are truncated to fit within a 100-word limit imposed by the TAC-2011 guidelines generated for document set D1117C of the TAC-2011 dataset
p167
aVIt is able to guide the use of timelines such that significant improvements in R-2 over SWING are obtained
p168
aVA summary about the hurricane need not contain all of these sentences as they are all describing the same thing
p169
aVWe refer to this as reliability filtering
p170
aVIn computing the relevance of a passage for inclusion into the final summary, they considered the recency of the passage u'\u005cu2019' s source document
p171
aVA more concrete illustration of this can also be seen in Figure 1
p172
aVWith this in mind, we selectively employ timelines to generate summaries only when we are confident of their accuracy
p173
aVThe work of Wu ( 2008 ) is closely related to one of the features proposed in this paper
p174
aVIn each iteration, s is penalized if it is lexically similar to other sentences that have already been selected to form the eventual summary S = { s 1 , s 2 , u'\u005cu2026' }
p175
aVThese prior works target either 1) sentence re-ordering, or 2) the use of recency as an indicator of saliency
p176
aVStated equivalently, when two sentences are of the same length, if one contains more keyphrases, it should contain more useful facts
p177
aVAn interesting case in point is given in Figure 11
p178
aVWe refer to this as TimeMMR
p179
aVSystems are also expected to identify the source sentences from which these details are retrieved
p180
aVRow 1 shows the usefulness of the proposed timeline-based features

aVThey describe the destruction caused by a hurricane with trees uprooted and buildings blown away

aVA statistically significant improvement of 4.1% is obtained with the use of all three features over SWING
p187
aVThe benefits of this feature can be clearly seen in Figure 9

aVIn another line of work, Goldstein et al
p189
aVThe results obtained are shown in Table 1
p190
aVIn future work, one could apply it to other state-of-the-art lexical-based approaches including that of Hendrickx et al
p191
aVBeyond 60, the R-2 scores are still higher than that obtained by SWING , but no longer significantly different
p192
aVDepending on the style of writing or journalistic guidelines, a summary can arguably be written in a number of ways
p193
aVFrom these results, we can see that SWING is a very competitive baseline
p194
aVA closer look at sentences ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 2) and ( u'\u005cu211d' 2) and their R-2 scores (0.0424 and 0.0249, respectively) is instructive
p195
aVOnly when this value is larger than a threshold value are the timelines used
p196
aVHowever as this affects only very few out of the 44 document sets, statistical variances mean that these R-2 scores are no longer significant from that produced by SWING
p197
aVFor example, an event that takes place in u'\u005cu201c' 2014 June u'\u005cu201d' is said to take place within the year u'\u005cu201c' 2014 u'\u005cu201d'
p198
aVThe induced ordering is used to present the selected summary content, following the chronological order in the original documents
p199
aVIt is easy to see why ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd43' 1) scores higher for R-2 u'\u005cu2014' it describes the cause of the accident just as it occurred u'\u005cu211d' 1) however talks about events which happened before the accident itself (e.g.,, how much of the tower had already been erected
p200
aVIn a production environment where this assumption may not hold, this threshold could be set by empirical tuning over a development set
p201
aVWe also believe the same idea can be transplanted even to non-lexical motivated techniques such as the corpus-based similarity measure proposed by Xie and Liu ( 2008
p202
aVThese indicate that all the proposed features are important and need to be used together to be effective
p203
aVWe also show the results of two reference systems, CLASSY [ 5 ] and POLYCOM [ 30 ] , as benchmarks
p204
aVIt is reasonable to expect that a collection of documents about the recent storm will contain more references to it, compared with the earlier one that happened in 1991
