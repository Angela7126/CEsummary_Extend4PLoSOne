VIn the coarse pass, we compute Viterbi inside and outside scores for every span
p1
aVBecause the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass
p2
aVThus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u005cu2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u005cu2019' s scores
p3
aVMBR algorithms for parsing do not compute the best derivation, as in Viterbi parsing, but instead the parse tree that maximizes the expected count of some figure of merit
p4
aVTogether these kernels implement the Viterbi inside algorithm
p5
aVThe Viterbi algorithm is a reasonably effective method for parsing
p6
aVPetrov and Klein ( 2007 ) showed that MBR trees substantially improved performance over Viterbi parses for latent variable grammars, earning up to 1.5F1
p7
aVThis algorithm maximizes the expected number of correct coarse symbols ( A , i , j ) with respect to the posterior distribution over parses for a sentence
