VRecall that LP only takes into account source similarity; since the vast majority of generated candidates do not occur as labeled neighbors u'\u005cu2019' labels, restricting propagation to the source graph drastically reduces the usage of generated candidates as labels, but does not completely eliminate it
p1
aVThe idea presented in this paper is similar in spirit to bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), where a seed lexicon in two different languages is expanded with the help of monolingual corpora, primarily by extracting distributional similarities from the data using word context
p2
aVTo determine pairwise phrase similarities in order to embed these nodes in their graphs, we utilize the monolingual corpora on both the source and target sides to extract distributional features based on the context surrounding each phrase
