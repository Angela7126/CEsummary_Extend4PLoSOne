VIn case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update
p1
aVBuilding on prior work in grounded semantic parsing, we generate translations of queries, and receive feedback by executing semantic parses of translated queries against the database
p2
aVWe show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning
p3
aVLexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning
p4
aVThe structured perceptron algorithm [ Collins2002 ] learns an optimal weight vector w by updating w on input x ( i ) by the following rule, in case the predicted translation y ^ is different from and scored higher than the reference translation y ( i )
p5
aVIn case of negative feedback, a structural update can be performed
