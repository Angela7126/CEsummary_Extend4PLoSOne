<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Note that the above step is also known as probability integral transform [ 11 ] , which allows us to convert any given continuous distribution to random variables having a uniform distribution</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By applying the Probability Integral Transform to raw features in the copula model, we essentially avoid comparing apples and oranges in the feature space, which is a common problem in bag-of-features models in NLP</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From an information-theoretic point of view [ 38 ] , various problems in text analytics can be formulated as estimating the probability mass/density functions of tokens in text</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, when bag-of-word-unigrams are present in the feature space, it is easier if one does not explicitly model the stochastic dependencies among the words, even though doing so might hurt the predictive power, while the variance from the correlations among the random variables is not explained</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By doing this, we are essentially performing probability integral transform u'\u2014' an important statistical technique that moves beyond the count-based bag-of-words feature space to marginal cumulative density functions space</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that since the kernel density estimation in the proposed copula model is nonparametric, and we only need to learn the u'\u03a3' in the Gaussian copula, there is no hyperparameters that need to be tuned</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Finally, we investigate the robustness of the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula regression model by varying the amount</a>
