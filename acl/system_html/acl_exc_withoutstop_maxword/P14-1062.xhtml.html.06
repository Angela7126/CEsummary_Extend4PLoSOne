<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We model sentences using a convolutional architecture that alternates wide convolutional layers with dynamic pooling layers given by dynamic k -max pooling</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Multiple layers of convolutional and dynamic pooling operations induce a structured feature graph over the input sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We next describe a pooling operation that is a generalisation of the max pooling over the time dimension used in the Max-TDNN sentence model and different from the local max pooling operations applied in a convolutional network for object recognition []</a>
