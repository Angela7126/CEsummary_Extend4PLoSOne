p5
aVWe consider evaluating our lexicons on the consistency of Wikipedia pages about a particular individual person among various languages
p6
aVThe sentiment polarity of a page is simply computed by subtracting the number of negative words from that of positive words, divided by the sum of both
p7
aVWe seek to identify as many semantic links across languages as possible to connect our network, and so integrated several resources
p8
aVLinks do not always agree in a bidirectional manner, particularly for multi-sense words, thus all links in our network are unidirectional
p9
aVAs our candidate entities for analysis, we use the Wikipedia pages of 2,000 most significant people as measured in the recent book Who u'\u005cu2019' s Bigger

p43
aVTo avoid potential overfitting problems, grid search starts from SentiWordNet English lexicons [ 9 ] instead of Liu u'\u005cu2019' s
p44
aVLiu u'\u005cu2019' s lexicons contain 2006 positive words and 4783 negative words
p45
aVLarge-Scale Language Knowledge Graph Analysis u'\u005cu2013' We have created a massive comprehensive knowledge graph of 7 million vocabulary words from 136 languages with over 131 million semantic inter-language links, which proves valuable when doing alignment between definitions in different languages
p46
aVWe conducted a grid search on the weight of each type of links to maximize the best overall accuracy on our test data of published non-English sentiment lexicons
p47
aVSentiment analysis of English texts has become a large and active research area, with many commercial applications, but the barrier of language limits the ability to assess the sentiment of most of the world u'\u005cu2019' s population
p48
aV2010 ) create powerful word embedding by training on real and corrupted phrases, optimizing for the replaceability of words
p49
aVThrough semantic links in our knowledge graph, words are able to extend their sentiment polarities to adjacent neighbors
p50
aVIndeed, our literature search identified only 12 publicly available sentiment lexicons for only 5 non-English languages (Chinese mandarin, German, Arabic, Japanese and Italian
p51
aVExcellent surveys of the field include [ 18 , 21 ] , establishing that rich online resources have greatly expanded opportunities for opinion mining and sentiment analysis
p52
aVExtrinsic Evaluation u'\u005cu2013' We elucidate the sentiment consistency of entities reported in different language editions of Wikipedia using our propagated lexicons
p53
aVWe validate our own work through other publicly available, human annotated sentiment lexicons
p54
aVOf these, 1422 positive words and 2956 negative words (roughly 64.5%) appear among the 100,000 English vertices in our graph
p55
aVWordNet u'\u005cu2013' Finally, we gather synonyms and antonyms of English words from WordNet, which prove particularly useful in propagating sentiment across languages
p56
aVTable 2 reveals that very sparse sentiment lexicons resulted for a small but notable fraction of the languages we analyzed
p57
aV2008 ) extract specific language features of Arabic which requires language-specific knowledge
p58
aVResearchers have investigated topic or domain dependent approaches to identify opinions
p59
aVThe differing ratio of positive and negative polarity terms in Table 2 means that sentiment cannot be directly compared across languages
p60
aVIn particular we ask for translations of each word in our English vocabulary to 57 languages with available translators as well as going from each known vocabulary word in other languages to English
p61
aVAlthough several well-regarded sentiment lexicons are available in English [ 9 , 17 ] , the same is not true for most of the world u'\u005cu2019' s languages
p62
aVBoth models achieve similar accuracy while slightly more words in graph propagation can be verified via published lexicons
p63
aVIn this paper, we strive to produce a comprehensive set of sentiment lexicons for the worlds u'\u005cu2019' major languages
p64
aVFinally, in Section 6 we present our extrinsic evaluation of sentiment consistency in Wikipedia prior to our conclusions

p66
aV2007 ) learn multilingual subjectivity via cross-lingual projections
p67
aVBy contrast, 48 languages had lexicons with over 2,000 words, another 16 with between 1,000 and 2,000 clearly large enough to perform a meaningful analysis
p68
aVAll pairs of language exhibit positive correlation (and hence generally stable and consistent sentiment), with an average correlation of 0.28
p69
aVIn this section we will describe how we leverage off a variety of NLP resources to construct the semantic connection graph we will use to propagate sentiment lexicons
p70
aVWe report results from using Liu u'\u005cu2019' s lexicons [ 17 ] as seed words
p71
aVAn edge gains zero weight if both negative and positive links exist
p72
aVIn total, machine translation provides 53.2% of the total links and establishes connections between 3.5 million vertices
p73
aVWe use the Spearman correlation coefficient to measure the consistence of sentiment distribution across all entities with pages in a particular language pair
p74
aVEdges having multiple positive links will be credited the highest weight among all these links
p75
aVMachine Translation - We script the Google translation API to get even more semantic links
p76
aVFinally, Table 3 illustrates sentiment consistency over all 136 languages (represented by blue tick marks), with the first 10 languages in Figure 2 granted labels
p77
aVIndeed, our lexicons have polarity agreement of 95.7% with these published lexicons, plus an overall coverage of 45.2%
p78
aVIn particular, only 20 languages yielded lexicons of less than 100 words
p79
aVIn particular, we collect total of 7,741,544 high-frequency words from 136 languages to serve as vertices in our graph
p80
aVTransliteration Links u'\u005cu2013' Natural flow brings words across languages with little morphological change
p81
aVEach language pair exhibits a Spearman sentiment correlation of at least 0.14, with an average correlation of 0.28 over all pairs
p82
aVIn particular, we pick 30 languages and compute sentiment scores for 2,000 distinct historical figures
p83
aVThe primary difference between is that label propagation takes multiple paths between two vertices into consideration, while graph propagation utilizes only the best path between word pairs
p84
aVWe experimented with both graph propagation algorithm [ 28 ] and label propagation algorithm [ 29 , 22 ]
p85
aVWe present the accuracy and coverage achieved by two propagation model in Table 1
p86
aVOur knowledge network is comprised of links from a heterogeneous collection of sources, of different coverage and reliability
p87
aVRespected artists like Steven Spielberg and Leonardo da Vinci show as consistently positive sentiment as notorious figures like Osama bin Laden and Adolf Hitler are negative
p88
aVWe review related work in Section 2
p89
aVDrawing a candidate lexicon from Wikipedia has some downsides (e.g., limited use of informal words), but is representative and convenient over a large number of languages
p90
aVWiktionary provides about 19.7% of the total links covering 382,754 vertices in our graph
p91
aVArabic
p92
aVTransliteration provides 22.1% of the total links in our experiment
p93
aVIn total we collect over 100,000 pairs of synonyms and antonyms and created 5.0% of the total links
p94
aVWiktionary u'\u005cu2013' This growing resource has entries for 171 languages, edited by people with sufficient background knowledge
p95
aVThe Polyglot project [ 3 ] identified the 100,000 most frequently used words in each language u'\u005cu2019' s Wikipedia
p96
aVFigure 1 illustrates how we encode links from different resources in an integer edge value
p97
aVNo doubt we missed some, but it is clear that these resources are not widely available for most important languages
