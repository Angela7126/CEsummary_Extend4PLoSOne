<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Lexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Computer assisted translation (CAT) subsumes several modes of interaction, ranging from binary feedback on the quality of the system prediction [ Saluja et al.2012 ] , to human post-editing operations on a system prediction resulting in a reference translation [ Cesa-Bianchi et al.2008 ] , to human acceptance or overriding of sentence completion predictions [ Langlais et al.2000 , Barrachina et al.2008 , Koehn</a>
