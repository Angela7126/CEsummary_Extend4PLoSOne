VAs a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e., very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the dispute / non-dispute label for the discussion as a whole
p1
aVWe evaluate the systems using standard F1 on classes of positive, negative, and neutral, where samples predicted as PP and P are positive alignment, and samples tagged as NN and N are negative alignment

aV1) Baseline (Polarity a sentence is predicted as positive if it has more positive words than negative words, or negative if more negative words are observed
p3
aVIf a sentence is only selected as positive by one annotator or obtains the label via turn-level annotation, it is positive (P
p4
aVVery negative (NN) and negative (N) are collected in the same way
