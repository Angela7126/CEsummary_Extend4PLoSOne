<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The coarse to fine pruning approach of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) employs an X-bar grammar as its first pruning phase, but there is no reason why we cannot begin with a more complex grammar for our initial pass</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Figure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u2019' s scores</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The resulting speed is 187.5 sentences per second, labeled in Table 1 as row labeled u'\u2018' Reimpl u'\u2019' with u'\u2018' Labeled, Coarse u'\u2019' pruning</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The result is a parsing speed of 185.5 sentences per second, as shown in Table 1 on the row labeled u'\u2018' Reimpl u'\u2019' with u'\u2018' Empty, Coarse u'\u2019' pruning</a>
