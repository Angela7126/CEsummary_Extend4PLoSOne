V[ 15 ] , the bigram embeddings are pre-trained on unlabeled data with character embeddings, which significantly improves the model performance
p1
aVIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation

aVPrevious work found that the performance can be improved by pre-training the character embeddings on large unlabeled data and using the obtained embeddings to initialize the character lookup table instead of random initialization [ 15 , 35 ]

aVAnother important result in Table 3 is that our neural network models perform much better than CRF-based model when only unigram features are used
