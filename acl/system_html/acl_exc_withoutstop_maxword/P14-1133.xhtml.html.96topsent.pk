VOnce the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model
p1
aVWe use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them
p2
aVwhere the parameters u'\u005cu0398' pr define the paraphrase model (Section 5 ), which is based on features extracted from text only (the input and canonical utterance
p3
aVWe define associations in x and c primarily by looking up phrase pairs in a phrase table constructed using the Paralex corpus [ 10 ]

aVIn conclusion, the main contribution of this paper is a novel approach for semantic parsing based on a simple generation procedure and
