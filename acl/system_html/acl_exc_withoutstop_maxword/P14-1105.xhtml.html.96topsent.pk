VBecause our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as u'\u005cu201c' neutral u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' biased u'\u005cu201d' , we filter the dataset further using dualist [ 23 ] , an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences in our dataset

aVIn this section we describe our initial dataset (Convote) and explain the procedure we followed for creating our new dataset ( ibc
p2
aVThere are over a million sentences in the ibc , most of which have no noticeable political bias
p3
aVTo train the dualist classifier, we manually assigned class labels of u'\u005cu201c' neutral u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' biased u'\u005cu201d' to 200
