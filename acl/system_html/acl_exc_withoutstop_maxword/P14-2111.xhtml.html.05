<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our string transduction model works by learning the sequence of edits which transform the input string into the output string</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Once trained the model is used to label new strings and the predicted edit script is applied to the input string producing the normalized output string</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The principal contributions of our work are i) we show that a discriminative sequence labeling model is apt for text normalization and performs at state-of-the-art levels with small amounts of labeled training data; (ii) we show that character-level neural text embeddings can be used to effectively incorporate information from unlabeled data into the model and can substantially boost text normalization performance</a>
