<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this case, the fact that the predicate indicates a report is not enough to determine the framing different sorts of reports carry radically different perceptions of factuality</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The search for reliable signals of information credibility in social media has led to the construction of automatic classifiers to identify credible tweets [ 2 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These features are used as predictors in a series of linear ridge regressions, where the dependent variable is the mean certainty rating</a>
