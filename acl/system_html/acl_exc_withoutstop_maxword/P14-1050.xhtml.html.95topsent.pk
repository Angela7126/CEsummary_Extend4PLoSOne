VFrom linguistic perspectives, new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns
p1
aVThis has linguistic interpretations because new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns
p2
aVAs can be seen from Table 4 , the association model (LRT) remarkably boosts the performance of new word detection, indicating LRT is a key factor for new sentiment word extraction
p3
aVThe second genre of the studies is to treat new word detection as a classification problem
p4
aVFrom linguistic perspectives, new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus can be extracted by lexical patterns
p5
aVIn [ 12 ] , new word detection was viewed as a binary classification problem
p6
aVIf a candidate word is a new word, it will be more commonly used with diversified lexical patterns since the non-compositionality of new word means that the word can be used in many different linguistic scenarios
