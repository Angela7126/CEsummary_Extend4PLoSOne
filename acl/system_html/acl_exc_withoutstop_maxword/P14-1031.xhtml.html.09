<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The second example in Table 5 shows that the PR model learned with discourse constraints correctly predicts the sentiment of two sentences where no lexical constraints apply</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can incorporate the proposed constraints (constraints derived from lexical patterns and discourse connectives) as hard constraints into CRF during inference by manually setting u'\u039b' in equation 4 to a large value, 9</a>
