<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We can calculate the entropy of the distribution as a value for SVM</a>
