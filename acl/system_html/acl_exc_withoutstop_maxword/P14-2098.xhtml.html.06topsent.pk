VWe combine Levenshtein algorithm with different merging algorithms for correction detection
p1
aVFirst, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced
p2
aV2) We have developed a merging model that reduces mis-detection by 1/3, leading to significant improvement in the accuracies of combined correction detection and error type selection
p3
aVTheir correction detection algorithm relies on a set of heuristics developed from one single data collection (the FCE corpus [ 17 ]
