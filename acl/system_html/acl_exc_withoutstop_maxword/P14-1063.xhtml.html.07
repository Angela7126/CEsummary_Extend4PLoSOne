<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u201c' design freedom u'\u201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Below, we reformulate the model from vector to tensor space</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This property makes the the tensor model very effective when training a large number of feature weights in a low-resource environment</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Properties of linear tensor model</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To apply a tensor model, we first need to convert the feature vector into a tensor u'\ud835' u'\udebd'</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This also makes training the model parameters a challenging problem, since the amount of labeled training data is usually small compared to the size of feature sets the feature weights cannot be estimated reliably</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Most traditional models are linear models, in the sense that both the features of the data and model parameters are represented as vectors in a vector space</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The size n d of each tensor mode, d = 1 , u'\u2026' , D , determines the structure of feature weights a tensor model can precisely represent, as well as the number of parameters</a>
