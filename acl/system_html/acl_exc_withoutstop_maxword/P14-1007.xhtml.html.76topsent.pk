VOur MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]
p1
aVThus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u005cu2018' paint u'\u005cu2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue
p2
aVScopal information in MRS analyses delivered by the ERG fixes the scope of operators u'\u005cu2014' such as negation, modals, scopal adverbs (including subordinating conjunctions like while ), and clause-embedding verbs (e.g., believe ) u'\u005cu2014' based on their position in the constituent structure, while leaving the scope of quantifiers (e.g., a or every , but also other determiners) free
p3
aVOur algorithm states that for this type of cue (a quantifier) the first step is functor crawling (see § 3.3 below), which brings \u005cspred _know_v_1 into the scope
p4
aVThe negation cue for a negated nominal argument will appear as a quantifier EP in the MRS, triggering line 3 of our algorithm
p5
aV\u005cciteA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat
p6
aVBy disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u005cu2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated
p7
aVThus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \u005cciteA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others
p8
aVSince in this case, the negation cue will not be a quantifier in the MRS, there will be no functor crawling to the verb u'\u005cu2019' s EP
p9
aVThus, the deep parsing front-end system to our MRS Crawler has
p10
