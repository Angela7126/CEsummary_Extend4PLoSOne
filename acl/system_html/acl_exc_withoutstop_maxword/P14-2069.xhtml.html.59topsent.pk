VWe descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output
p1
aVFor each emotion category, we evaluates it as a binary classification problem
p2
aVThe proposed EaLDA model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] model by employing a small set of seeds to guide the model generating topics
p3
aVUsually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification
p4
aVIn the evaluation of emotion lexicons, the binary classification is performed in a very simple way
p5
aVLastly, previous emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on many manually constructed resources (e.g.,, emotion lexicon, parsers, etc
p6
aVOur approach is a weakly supervised approach since only some seeds emotion sentiment words are needed to lanch the process of lexicon construction
p7
aVThese domain-specific words are mostly not included in any other existing general-purpose emotion lexicons
p8
aVThe experimental results show
