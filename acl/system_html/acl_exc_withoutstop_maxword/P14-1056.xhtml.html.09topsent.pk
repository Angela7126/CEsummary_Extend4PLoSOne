(lp0
VFor example, when booktitle segments co-occur with number segments but not with journal segments, the second constraint is violated
p1
aVSome examples of constraints in this form enforce that journal segments should co-occur with pages segments and that booktitle segments should co-occur with address segments
p2
aVThe two hierarchical constraints with the highest importance scores with non-zero learned penalties constrain the output such that number of person segments does not exceed the number of first segments and vice-versa
p3
aVTake, for example, the constraint that the number of number segments does not exceed the number of booktitle segments, as well as the constraint that it does not exceed the number of journal segments
p4
aVOne important pairwise constraint penalizes outputs in which thesis segments don u'\u005cu2019' t co-occur with school segments
p5
aVMAP inference in the model with soft constraints is performed using Soft-DD, shown in Algorithm 3
p6
aVFor 11.99% of the examples, the Soft-DD algorithm satisfies constraints that were not satisfied during unconstrained inference, while in the remaining 11.72% Soft-DD converges with some constraints left unsatisfied, which is possible since we are imposing them as soft constraints
p7
aVHowever, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints
p8
aVSince we truncate penalties at 0, this suggests that we will learn a penalty of 0 for constraints in three categories constraints
