VAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p1
aVFollowing this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing states and words for each tag sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' as a latent tree graphical model, which encodes conditional independences among the words given the latent states
p2
aVHowever, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more complicated than in observed models
p3
aVThis undirected tree is converted into a directed tree by applying h dir
p4
aVThis means our decoder first identifies (given a POS sequence) an undirected tree, and then
