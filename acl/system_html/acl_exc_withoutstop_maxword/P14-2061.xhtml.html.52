<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions in the lexicon these too make sign languages across the world very similar in appearance, even though the meaning of specific articulations may differ [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To avoid this problem, we removed the background by using background subtraction techniques and manually selected thresholds</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The second reason for data preprocessing is to make the input size smaller and uniform</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There is evidence that normalization and whitening [ 13 ] improve performance in unsupervised feature learning [ 4 ]</a>
