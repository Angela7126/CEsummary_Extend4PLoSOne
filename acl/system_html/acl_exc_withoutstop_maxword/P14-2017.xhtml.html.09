<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We employ several orthographic metrics widely used in this research area the edit distance [ 22 ] , the longest common subsequence ratio [ 24 ] and the XDice metric [ 3 ] 4 4 We use normalized similarity metrics</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a method for automatic detection of cognate pairs using orthographic alignment</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, we use SpSim [ 11 ] , which outperformed the longest common subsequence ratio and a similarity measure based on the edit distance in previous experiments</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In order to detect the best threshold for discriminating between cognates and non-cognates, we run a decision stump classifier (provided by Weka) on the training set for each pair of languages and for each metric</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In order to maintain a stratified dataset, we discard an equal number of non-cognates in the training set and then we compute the distances for the rest of the training set and for the test set</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These results support the relevance of accounting</a>
