<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For the semantic reordering model, it takes a PAS and models its reordering on the target side</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For models with syntactic reordering, we add two new features (i.e.,, one for the leftmost reordering model and the other for the rightmost reordering model) into the log-linear translation model in Eq</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Table 1 shows the features used in syntactic leftmost and rightmost reordering models</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The non-syntax-based reordering approach models the reordering of translation words/phrases while the syntax-based approach models the reordering of syntactic constituents</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models, and the gain achieved by the semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the MR08 syntactic features</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As mentioned earlier, the linguistic reordering unit is the syntactic constituent for syntactic reordering, and the semantic role for semantic reordering</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To show the effectiveness of our reordering models, we integrate both syntactic constituent reordering models and semantic role reordering models into a state-of-the-art HPB system [ 4 , 7 ]</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers,</a>
