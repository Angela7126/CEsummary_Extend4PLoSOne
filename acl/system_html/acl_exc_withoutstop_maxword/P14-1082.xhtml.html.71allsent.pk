VWe see that the language model baseline for English u'\u005cu2192' French shows the same substantial improvement over the baseline as our English u'\u005cu2192' Spanish results
p1
aVIn other words, for each word type or phrase type that occurs as a fragment in the training set, and which does not map to just a single translation, a classifier is trained
p2
aVThird, we observe that adding the language model to our classifier leads to another significant gain (configuration l1r1 + LM in the results in Table 2
p3
aVThe main research question in this research is how to disambiguate an L1 word or phrase to its L2 translation based on an L2 context, and whether such cross-lingual contextual approaches provide added value compared to baseline models that are not context informed or compared to standard language models
p4
aVThe language model is a trigram-based back-off language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, computed using SRILM [] and trained on the same training data as the translation model
p5
aVWords or phrases that always map to a single translation are stored in a simple mapping table, as a classifier would have no added value in such cases
p6
aVA second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier
p7
aVThis intuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem to be better than any other when uniformly applied to all classifier experts, but it may well be that certain classifiers benefit from different feature selections
p8
aVPer classifier expert, the best scoring configuration was selected, referred to as the auto configuration in Table 2
p9
aVWhen presented with test data, in which the L1 fragment is explicitly marked, we first check whether there is ambiguity for this L1 fragment and if a direct translation is available in our simple mapping table
p10
aVIf not, we check for the presence of a classifier expert for the offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by extracting the desired number of L2 local context words to the immediate left and right of this fragment and adding those to the feature vector
p11
aVNumerous classifiers are trained and each is an expert in translating a single word or phrase
p12
aVAs expected, the LM baseline substantially outperforms the context-insensitive MLF baseline
p13
aVOur full system, including the scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation, is implemented in Python and freely available as open-source from http://github.com/proycon/colibrita/
p14
aVPreparing the data to build training and test data for our intended translation assistance system is not trivial, as the type of interactive translation assistant we aim to develop does not exist yet
p15
aVThe baseline selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2 fragment according to the phrase-translation table
p16
aVHowever, if we enable the language model as we do in the auto + LM configuration we do not notice an improvement over l1r1 + LM , surprisingly
p17
aVWe therefore conducted a number of experiments with other language pairs, and present the abridged results in Table 6
p18
aVIn order to draw accurate conclusions, experiments on a single data set and language pair are not sufficient
p19
aVThe auto configuration improves results over the uniformly applied feature selection
p20
aVAutomatic configuration selection was done by performing leave-one-out testing (for small number of instances) or 10-fold-cross validation (for larger number of instances, n u'\u005cu2265' 20 ) on the training data per classifier expert
p21
aVAn ideal test corpus would consist of L2 sentences with L1 fallback as crafted by L2 language learners with an L1 background
p22
aVIf output o is a subset of reference r then a score of o r is assigned for that sentence pair
p23
aVThe word accuracy for the entire set is then computed by taking the sum of the word accuracies per sentence pair, divided by the total number of sentence pairs
p24
aVAmong the classifier experts are only words and phrases that are ambiguous and may thus map to multiple translations
p25
aVThe fact that a phrase-translation table needs to be constructed for the test data is also the reason that the parallel corpus split from which the test data is derived has to be large enough, ensuring better quality
p26
aVThe classifiers use the IB1 algorithm [] as implemented in TiMBL []
p27
aVWe do so by normalising the class probability from the classifier ( s u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e T u'\u005cu2062' ( H ) ), which is our translation model, and the language model ( s u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e l u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( H ) ), in such a way that the highest classifier score for the alternatives under consideration is always 1.0 , and the highest language model score of the sentence is always 1.0
p28
aVThis baseline, henceforth referred to as the u'\u005cu2019' most likely fragment u'\u005cu2019' baseline (MLF) is analogous to the u'\u005cu2019' most frequent sense u'\u005cu2019' -baseline common in evaluating WSD systems
p29
aVThis ensures complete independence of training and test data
p30
aVThe choice for this algorithm is motivated by the fact that it handles multiple classes with ease, but first and foremost because it has been successfully employed for word sense disambiguation in other studies [] , in particular in cross-lingual word sense disambiguation, a task closely resembling our current task []
p31
aVStep 4 is effectively a filter two thresholds can be configured to discard weak alignments, i.e., those with low probabilities, from the phrase-translation table so that only strong couplings make it into the generated set
p32
aVWe first measure absolute accuracy by simply counting all output fragments that exactly match the reference fragments, as a fraction of the total amount of fragments
p33
aVA context size of one prevails in the vast majority of cases, which is not surprising considering the good results we have already seen with this configuration
p34
aVThe error rate metrics show improvement as well
p35
aVThis number is much larger than the 200 , 000 we mentioned before because single sentence pairs may be reused multiple times with different marked fragments
p36
aVThis implies that such words and phrases must have occurred at least twice in the corpus, though this threshold is made configurable and could have been set higher to limit the number of classifiers
p37
aVThis measure may be too strict, so we add a more flexible word accuracy measure which takes into account partial matches at the word level
p38
aVNevertheless, it has to be noted that even with u'\u005cu039b' 1 and u'\u005cu039b' 2 , the test set will include a certain amount of errors
p39
aVOutput a pair ( s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' e t u'\u005cu2032' , s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' e t ) where s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' e t u'\u005cu2032' is a copy of t but with fragment f t substituted by f s , i.e., the introduction of an L1 word or phrase in an L2 sentence
p40
aVA second parameter u'\u005cu039b' 2 further limits the considered phrase pairs ( f s , f t ) to have the product of their conditional probabilities not not deviate more than a fraction u'\u005cu039b' 2 from the joint probability for the strongest possible pairing for f s , the source fragment f s u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' t in Figure 1 corresponds to the best scoring translation for a given source fragment f s
p41
aVIn all of our experiments recall is high (well above 90 u'\u005cu2062' % ), mostly because train and test data lie in the same domain and have been generated in the same fashion, lower recall is expected with more real-world data
p42
aVIn all of the aforementioned experiments, the system produced a single solution for each of the fragments, the one it deemed best, or no solution at all if it could not find any
p43
aVConclusions with regard to context width may have to be tempered somewhat, as the performance of the l1r1 configuration was found to not be significantly better than that of the l2r2 configuration
p44
aVThis is due to the nature of the unsupervised method with which the phrase-translation table is constructed
p45
aVThe same holds for the Chinese u'\u005cu2192' English experiment
p46
aV1 1 http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl IB1 implements k -nearest neighbour classification
p47
aVIn earlier work , we reported a decrease in performance due to overfitting when this is done, so we do not expect it to make a positive impact
p48
aVIt invokes GIZA++ [] to establish statistical word alignments based on the IBM Models and subsequently extracts phrases using the grow-diag-final algorithm []
p49
aVNo additional external data was brought in, to keep the comparison fair
p50
aVWe therefore attach low importance to this deviation in BLEU here
p51
aVIf instead, r is a subset of o , then a score of r o will be assigned
p52
aVMLF baseline
p53
aVMLF baseline
p54
aVMLF baseline
p55
aVMLF baseline
p56
aVThe experiments however showed that inclusion of such keywords did not make any noticeable impact on any of the results, so we restrict ourselves to mentioning this negative result
p57
aVWe therefore proceed with this line of investigation as well
p58
aVIf so, we are done quickly and need not rely on context information
p59
aVHowever, such corpora do not exist as yet
p60
aVThis metric thus effectively prunes weaker alternative translations in the phrase-translation table from being considered if there is a much stronger candidate
p61
aVVersion tag v0.2.1 is representative for the version used in this research
p62
aVThe idea of local phrase selection with a discriminative machine learning classifier using additional local (source-language) context was introduced in parallel to Stroppa et al
p63
aVIt adds a LM component to the MLF baseline
p64
aVThe parameter u'\u005cu039b' 1 adds a constraint based on the product of the two conditional probabilities ( P ( f t f s ) u'\u005cu22c5' P ( f s f t ) ) , and sets a threshold that has to be surpassed
p65
aVThough the classifier generally works best in the l1r1 configuration, i.e., with context size one, the trigram-based language model allows further left-context information to be incorporated that influences the weights of the classifier output, successfully forcing the system to select alternatives
p66
aVThe classifier maps the L1 word or phrase in its L2 context to its L2 translation
p67
aVWhereas machine translation generally concerns the translation of whole sentences or texts from one language to the other, this study focusses on the translation of native language (henceforth L1) words and phrases, i.e., smaller fragments, in a foreign language (L2) context
p68
aVLikewise, Table 4 exemplifies small fragments from the l1r1 configuration compared to the same configuration enriched with a language model
p69
aVThe auto configuration does not uniformly apply the same feature vector setup to all classifier experts but instead seeks to find the optimal setup per classifier expert
p70
aVThe feature vector for the classifiers represents a local context of neighbouring words, and optionally also global context keywords in a binary-valued bag-of-words configuration
p71
aVSecond, our classifier approach attains a substantially higher accuracy than the LM baseline
p72
aVWhilst other thresholds may possibly produce cleaner sets, this is hard to evaluate as finding optimal values causes a prohibitive increase in complexity of the search space, and again this is not necessary to test our hypothesis
p73
aVThe eleven largest classifiers are shown in Table 1 , along with the number of training instances per classifier
p74
aVTable 2 shows the results for English to Spanish in more detail and adds a comparison with the two baseline systems
p75
aVIt has also been used in machine translation studies in which local source context is used to classify source phrases into target phrases, rather than looking them up in a phrase table []
p76
aVThis combination of a classifier with context size one and trigram-based language model proves to be most effective and reaches the best results so far
p77
aVThe same significance level was found when comparing l1r1 + LM against l1r1 , auto + LM against auto , as well as the LM baseline against the MLF baseline
p78
aVThis LM baseline allows the comparison of classification through L1 fragments in an L2 context, with a more traditional L2 context modelling (i.e., target language modelling) which is also customary in MT decoders
p79
aVFrom this training set of sentence pairs over 100 , 000 classifier experts are derived
p80
aVHowever, for English u'\u005cu2192' Dutch and English u'\u005cu2192' Chinese we find that the LM baseline actually performs slightly worse than baseline
p81
aVThe first experiment, of which the results are shown in Figure 2 , sets a fixed and symmetric local context size across all classifiers, and tests three context widths
p82
aVThe actual Europarl training set we generate for English (L1) to Spanish (L2), i.e., English fallback in a Spanish context, consists of 5 , 608 , 015 sentence pairs
p83
aVIn the current study we simply left both weights set to one, thereby assigning equal importance to translation model and language model
p84
aVA context-insensitive yet informed baseline was constructed to assess the impact of L2 context information in translating L1 fragments
p85
aVFor any given hypothesis H , results from the L1 to L2 classifier are combined with results from the L2 language model
p86
aVThe various lXrY configurations use the same feature vector setup for all classifier experts
p87
aVWe observe in this data that the language model often has the added power to choose a correct translation that is not the first prediction of the classifier, but one of the weaker alternatives that nevertheless fits better
p88
aVWe also implement a statistical language model as an optional component of our classifier-based system and also as a baseline to compare our system to
p89
aVWe develop a classifier-based system composed of so-called u'\u005cu201c' classifier experts u'\u005cu201d'
p90
aVIt appears that the classifier approach and the L2 language model are able to complement each other
p91
aVGenerating test data using the same phrase-translation table as the training data would introduce a bias
p92
aVNevertheless, in all these cases, the positive effect of including a Language Model to our classifier-based system again shows
p93
aVThe local context consists of an X number of L2 words to the left of the L1 fragment, and Y words to the right
p94
aVWe suspect the lack of impact here can be explained by the trigram-based Language Model having less added value when the (left) context size of the classifier is two or three; they are now less complementary
p95
aVIt has been argued that classifier experts in a word sense disambiguation ensemble should be individually optimised []
p96
aVTable 5 lists what context sizes have been chosen in the automatic feature selection
p97
aVWe experimented with several asymmetric configurations and found that taking two words to the left and one to the right yields even better results than symmetric configurations for this data set
p98
aVThis shall be further discussed in Section 6.1
p99
aVHere X indicates the left context size and Y the right context size
p100
aVThe classifier will return a probability distribution of the most likely translations given the context and we can replace the L1 fragment with the highest scoring L2 translation and present it back to the user
p101
aVCurrently, language learners need to refer to a bilingual dictionary when in doubt about a translation of a word or phrase
p102
aVThe final test sets are a randomly sampled 5 , 000 sentence pairs from the 200 , 000 -sentence test split for each language pair
p103
aVFor the classifier-based system, we tested various different feature vector configurations
p104
aVIn addition to local context features, we also experimented with global context features
p105
aVAnother discrepancy is found in the BLEU scores of the English u'\u005cu2192' Chinese experiments, where we measure an unexpected drop in BLEU score under baseline
p106
aVThe final test set is created by randomly sampling the desired number of test instances
p107
aVThe latter study on cross-lingual WSD finds a positive impact when conducting feature selection per classifier
p108
aVIn Table 3 we present some illustrative examples from the English u'\u005cu2192' Spanish Europarl data
p109
aVIn our discourse, the source language ( s ) corresponds to L1, the fallback language used for by the end-user for inserting fragments, whilst the target language ( t ) is L2
p110
aVThere are some noticeable discrepancies for some experiments in Table 6 when compared to our earlier results in Table 2
p111
aVSeveral automated metrics exist for the evaluation of L2 system output against the L2 reference output in the test set
p112
aVThe result, independent for each set, will be a phrase-translation table ( T ) that maps phrases in L1 to L2
p113
aVNote that the training set and test set are constructed on their own respective and independently generated phrase-translation tables
p114
aVThe data for our experiments were drawn from the Europarl parallel corpus [] from which we extracted two sets of 200 , 000 sentence pairs each for several language pairs
p115
aVWe need to generate training and test data that realistically emulates the task
p116
aVGiven these phrase-translation tables, we can now extract both training data and test data using the algorithm in Figure 1
p117
aVWe also compute a recall metric that measures the number of fragments that the system provided a translation for as a fraction of the total number of fragments in the input, regardless of whether the fragment is translated correctly or not
p118
aVIn addition to these, the system u'\u005cu2019' s output can be compared against the L2 reference translation(s) using established Machine Translation evaluation metrics
p119
aVHere we observe that a context width of one yields the best results
p120
aVThis is done using the scripts provided by the Statistical Machine Translation system Moses []
p121

p123
aVWe show the difference between the most-likely-fragment baseline and our system
p124
aVNevertheless, we hope to show that our automated way of test set generation is sufficient to test the feasibility of our core hypothesis that L1 fragments can be translated to L2 using L2 context information
p125
aVIf desired, the search can be parametrised with variables u'\u005cu039b' 3 and u'\u005cu039b' 4 , representing the weights we want to attach to the classifier-based translation model and the language model, respectively
p126
aVThe BLEU scores, not included in the figure but shown in Table 2 , show a similar trend
p127
aVHaque et al
p128
aVYet, this problem arises in a context, not in isolation; the learner may have already translated successfully a part of the text into L2 leading up to the problematic word or phrase
p129
aVWe have not conducted experiments with language models of other orders
p130
aVAlthough there is a morpho-syntactic component in this research, our scope is more constrained; its focus is on the faithful preservation of meaning from L1 to L2, akin to the role of the translation model in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT
p131
aVThe parts in bold correspond to respectively the inserted fragment and the system translation
p132
aVAlternative evaluation metrics could allow the system to output multiple alternatives
p133
aVThe full table would reveal a Zipfian distribution
p134
aVFor our purposes however, the test set suffices to test our hypothesis
p135
aVOne is the basis for the training set, and the other is the basis for the test set

p137
aVThe cross-lingual context in our research question may at first seem artificial, but its design explicitly aims at applications related to computer-aided language learning [] and computer-aided translation []
p138
aVThis result is in line with the positive effect of adding the LM to the l1r1
p139
aVusing phrase-translation table T and parallel corpus split S
p140
aVComputing this baseline is done in the same fashion as previously illustrated in Equation 1 , where s u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e T then represents the normalised p ( t s ) score from the phrase-translation table rather than the class probability from the classifier
p141
aVThe bottom lines in Table 2 represent results when all right-context is omitted, emulating a real-time prediction when no right context is available yet
p142
aVDictionaries are not the best source to look up context; they may contain example usages, but remain biased towards single words or short expressions
p143
aVThe keywords are selected to be indicative for a specific translation
p144
aVLet us first zoom in to convey a sense of scale on a specific language pair
p145
aVIn this research we test the feasibility of the foundation of this idea.The following examples serve to illustrate the idea and demonstrate what output the proposed translation assistance system would ideally produce
p146
aVThese were used to form the training and test sets
p147
aVAlso, we note that in all cases our system performs better than the two baselines
p148
aVAutomatic feature selection auto was found to perform statistically better than l1r1 , but only at p 0.05
p149
aVWe used the method of extraction by and encoded all keywords in a binary bag of words model

aVStatistical significance on the BLEU scores was tested using pairwise bootstrap sampling []
