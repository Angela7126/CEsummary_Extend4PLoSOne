<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Note that the Asiya metrics are combinations of several metrics, and these combinations (which exclude DR and DR- lex ) can be also tuned; this yields sizable improvements over the untuned versions as column three in the table shows</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Asiya- lex</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Group I contains our evaluation metrics, DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Adding DR and DR- lex to the combinations manages to improve over five and four of the six tuned Asiya metrics, respectively</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Furthermore, we also present overall results for i ) the average score over all metrics, excluding DR and DR- lex , and ( ii ) the differences in the correlations for the DR/DR- lex -combined and the original metrics</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For each metric in groups II, III and IV, we present the results for the original metric as well for the linear interpolation of that metric with DR and with DR- lex</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The uniform linear combination of the previous 7 individual metrics plus the 12 from Asiya- 0809 is reported as Asiya- all in the experimental section</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Group II includes the metrics that participated in the WMT12 metrics task, excluding metrics which did not have results for all language pairs</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Compared to this baseline, DR improves for three of the six Asiya metrics, while DR- lex improves for four of them</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Again, DR- lex is</a>
