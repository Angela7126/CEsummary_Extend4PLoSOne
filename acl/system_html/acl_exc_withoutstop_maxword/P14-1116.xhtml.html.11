<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Content selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in a summary</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Content is regarded as labels (each template represents a label) and thus the task can be thought of as a classification problem</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Here, we propose an alternative method that tackles the challenge of interdependent data by using multi-label (ML) classification, which is efficient in taking data dependencies into account and generating a set of labels (in our case templates) simultaneously []</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For the corpus creation, 11 lecturers selected the content to be conveyed in a summary, given the set of raw data []</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our contributions to the field are as follows we present a novel and efficient method for tackling the challenge of content selection using a ML classification approach; we applied this method to the domain of feedback summarisation; we present a comparison with an optimisation technique (Reinforcement Learning), and we discuss the similarities and differences between the two methods</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>RAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The decisions of factor selection can be influenced by other factors that their values are correlated with; can be based on the appearance or absence of other factors in the summary; and can be based on the factors u'\u2019' behaviour over time</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Ensemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods</a>
