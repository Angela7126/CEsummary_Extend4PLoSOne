<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A major difference of RNTN from the conventional recursive neural network (RRN) [] is the use of the tensor V in order to directly capture the multiplicative interaction of two input vectors, although the matrix W implicitly captures the nonlinear interaction between the input vectors</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that depending on different purposes, p 1 s u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' n can take the value of the automatically predicted sentiment distribution obtained in forward propagation, the gold sentiment annotation of node p 1 , or even other normalized prior sentiment value or confidence score from external sources (e.g.,, sentiment lexicons or external training data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Much recent work considers sentiment analysis from a semantic-composition perspective [] , which achieved the state-of-the-art performance used a collection of hand-written compositional rules to assign sentiment values to different granularities of text spans proposed a learning-based framework</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The approach leverages a principled method, the forward and backward propagation, to learn a vector representation to optimize the system performance</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Evaluation metrics We use the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the models, which measures the averaged absolute offsets between the predicted sentiment values and the gold</a>
