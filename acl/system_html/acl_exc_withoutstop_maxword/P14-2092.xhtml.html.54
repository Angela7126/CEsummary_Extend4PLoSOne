<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u2062' ( u'\u22c5' ) is used to assign a model score to each derivation</a>
