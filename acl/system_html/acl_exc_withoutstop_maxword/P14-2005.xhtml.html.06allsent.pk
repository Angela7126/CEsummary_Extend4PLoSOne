VIn particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e.,, links among mentions within entities) and response coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e.,, links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account
p1
aVThis is the case where the key and response side has only entities consisting of singleton mentions
p2
aVKey entity is { a } ; response entity is { b }
p3
aVThis is the case where all mentions in the key and response are in one entity
p4
aVHowever, when response mentions are not identical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) cannot be applied directly to systems with imperfect mentions
p5
aVFor instance, if the key entities are { a,b,c } { d,e }; and the response entities are { b,c } { e,f,g }, then the key coreference link (a,b) is not seen on the response side; similarly, it is possible that a response link does not appear on the key side either c,f) and (f,g) are not in the key in the above example
p6
aVCoreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to
p7
aVThis is boundary case (2 there are no coreference links
p8
aVFor example, R c is the ratio of the number of correct coreference links over the number of key coreference links; P c is the ratio of the number of correct coreference links over the number of response coreference links, and so on
p9
aVBLANC = 0
p10
aVTo account for missing or spurious links, we observe that x u'\u005cu2219' C k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' N k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key non-coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' C r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response coreference links missing in the key; x u'\u005cu2219' N r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response non-coreference links missing in the key, and we propose to extend the coreference F-measure and non-coreference F-measure as follows
p11
aVBLANC [ 7 ] , on the other hand, considers both coreference links and non-coreference links
p12
aVThe BLANC-gold metric was developed with the assumption that response mentions and key mentions are identical
p13
aVIn fact, the proposed BLANC metric subsumes the original one in that its value is identical to the original one when response mentions are identical to key mentions
p14
aVSince there is no non-coreference link, BLANC reduces to the coreference F-measure F c
p15
aVSince there is no coreference link, BLANC reduces to the non-coreference F-measure F n
p16
aVSo the final definition of BLANC can be succinctly stated as
p17
aVWe use key to refer to gold standard mentions or entities, and response to refer to system mentions or entities
p18
aVUsing the notations in Section 2 , the recall, precision, and F-measure on coreference links are
p19
aVIt calculates recall, precision and F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and defines the overall recall, precision and F-measure as the mean of the respective measures for coreference and non-coreference links
p20
aVB-cubed and CEAF treat entities as sets of mentions and measure the agreement between key (or gold standard) entities and response (or system-generated) entities, while MUC and BLANC-gold are link-based
p21
aVR is the set of response entities, and r j is the j t u'\u005cu2062' h response entity
p22
aVUnder the assumption that the key and response mention sets are identical (which implies that T k = T r ), Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) make sense
p23
aVThis is boundary case (3 there are no non-coreference links
p24
aVNon-coreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to
p25
aVThis is boundary case (1
p26
aVKey entity is { a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' c } ; response entity is { b u'\u005cu2062' c }
p27
aVSimilarly, the recall, precision, and F-measure on non-coreference links are computed as
p28
aVNote that when an entity consists of a single mention, its coreference link set is empty
p29
aVWe observe that the definition of the proposed BLANC, Equ. ( 9 )-( 14 ) subsume the BLANC-gold ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) due to the following proposition
p30
aVM k and M r are the key and response mention set
p31
aVWe say that a key link l 1 u'\u005cu2208' T k equals a response link l 2 u'\u005cu2208' T r if and only if the pair of mentions from which the links are formed are identical
p32
aVIn reality, however, mentions need to be detected from natural language text and the result is, more often than not, imperfect some key mentions may be missing in the response, and some response mentions may be spurious u'\u005cu2014' so-called u'\u005cu201c' twinless u'\u005cu201d' mentions by Stoyanov et al
p33
aVWe first briefly review the original definition of BLANC, and rewrite its definition using set notation
p34
aV0 , then BLANC = F c
p35
aVCare has to be taken when counts of the BLANC definition are 0
p36
aV0 , then BLANC = F n
p37
aVThe proposed BLANC continues to be the arithmetic average of F c and F n
p38
aVSo we only need to augment the BLANC definition for the following cases
p39
aVSo BLANC = F n = 1 3
p40
aVFinally, BLANC = 17 35
p41
aVNote that the non-coreference link set is empty when all mentions are in the same entity
p42
aVFigure 1 shows how the proposed BLANC measure works when compared with existing metrics such as MUC, B-cubed and CEAF, using the BLANC and F1 scores
p43
aVKey entities are { a } u'\u005cu2062' { b } u'\u005cu2062' { c } ; response entities are { a } u'\u005cu2062' { b } u'\u005cu2062' { d }
p44
aVRand Index is defined as the ratio between the number of correct within-cluster links plus the number of correct cross-cluster links, and the total number of links
p45
aVIt is easy to see that the gold mention assumption u'\u005cu2014' same set of response mentions as the set of key mentions u'\u005cu2014' can be equivalently stated as T k = T r (this does not necessarily mean that C k = C r or N k = N r
p46
aVWe have updated the publicly available CoNLL coreference scorer 1 1 http://code.google.com/p/reference-coreference-scorers with the proposed BLANC, and used it to compute the proposed BLANC scores for all the CoNLL 2011 [ 5 ] and 2012 [ 4 ] participants in the official track, where participants had to automatically predict the mentions
p47
aVWe use T k = C k u'\u005cu222a' N k and T r = C r u'\u005cu222a' N r to denote the total set of key links and total set of response links, respectively
p48
aVWhen T k = T r , Rand Index can be applied directly since coreference resolution reduces to a clustering problem where mentions are partitioned into clusters (entities
p49
aVCoreference resolution aims at identifying natural language expressions (or mentions) that refer to the same entity
p50
aVThe goal of this paper is to extend the BLANC-gold metric to imperfect response mentions
p51
aVWe walk through a few examples and show how BLANC is calculated in detail
p52
aVKey entities are { a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' c } and { d } ; response entities are { b u'\u005cu2062' c } and { d u'\u005cu2062' e }
p53
aVProof
p54
aVIn all the examples below, each lower-case letter represents a mention; mentions in an entity are closed in {}; two letters in () represent a link
p55
aVThe proposed BLANC is highly positively correlated with the other measures along R, P and F1 (Table 3 ), showing that BLANC is able to capture most entity-based similarities measured by B-cubed and CEAF
p56
aVIn practice, though, the simple-minded adoption of Rand Index is not satisfactory since the number of non-coreference links often overwhelms that of coreference links [ 7 ] , or
p57
aVHowever, the CoNLL data sets come from OntoNotes [ 2 ] , where singleton entities are not annotated, and BLANC has a wider dynamic range on data sets with singletons [ 7 ]
p58
aVThis leads to a phenomenon where coreference systems outputting large entities are scored more favorably than those outputting small entities [ 3 ]
p59
aVBLANC-gold solves this problem by averaging the F-measure computed over coreference links and the F-measure over non-coreference links
p60
aVLet C k u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) and C r u'\u005cu2062' ( j ) be the set of coreference links formed by mentions in k i and r j
p61
aVThe collection of key entities is denoted by K = { k i } i = 1
p62
aVThis can happen when all key (or response) mentions are in one cluster or are all singletons the former case will lead to N k = u'\u005cu2205' (or N r = u'\u005cu2205' ); the latter will lead to C k = u'\u005cu2205' (or C r = u'\u005cu2205'
p63
aVSuperscript g in these equations highlights the fact that they are meant for coreference systems with gold mentions
p64
aVWe prove the first one (the other proofs are similar and elided due to space limitations
p65
aVRand Index, if used without modification, would not be sensitive to changes of coreference links
p66
aVThe proposed BLANC is applied to the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 shared task participants, and the scores and its correlations with existing metrics are shown in Section 5
p67
aVEqn. ( 8 ) indicates that BLANC-gold assigns equal weight to F c ( g ) , the F-measure from coreference links, and F n ( g ) , the F-measure from non-coreference links
p68
aVTherefore, the identical-mention-set assumption limits BLANC-gold u'\u005cu2019' s applicability when gold mentions are not available, or when one wants to have a single score measuring both the quality of mention detection and coreference resolution
p69
aVUnification for other component recalls and precisions can be done similarly
p70
aVLet N k u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) ( i u'\u005cu2260' j ) be key non-coreference links formed between mentions in k i and those in k j , and let N r u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) ( i u'\u005cu2260' j ) be response non-coreference links formed between mentions in r i and those in r j , respectively
p71
aVK where k i is the i t u'\u005cu2062' h key entity; accordingly, R = { r j } j = 1
p72
aVAs can be seen, a link is an undirected edge between two mentions, and it can be equivalently represented by a pair of mentions
p73
aVObserve that as long as
p74
aVSo the correlations will likely be lower on data sets with singleton entities
p75
aVA critically important problem is how to measure the quality of a coreference resolution system
p76
aVThis can happen when a document has no more than one mention and there is no link
p77
aVWe assume that mentions in { k i } and { r j } are unique; in other words, there is no duplicate mention
p78
aVIt entails partitioning (often imperfect) mentions into equivalence classes
p79
aVIndeed, since C k is a union of three disjoint subsets
p80
aVWe then argue that the gold-mention assumption in Recasens and Hovy ( 2011 ) can be lifted without changing the original definition
p81
aVThis paves the way to generalize it to imperfect system mentions, which is presented in Section 4
p82
aV1) If C k = C r = u'\u005cu2205' and N k = N r = u'\u005cu2205' , then BLANC = I ( M k = M r ) , where I u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is an indicator function whose value is 1 if its argument is true, and 0 otherwise
p83
aVFinally, the BLANC-gold metric is the arithmetic average of F c ( g ) and F n ( g )
p84
aVWe write l 1 = l 2 if two links are equal
p85
aVWe use the same letter and subscription without the index in parentheses to denote the union of sets, e.g
p86
aVThis establishes that R c = R c ( g )
p87
aVMany evaluation metrics have been proposed in the past two decades, including the MUC measure [ 9 ] , B-cubed [ 1 ] , CEAF [ 3 ] and, more recently, BLANC-gold [ 7 ]
p88
aV0 , F c in ( 18 ) is well-defined; as long as
p89
aVSince C k = { ( a u'\u005cu2062' b ) , ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) , ( c u'\u005cu2062' a ) } , and C r = { ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) } , we have C k u'\u005cu2229' C r = { ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) } , and R c = 1 3 , P c = 1 , So BLANC = F c = 2 4 = 1 2
p90
aVWe then present the original BLANC-gold in Section 3 using the set notation defined in Section 2
p91
aVIn Eqn. ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) and Eqn. ( 5 ) - ( 6 ), denominators are written as a sum of disjoint subsets so they can be related to the contingency table in [ 7 ]
p92
aVC r should the original Rand Index be used
p93
aVBLANC-gold is adapted from Rand Index [ 6 ] , a metric for clustering objects
p94
aVWe also use u'\u005cu22c5' to denote the size of a set
p95
aVWe introduce the notions used in this paper in Section 2
p96
aVThis avoids the problem that
p97
aVThe rest of the paper is organized as follows

aVLikewise, C r and N r form a partition of T r

aVWe would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable suggestions for improving the paper

aVClearly, C k and N k form a partition of T k since C k u'\u005cu2229' N k = u'\u005cu2205' , T k = C k u'\u005cu222a' N k
