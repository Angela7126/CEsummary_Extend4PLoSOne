VNext, three spelling correction methods were tested noisy channel, iterative correction and our method (stochastic iterative correction
p1
aVWe experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers
p2
aVOn the u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d' dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1
p3
aVNoisy channel and iterative methods u'\u005cu2019' frontiers are considerably inferior to the proposed method on u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d' dataset, which means that our method works better
p4
aVAs any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word
p5
aVIn this paper, we improved effectiveness of the noisy channel for the correction of complex errors
p6
aVA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be
