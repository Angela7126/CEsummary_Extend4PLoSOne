<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to Shneiderman and Plaisant [ 18 ] , query-by-example has largely fallen out of favor as a user interface design approach</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A downside of QBE is that the user must manipulate an example to arrive at the desired generalization</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The user can either click on the tree or modify the LISP expression to generalize the query</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For instance, the Linguist u'\u2019' s Search Engine [ 17 ] uses a query-by-example strategy in which a user types in an initial sentence in English, and the system produces a graphical view of a parse tree as output, which the user can alter</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One current presentation (not used with auto-suggest) is to name the relation and show blanks where the words that satisfy it would appear as in X is the subject of Y [ 14 ] ; we used this as the baseline presentation in our experiments because it employs the relation definitions found in the Stanford Dependency Parser u'\u2019' s manual [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We chose Amazon u'\u2019' s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform as a source of study participants</a>
