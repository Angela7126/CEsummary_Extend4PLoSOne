VOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p1
aVThe shared feature representation for direct transfer is derived from u'\u005cu03a9' 0 by replacing language-specific part-of-speech tags with universal ones [] and adding cross-lingual word clusters [] to word types
p2
aVFor source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data
p3
aVThe approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection
