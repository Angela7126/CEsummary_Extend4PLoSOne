VSince this constructed tree structure represents semantic, discourse, and structural information extracted from the similar Wikipedia paragraphs to each given instance, we can explore these more enriched features to build the topic tracking model using a subset tree kernel [ 5 ] which computes the similarity between each pair of trees in the feature space as follows
