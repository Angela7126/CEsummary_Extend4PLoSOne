<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To do this, an OT system contains four major components a generator Gen , which generates candidate output forms for the input; a set of constraints Con , which penalize candidates; a evaluation method Eval , which selects an winning candidate; and H , a language-particular weighting of constraints that Eval uses to determine the winning candidate</a>
