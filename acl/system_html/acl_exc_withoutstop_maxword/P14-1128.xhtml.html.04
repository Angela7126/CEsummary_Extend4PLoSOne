<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This section aims to further analyze the three primary observations concluded in Section 4.3 i ) word segmentation is useful to SMT; i u'\u2062' i ) the treebank and the bilingual segmentation knowledge are helpful, performing segmentation of different nature; and i u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' i ) the bilingual constraints lead to learn segmentations better tailored for SMT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Rather than playing the u'\u201c' hard u'\u201d' uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging u'\u201c' char-to-word u'\u201d' alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper proposes an alternative Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) model adapted to the SMT task, which seeks not only to maintain the advantages of a monolingual supervised model,</a>
