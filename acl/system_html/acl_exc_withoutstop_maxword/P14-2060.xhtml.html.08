<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For the u'\u201c' SVM u'\u201d' model, we extract features from the log likelihood and log odds scores associated with contextual n-grams, as well as from the pair LM probability and characteristics of the abbreviation itself</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second, we use log likelihood and log odds ratios (this time using standardly defined n-gram counts) to extract reliable bigram and trigram contexts for words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Multiple contextual n-grams may be observed, and we take the maximum log likelihood and log odds scores for each candidate expansion in the observed context</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We filter the set of n-grams based on both their log likelihood and log odds ratios, and provide those scores as features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion</a>
