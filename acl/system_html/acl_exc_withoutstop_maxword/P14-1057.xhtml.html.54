<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al proposed a task-specific representation, i.e.,, using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion method based on the relationships among the medical concepts [ 12 , 13 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Under such a situation, traditional retrieval functions would likely work well and generate satisfying retrieval performance since the relations among concepts are independent which is consistent with the assumptions made in traditional IR [ 18 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance</a>
