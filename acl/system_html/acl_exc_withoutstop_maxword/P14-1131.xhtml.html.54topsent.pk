VThe extension of CoSimRank to similarity across graphs is important for the application of bilingual lexicon extraction given a set of correspondences between nodes in two graphs A and B (corresponding to two different languages), a pair of nodes ( a u'\u005cu2208' A , b u'\u005cu2208' B ) is a good candidate for a translation pair if their node similarity is high
p1
aVOur key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step
p2
aVCoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u005cu2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes
p3
aVThus, we have reduced SimRank
