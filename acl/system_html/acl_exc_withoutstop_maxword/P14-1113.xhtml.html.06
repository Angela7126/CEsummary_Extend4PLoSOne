<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To verify this hypothesis, we compute the embedding offsets over all hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs in our training data and visualize them</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>That is, all word pairs ( x , y ) in the training data are first clustered into several groups, where word pairs in each group are expected to exhibit similar hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Then we elaborate on our proposed method composed of three major steps, namely, word embedding training, projection learning, and hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relation identification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in</a>
