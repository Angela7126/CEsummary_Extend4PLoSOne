VOut of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations
p1
aVIn addition, the lower ranked but correct relation translations also affect entity translation
p2
aVTherefore, even lower-performing EF boosted the entity translations, and in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1-score in the entity translation task
p3
aVA key contribution of this paper is using relation temporality for determining relation equivalence
p4
aVWe can clearly see that LF†shows higher recall than EF while EF†shows higher precision
p5
aVTherefore, we leverage relation temporality , which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality [ 8 , 6 , 16 ]
p6
aVIn clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations
p7
aVIn our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach [ 17 ] with [ 10 ] for a base translation matrix
p8
aVWe measure precision, recall, and F1-score based on the returned translation pairs for each English entity as it is done in [ 11 ]
p9
aVTable 3 shows the comparisons of†LF,†EF and their hybrid†LF+EF
p10
aVWe compare our hybrid approach, which is denoted by LF+EF with EF [ 11 ] , a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similarity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations [ 10 ] , and the seed translations Seed that we adopt [ 17 ] with PH+SM as a base translation matrix
p11
aVIn this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF [ 11 ]
p12
aVThus, we produce the hybrid relation translation, and we empirically set u'\u005cu039b' = 0.4
p13
aVTo address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1 ) [ 7 , 17 ]
p14
aVTo measure the effectiveness, we use a set of gold standard entity translation pairs which consist of 221 person entities and 52 organization entities
p15
aVUnfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N
p16
aVThis observation also holds in the bilingual environment by exploiting seed entity translations
p17
aVFor example, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film u'\u005cu2018' Drunken Master u'\u005cu2019' ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈÜâÊã≥) in both graphs
p18
aVOut of 3342 pairs, 399 are labeled as correct
p19
aVBased on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF
p20
aV[C3] Lastly, we have to eliminate false positives in relation temporality
p21
aVSpecifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as
p22
aVThus, we cannot acquire any common entity pair like (Russia, aircraft carrier) for deploy and {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (deploy at
p23
aV3 3 Our results leveraging relational temporality outperforms the reported results using entity temporality on the same data set
p24
aVAs shown in Figure 5 , d [ e , r , * ] is more distinctive and hence a key clue to find semantically equivalent relations
p25
aVThat is, we always {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) before we {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊâπÂáÜ (ratify) something and hence the temporal behavior of {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) is also very similar to that of ratify
p26
aVAs we can see from the difference in the numbers of the documents, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations
p27
aVOn the other hand, it can be correctly translated using†EF
p28
aVHowever, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' WTO u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfs‰∏ñË¥∏ÁªÑÁªá u'\u005cu2019' [ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' Jackie Chan u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô u'\u005cu2019' [ChengLong]
p29
aVIf an entity has a peak at some period (Figure 8 ), most relations that are coupled with the entity would have a peak at the very same period (Figure 8
p30
aVTherefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem
p31
aVThe number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031
p32
aVAs we emphasized in Section 3.3 , we can see their complementary property
p33
aVAs we mentioned in the introduction, traditional approaches leverage common co-occurring entity-pairs
p34
aV[C2] Considering entity-relation coupling distribution d [ e , r , * ] alone is not sufficient due to the domination of individual temporality
p35
aVTo address the first challenge, we use a finer-granularity unit for observing the temporality
p36
aVBut in this section, we only use d [ e , r , * ] for readability
p37
aVNote that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh evaluation criteria) may look low
p38
aVTheir hybrid LF+EF has both high precision and recall, thus has the highest F1-score
p39
aVFor example, we can obtain u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d' , but not u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed at ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤) an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d'
p40
aVAdditionally, we use the following features to consider absolute frequencies f u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' q u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) of textual elements as well because 1) we are more confident with more evidence and 2) in the comparable corpora, the equivalent elements are likely to show similar frequencies
p41
aVOur baseline implementation uses the one by [ 11 ] , and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit
p42
aVThat is, for ( r E , r C ) , we redefine the score as T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) / u'\u005cu2211' i u'\u005cu2208' [ 1 , k ] T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i ) where r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i is the i -th rank Chinese relation for r E by Equation 2

aVThe temporal similarity of the couplings, where J u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' D u'\u005cu2062' ( P , Q ) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence of two distributions P and Q , defined as J S D ( P , Q ) = 1 2 D ( P
