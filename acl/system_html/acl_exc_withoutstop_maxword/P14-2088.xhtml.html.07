<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section we first briefly describe the denoising autoencoder [ 12 ] , its application to domain adaptation, and the analytic marginalization of noise [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>2012 ) used dropout noise for domain adaptation, which we briefly review</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We show how it is possible to marginalize over both types of noise, and find that the solution for structured dropout is substantially simpler and more efficient than the mDA</a>
