<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Table 4 shows the results of the standard approach on the balanced and the unbalanced breast cancer and diabetes comparable corpora</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This configuration which simulates the use of unbalanced corpora leads us to think that using prediction with unbalanced comparable corpora should also increase the performance of the standard approach</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this section, we first describe the standard approach that deals with the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Second, we apply regression to unbalanced comparable corpora and study the impact of prediction when applied to the source texts, the target texts and both source and target texts of the used comparable corpora</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Overall, the prediction increases the performance of the standard approach especially for unbalanced corpora</a>
