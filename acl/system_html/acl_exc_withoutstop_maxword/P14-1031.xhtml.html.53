<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We develop a rich set of context-aware posterior constraints for sentence-level sentiment analysis by exploiting lexical and discourse knowledge</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This confirms that encoding lexical and discourse knowledge as posterior constraints allows the feature-based model to gain additional learning power for sentence-level sentiment prediction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also show that constraints derived from the discourse context can be highly useful for disambiguating sentence-level sentiment</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that these constraints are not necessary for our model and can be applied when the document-level sentiment labels are naturally</a>
