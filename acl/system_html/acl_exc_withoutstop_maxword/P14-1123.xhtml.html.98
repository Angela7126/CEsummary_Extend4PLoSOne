<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Taking an approach different from previous studies, we formulate the task of assigning a score of syntactic complexity to a spoken response as a classification problem given a spoken response, assign the response to a proficiency class</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The performance gain of Base+cos4 over Base , however, is not statistically significant at level = 0.01</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As a result, measures of grammatical complexity that are closely tied to a correct syntactic analysis are rendered unreliable</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Seeking to study the robustness of the measures derived using a shallow analysis, we next compare the two measures studied here, with respect to the impact of speech recognition errors on their correlation with scores of syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) found that while using measures of syntactic complexity obtained from transcriptions, errors in ASR transcripts caused over 0.40 drop in correlation from that found with manual</a>
