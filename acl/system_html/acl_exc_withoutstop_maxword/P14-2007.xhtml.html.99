<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Manual annotation of complexity scores may not be intuitive and reliable</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the idea of u'\u201c' annotation time u'\u201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hence, we use a cognitive technique to create our annotated dataset</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, saccade duration is not significant for annotation of short text, as in our case</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, we want to capture the most natural form of sentiment annotation</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An annotator will face difficulty in comprehension as well as sentiment judgment due to the complicated phrasal structure in this review</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, u'\u201c' simple time measurement u'\u201d' is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Sarcasm expressed in u'\u201c' It u'\u2019' s like an all-star salute to disney u'\u2019' s cheesy commercialism u'\u201d' leads to difficulty in sentiment annotation because of positive words like u'\u201c'</a>
