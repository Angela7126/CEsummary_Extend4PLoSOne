VMultiple approaches to generate good approximate solutions for joint multi-structure compression, based on Lagrangian relaxation to enforce equality between the sequential and syntactic inference subproblems
p1
aVAs discussed in § 2.4 , a maximum spanning tree is recovered from the output of the LP and greedily pruned in order to generate a valid integral solution while observing the imposed compression rate
p2
aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions
