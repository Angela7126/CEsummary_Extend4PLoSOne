VSubsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features
p1
aVOur base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u005cu2062' ( r
p2
aVAs illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity
p3
aVWe exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the (deterministic) tag for each word as its descriptor
p4
aVTherefore, we augment our existing model with standard sentiment analysis features that look at unigrams and bigrams in the span [ 31 ]
p5
aVAn anchored rule r is the conjunction of an unanchored grammar rule rule u'\u005cu2062' ( r ) and the start, stop, and split indexes where that rule is anchored, which we refer to as span u'\u005cu2062' ( r
p6
aVFor example, the first word in a constituent is a surface property, as is the word directly preceding the constituent
p7
aVAdding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over
