<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our framework accommodates any paraphrasing method, and in this paper we propose an association model that learns to associate natural language phrases that co-occur frequently in a monolingual parallel corpus, combined with a vector space model , which learns to score the similarity between vector representations of natural language utterances (Section 5</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model</a>
