VThe morphologically-generated candidates for a given source unlabeled phrase are initially defined as the target word sequences in the monolingual data that have the same stem sequence as one of the baseline u'\u005cu2019' s target translations for a source phrase which has the same stem sequence as the unlabeled source phrase
p1
aVThe morphological generation step adds to the target graph all target word sequences from the monolingual data that map to the same stem sequence as one of the target phrases occurring in the baseline phrase table
p2
aVIf a source phrase is found in the baseline phrase table it is called a labeled phrase its conditional empirical probability distribution over target phrases (estimated from the parallel data) is used as the label, and is subsequently never changed
