<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Lexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, we can use translation-specific cost functions based on sentence-level BLEU in order to boost similarity of translations to human reference translations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Table 5 shows examples where translations from Rebol and Rampion differ from the gold standard reference, and predictions by Rebol lead to positive feedback, while predictions by Rampion lead to negative feedback</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Firstly, update rules that require to compute a feature representation for the reference translation are suboptimal in SMT, because often human-generated reference translations cannot be generated by the SMT system</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It does not make use of the semantic parser, but defines positive and negative examples based on score s and cost c with respect to human</a>
