<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a dependency tree-based method to handle such multiple-constraint questions by (i) decomposing the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntax-based patterns; and (ii) intersecting the answers of all sub-questions as the final answers of the original question</a>
