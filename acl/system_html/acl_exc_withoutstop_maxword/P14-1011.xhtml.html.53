<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, we can imagine that learning semantic phrase embedding is reasonable if we are given gold vector representations of the phrases</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, our model can be easily adapted to learn semantic phrase embeddings using paraphrases</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>With the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In contrast, our BRAE model learns the semantic meaning for each phrase no matter whether it is short or relatively long</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Accordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Instead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT</a>
