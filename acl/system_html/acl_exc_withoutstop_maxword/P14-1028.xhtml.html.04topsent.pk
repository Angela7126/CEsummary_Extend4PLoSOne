VIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation
p1
aVAssuming we are at the i -th character of a sentence, besides the character embeddings, the tag embeddings of the previous tags are also considered 1 1 We also tried the architecture in which the tag embedding of current tag is also considered, but this did not bring much improvement and runs slower
p2
aVTo model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u005cu2208' T to tag j u'\u005cu2208' T

aVDespite tensor-based transformation being effective for capturing the interactions, introducing tensor-based transformation into neural network models to solve sequence labeling task is time prohibitive since
