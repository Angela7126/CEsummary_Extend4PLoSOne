VWe see that the language model baseline for English u'\u005cu2192' French shows the same substantial improvement over the baseline as our English u'\u005cu2192' Spanish results
p1
aVIn other words, for each word type or phrase type that occurs as a fragment in the training set, and which does not map to just a single translation, a classifier is trained
p2
aVThe main research question in this research is how to disambiguate an L1 word or phrase to its L2 translation based on an L2 context, and whether such cross-lingual contextual approaches provide added value compared to baseline models that are not context informed or compared to standard language models
p3
aVThird, we observe that adding the language model to our classifier leads to another significant gain (configuration l1r1 + LM in the results in Table 2
p4
aVThis intuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem to be better than any other when uniformly applied to all classifier experts, but it may well be that certain classifiers benefit from different feature selections
p5
aVA second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier
p6
aVThe language model is a trigram-based back-off language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, computed using SRILM [] and trained on the same training data as the translation model
p7
aVWhen presented with test data, in which the L1 fragment is explicitly marked, we first check whether there is ambiguity for this L1 fragment and if a direct translation is available in our simple mapping table
p8
aVOur full system, including the scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation, is implemented in Python and freely available as open-source from http://github.com/proycon/colibrita/
p9
aVAs expected, the LM baseline substantially outperforms the context-insensitive MLF baseline
p10
aVWords or phrases that always map to a single translation are stored in a simple mapping table, as a classifier would have no added value in such cases
p11
aVIf not, we check for the presence of a classifier expert for the offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by extracting the desired number of L2 local context words to the immediate left and right of this fragment and adding those to the feature vector
p12
aVPer classifier expert, the best scoring configuration was selected, referred to as the auto configuration in Table 2
p13
aVThe baseline selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2 fragment according to the phrase-translation table
p14
aVPreparing the data to build training and test data for our intended translation assistance system is not trivial, as the type of interactive translation assistant we aim to develop does not exist yet
p15
aVAn ideal test corpus would consist of L2 sentences with L1 fallback as crafted by L2 language learners with an L1 background
p16
aVWe therefore conducted a number of experiments with other language
