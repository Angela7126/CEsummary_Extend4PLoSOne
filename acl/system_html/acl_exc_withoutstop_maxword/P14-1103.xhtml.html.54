<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The model u'\u2019' s ability to infer constraint violation profiles without theoretical constraint structure provides an alternative solution to the problems of the traditionally innate and universal OT constraint set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Alternately, a binary matrix can directly capture non-binary constraints; converted existing non-binary constraints into a binary OT system by representing non-binary constraints as a set of equally-weighted overlapping constraints, each accounting for one violation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If constraints u'\u2019' weights are close together, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate u'\u2019' s probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus,</a>
