<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a naive baseline, we choose one candidate translation at random for each input Urdu sentence</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To establish an upper bound for our methods, and to determine if there exist high-quality Turker translations at all, we compute four oracle scores</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We use translation edit rate (TER) as a measure of translation similarity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This allows us to compare the BLEU score achieved by our methods against the BLEU scores achievable by professional translators</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the following sections, we evaluate each of our methods by calculating BLEU scores against the same four sets of three reference translations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since the oracles select from a small group of only 4 translations per source segment, they are not overly optimistic, and rather reflect the true potential of the collected translations</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation</a>
