VWe propose a number of features which are purely based on the textual similarity between the text of the turn, and the edited text and context
p1
aVAn edit-turn-pair is defined as a pair of an edit from a Wikipedia article u'\u005cu2019' s revision history and a turn from the discussion page bound to the same article
p2
aVSome of the false positives (i.e., non-corresponding pairs classified as corresponding) were caused by pairs where the revision (as judged by its comment or the edit context) is related to the turn text, however the specific edit in this pair is not
p3
aVThe search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article u'\u005cu2019' s discussion page
p4
aVSeveral of our features are based on metadata from both the edit and the turn
p5
aVHowever, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual
