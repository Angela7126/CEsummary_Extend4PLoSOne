VIn this section, we compare STRUCT to a state-of-the-art NLG system, CRISP, 1 1 We were unfortunately unable to get the PCRISP system to compile, and so we could not evaluate it and evaluate three hypotheses i) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as it generates increasingly large referring expressions, (ii) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as the size of the grammar which they use increases, and (iii) STRUCT is capable of communicating complex propositions, including multiple concurrent goals, negated goals, and nested subclauses
p1
aVWe find that, in all cases, these otherwise useless adjectives are included in the output of our generator, indicating that STRUCT is successfully balancing multiple communicative goals
p2
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u005cu201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found

aVThis setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast
