VThe spoken term detection task arises as a key subtask in applying NLP applications to spoken content
p1
aVIf we had perfectly accurate ASR in the language of the corpus, term detection is reduced to an exact string matching task
p2
aVThe BABEL task is modeled on the 2006 NIST Spoken Term Detection evaluation [] but focuses on limited resource conditions
p3
aVAlthough spoken term detection does not require the use of word-based automatic speech recognition (ASR), it is closely related
p4
aVSpoken term detection converts the raw acoustics into time-marked keyword occurrences, which may subsequently be fed (e.g., as a bag-of-terms) to standard NLP algorithms
p5
aVIn applying the burstiness quantity to term detection, we recall that the task requires us to locate a particular instance of a term, not estimate a count, hence the utility of N-gram language models predicting words in sequence
p6
aVTasks like topic identification and named-entity detection require transforming a continuous acoustic signal into a stream of discrete tokens which can then be handled by NLP and other statistical machine learning techniques
p7
aVIn general, we can think of using word repetitions to re-score term
