<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We develop a rich set of context-aware posterior constraints for sentence-level sentiment analysis by exploiting lexical and discourse knowledge</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that sentences with neutral sentiment can also contain such lexical patterns</a>
