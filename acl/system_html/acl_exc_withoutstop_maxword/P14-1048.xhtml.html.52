<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While research in discourse parsing can be partitioned into several directions according to different theories and frameworks, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [ 12 ] is probably the most ambitious one, because it aims to identify not only the discourse relations in a small local context, but also the hierarchical tree structure for the full text from the relations relating the smallest discourse units (called elementary discourse units, EDUs), to the ones connecting paragraphs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, HILDA u'\u2019' s approach also has obvious weakness the greedy algorithm may lead to poor performance due to local optima, and more importantly, the SVM classifiers are not well-suited for solving structural problems due to the difficulty of taking context into account</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, it is well motivated to use Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [ 10 ] , which is a discriminative probabilistic graphical model, to make predictions for a sequence of constituents surrounding the pair of interest</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition to efficiency, our use of a single CRF chain for all constituents can better capture the sequential dependencies among context, by taking into account the information from partially built discourse constituents, rather than bottom-level EDUs only</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs</a>
