<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score [ 27 ] for one professional translator (P1) using the other three (P2,3,4) as a reference set</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This allows us to compare the BLEU score achieved by our methods against the BLEU scores achievable by professional translators</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the following sections, we evaluate each of our methods by calculating BLEU scores against the same four sets of three reference translations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To establish an upper bound for our methods, and to determine if there exist high-quality Turker translations at all, we compute four oracle scores</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, each number reported in our experimental results is an average of four numbers, corresponding to the four possible ways of choosing 3 of the 4 reference sets</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using the raw translations without post-editing, our graph-based ranking method achieves a BLEU score of 38.89, compared to Zaidan and Callison-Burch ( 2011</a>
