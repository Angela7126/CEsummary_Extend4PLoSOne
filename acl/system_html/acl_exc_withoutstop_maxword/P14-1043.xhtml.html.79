<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Combining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B+Z u'\u201d' ), we get the best performance on English, which is also significantly better than both co-training ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B u'\u201d' ) and tri-training ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B=Z u'\u201d' ) on both English and Chinese</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Combining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and GParser ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B+G u'\u201d' ), we get higher oracle score (96.37% on English and 89.72% on Chinese) and higher syntactic divergence (1.085 candidate heads per word on English, and 1.188 on Chinese) than u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' Z+G u'\u201d' , which verifies our earlier discussion that Berkeley Parser produces more different structures than ZPar</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Using three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled</a>
