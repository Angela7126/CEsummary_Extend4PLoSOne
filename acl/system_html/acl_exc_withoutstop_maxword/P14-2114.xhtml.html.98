<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, it is often observed that events mentioned in tweets are also reported in news articles in the same period [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, the dataset was filtered by removing the events which are mentioned in less than 10 tweets</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We believe that in reality, events which are mentioned in very few tweets are less likely to be significant</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In [ 7 ] , social events involving two persons are extracted from multiple similar tweets using a factor graph by harvesting the redundancy in tweets</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial step since the results would directly impact the final extracted 4-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , l , k u'\u27e9'</a>
