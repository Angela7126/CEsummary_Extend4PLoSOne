<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Rather than playing the u'\u201c' hard u'\u201d' uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging u'\u201c' char-to-word u'\u201d' alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One of our main objectives is to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on unlabeled data, under a non-linear GP constraint encoding the bilingual knowledge</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Crucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]</a>
