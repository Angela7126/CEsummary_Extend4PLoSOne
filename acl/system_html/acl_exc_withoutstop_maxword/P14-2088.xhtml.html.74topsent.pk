VWe can exploit this structure by using an alternative dropout scheme for each token, choose exactly one feature template to keep, and zero out all other features that consider this token (transition feature templates such as u'\u005cu27e8' y t , y t - 1 u'\u005cu27e9' are not considered for dropout

aVBoth structure-aware domain adaptation algorithms perform as well as standard dropout u'\u005cu2014' and better than the well-known structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm [ 1 ] u'\u005cu2014' but structured dropout is more than an order-of-magnitude faster
p2
aVConsequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing
