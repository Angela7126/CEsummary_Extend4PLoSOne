VIn order to produce a solution to this subproblem, we use an LP relaxation of the relevant portion of the ILP from Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) by omitting integer constraints over the token and dependency variables in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' respectively
p1
aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions

aVThis approach requires O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 2 u'\u005cu2062' R ) time in order to identify the highest scoring sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' and corresponding
