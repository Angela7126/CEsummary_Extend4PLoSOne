<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In NLP, many of the probabilistic text models work in the discrete space [ 9 , 2 ] , but our model is different since the text features are sparse, we first perform kernel density estimates to smooth out the zeroing items, and then calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variables</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Again, the reason why we perform approximated inference is that exact inference in the high-dimensional Gaussian copula density is non-trivial, and might not have analytical solutions, but approximate inference using maximum density sampling from the Gaussian copula significantly relaxes the complexity of inference</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The idea behind copula theory is that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random vector can be represented in the form of uniform marginal cumulative distribution functions, and a copula that connects these marginal CDFs, which describes the correlations among the input random variables</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the experimental section, we notice that the proposed semiparametric Gaussian copula model has obtained promising results in various setups on three datasets in this text regression task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To calibrate the u'\u03a3' matrix, we make use of the power of randomness using the initial u'\u03a3' from MLE, we generate random samples from the Gaussian copula, and then concatenate previously generated joint of Gaussian inverse marginal CDFs with the newly generated random copula numbers, and re-estimate using MLE to derive</a>
