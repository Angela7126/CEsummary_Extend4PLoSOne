<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Co-occurring predicate and Co-occurring argument</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Similarly, the Co-occurring argument feature captures cases where p has another explicit argument, a u'\u2032'</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Statistical features in prior works mostly capture general properties of the predicate and the argument, like selectional preferences, lexical similarities, etc</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Two terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument , aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p u'\u2032' , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic</a>
