VIt is calculated by generating an alignment between the tokens in the candidate and reference sentences, with the aim of a 1:1 alignment between tokens and minimising the number of chunks ch of contiguous and identically ordered tokens in the sentence pair
p1
aVIt is defined as the geometric mean of the effective n-gram precision scores, multiplied by the brevity penalty factor B u'\u005cu2062' P to penalise short translations p n measures the effective overlap by calculating the proportion of the maximum number of n-grams co-occurring between a candidate and a reference and the total number of n-grams in the candidate text
p2
aVThe modifications available are insertion, deletion, substitute a single word, and shift a word an arbitrary distance ter is expressed as the percentage of the sentence that needs to be changed, and can be greater than 100 if the candidate is longer than the reference
p3
aVThe alignment is based on exact token matching, followed by Wordnet synonyms, and then stemmed tokens
p4
aVOn the Flickr8k data set, all evaluation measures can be classified as either weakly correlated or moderately correlated with human judgements and all results are significant ter is only weakly correlated with human judgements but could prove useful in comparing the types of differences between models

aVIt is therefore difficult to directly compare the results of our correlation analysis against Hodosh et al u'\u005cu2019' s agreement analysis, but they also reach the
