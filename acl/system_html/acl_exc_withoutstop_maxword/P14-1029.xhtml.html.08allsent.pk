VBy examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment
p1
aVFigure 1 illustrates the effect of a common list of negators on sentiment as observed on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank
p2
aVFigure 1 shows the distribution of the effect of negators on sentiment without considering further semantics of the arguments
p3
aVThe shifting hypothesis [] , however, assumes that negators change sentiment values by a constant amount
p4
aVMaking the basic shifting model to be dependent on the negators (model 4) reduces the prediction error significantly as compared with the error of the basic shifting (model 3
p5
aVA different hypothesis, called the shifting hypothesis in this paper, assumes that negators change the sentiment values by a constant amount []
p6
aVTo understand this further, we plot in Figure 3 the behavior of different negators the x-axis is a subset of our negators and the y-axis denotes absolute shifting in sentiment values
p7
aVThis model learns the syntax and semantics of the negator u'\u005cu2019' s argument with a recursive neural network
p8
aVData As described earlier, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] has manually annotated, real-valued sentiment values for all phrases in parse trees
p9
aVThe recently available Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] renders manually annotated, real-valued sentiment scores for all phrases in parse trees
p10
aVFour of them have significantly different shifting power when composed with positive or negative phrases, which can explain why the polarity-based shifting model achieves improvement over the basic shifting model
p11
aVUnderstanding the impact of negation on sentiment is essential in automatic analysis of sentiment
p12
aVThis paper describes a quantitative study of the effect of a list of frequent negators on sentiment
p13
aVIn previous research, some influential, widely adopted assumptions posit the effect of negators to be independent of both the specific negators and the semantics and syntax of the arguments
p14
aVWe calculated their shifting power in the same manner as for the negators and found three diminishers having shifting capability in the shifting range of these negators
p15
aVFurthermore, modeling the syntax and semantics with the state-of-the-art recursive neural network (model 7 and 8) can dramatically improve the performance over model 6
p16
aVThat is, the model parameters are only based on the sentiment value of the arguments
p17
aVWe extend RNTN to directly consider the sentiment information of arguments
p18
aVA recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis
p19
aVNote that the two neural network based models incorporate the syntax and semantics by representing each node with a vector
p20
aVThe figure includes five most frequently used negators found in the sentiment treebank
p21
aVThis corpus provides us with the data to further understand the quantitative behavior of negators, as the effect of negators can now be studied with arguments of rich syntactic and semantic variety
p22
aVFigure 4 shows the shifting capacity of negators when they modify positive (blue boxes) or negative phrases (red boxes
p23
aVWe then extend the models to be dependent on the negators and demonstrate that such a simple extension can significantly improve the performance of fitting to the human annotated data
p24
aVThe same is true for the polarity-based shifting (model 5), reflecting that the roles of negators are different when modifying positive and negative phrases
p25
aVNote that this is a special case of what the neural network based models can model
p26
aVThis shifting model is based on negators and the polarity of the text they modify constants can be different for each negator-polarity pair
p27
aVThe PSTN model, which takes into account the human-annotated prior sentiment of arguments, performs the best
p28
aVPSTN outperforms RNTN at greater depths, where the syntax and semantics are more complicated and harder to model
p29
aVThe table shows that the basic reversing and shifting heuristics do capture negators u'\u005cu2019' behavior to some degree, as their MAE scores are higher than that of the baseline
p30
aVModeling syntax and semantics We have seen above that modeling syntax and semantics through the-state-of-the-art neural networks help improve the fitting performance
p31
aVAutomatic sentiment analysis The expression of sentiment is an integral component of human language
p32
aVPolarity-based shifting As will be shown in our experiments, negators can have different shifting power when modifying a positive or a negative phrase
p33
aVIn the process of semantic composition, the effect of negators could depend on the syntax and semantics of the text spans they modify
p34
aVNegation modeling Negation is a general grammatical category pertaining to the changing of the truth values of propositions; negation modeling is not limited to sentiment
p35
aVIn general, we argue that one should always consider modeling negators individually in a sentiment analysis system
p36
aVThe original RNTN and the PSTN predict 5-class sentiment for each negated phrase; we map the output to real-valued scores based on the scale that used to map real-valued sentiment scores to sentiment categories
p37
aVWhen the depths are within 4, the RNTN performs very well and the (human annotated) prior sentiment of arguments used in PSTN does not bring additional improvement over RNTN
p38
aVWe begin with previously proposed methods that leverage heuristics to model the behavior of negators
p39
aVThis model further improves the fitting performance on the test data
p40
aVIn this paper, we call a model based on such assumptions a non-lexicalized model
p41
aVFor the former, we adopt the recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) proposed recently by , which has showed to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis
p42
aVThe errors made by model 6 is bumpy, as the model considers no semantics and hence its errors are not dependent on the depths
p43
aVNegation modeling for sentiment An early yet influential reversing assumption conjectures that a negator reverses the sign of the sentiment value of the modified text [] , e.g.,, from +0.5 to -0.5, or vice versa
p44
aVThis provides us with the training and evaluation data to study the effect of negators with syntax and semantics of different complexity in a natural setting
p45
aVAbove, we have considered the semantics of the negators
p46
aVEach node of the parse tree is a fixed-length vector that encodes compositional semantics and syntax, which can be used to predict the sentiment of this node
p47
aVWe call this model negator-based shifting
p48
aVWe regard the negators u'\u005cu2019' behavior as an underlying function embedded in annotated data; we aim to model this function from different aspects
p49
aVThe phrases at all tree nodes were manually annotated with one of 25 sentiment values that uniformly span between the positive and negative poles
p50
aVFor example, if a phrase very good modified by a negator not appears in the training and test data, the system can simply memorize the sentiment score of not very good in training and use this score at testing
p51
aVMuch recent work considers sentiment analysis from a semantic-composition perspective [] , which achieved the state-of-the-art performance used a collection of hand-written compositional rules to assign sentiment values to different granularities of text spans proposed a learning-based framework
p52
aVFollowing the idea of , we regard the sentiment of p 1 as a prior sentiment as it has not been affected by the specific context (negators), so we denote our method as prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN
p53
aVThe number of parameters in this model is the multiplication of number of negators by two (the number of sentiment polarities
p54
aVNegators appearing at deeper levels of the tree tend to have more complicated syntax and semantics
p55
aVAs we have discussed above, we will use the human annotated sentiment for the arguments, same as in the models discussed in Section 3
p56
aVFor example, a simple yet influential hypothesis posits that a negator reverses the sign of the sentiment value of the modified text []
p57
aVNote that depending on different purposes, p 1 s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n can take the value of the automatically predicted sentiment distribution obtained in forward propagation, the gold sentiment annotation of node p 1 , or even other normalized prior sentiment value or confidence score from external sources (e.g.,, sentiment lexicons or external training data
p58
aVIn principle neural network is able to fit very complicated functions [] , and in this paper, we adapt the state-of-the-art approach described in [] to help understand the behavior of negators specifically
p59
aVIn addition, we explicitly incorporate the prior sentiment of the argument and observe that this information helps reduce fitting errors
p60
aV1 1 The sentiment values have been linearly rescaled from the original range [0, 1] to [-0.5, 0.5]; in the figure a negative or positive value corresponds to a negative or a positive sentiment respectively; zero means neutral
p61
aVThe figure shows that both RNTN and PSTN perform much better at all depths than the model 6 in Table 1
p62
aVNegators can interact with arguments in complex ways
p63
aVSuch models work in a bottom-up fashion over the parse tree of a sentence to infer the sentiment label of the sentence as a composition of the sentiment expressed by its constituting parts
p64
aVNegation is often expressed through the use of negative signals or negators u'\u005cu2013' words like isn u'\u005cu2019' t and never , and it can significantly affect the sentiment of its scope
p65
aVBasic shifting Similarly, a shifting based model depends on s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) only, which can be written as
p66
aVWe first evaluate the modeling capabilities of two influential heuristics and show that they capture only very limited regularity of negators u'\u005cu2019' effect
p67
aVDiscriminating negators The results in Table 1 has demonstrated the benefit of discriminating negators
p68
aVWe will show that this model also statistically significantly outperforms the basic shifting without overfitting, although the number of parameters have increased
p69
aVEach dot in the figure corresponds to a negated phrase in the treebank
p70
aVThis shows that the boundary between negators and diminishers can by fuzzy
p71
aVEarly work on automatic sentiment analysis includes the widely cited work of [] , among others
p72
aVAfter the models are trained, they are applied to predict the sentiment of the test data
p73
aVTo train the model, one first needs to calculate the predicted sentiment distribution for each node
p74
aVNext, we evaluate a recently proposed composition model (Socher, 2013) that relies on both the negator and the argument
p75
aVFor example, we can see that the negator u'\u005cu201c' is_never u'\u005cu201d' on average shifts the sentiment of the arguments by 0.26, which is a significant change considering the range of sentiment value is [0, 1]
p76
aVBelow, we take a closer look at the fitting errors made at different depths of the sentiment treebank
p77
aVMerging these two models yields additional improvement (model 6
p78
aVIn this paper, we refer to a negation word as the negator (e.g.,, isn u'\u005cu2019' t ), a text span being modified by and composed with a negator as the argument (e.g.,, very good ), and entire phrase (e.g.,, isn u'\u005cu2019' t very good ) as the negated phrase
p79
aVSince then, there has been an explosion of research addressing various aspects of the problem, including detecting subjectivity, rating and classifying sentiment, labeling sentiment-related semantic roles (e.g.,, target of sentiment), and visualizing sentiment (see surveys by and
p80
aVThe x-axis is the sentiment score of its argument s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) and y-axis the sentiment score of the entire negated phrase s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' )
p81
aVThe first row of the table is a random baseline, which simply guesses the sentiment value for each test case randomly in the range [0,1]
p82
aVEvaluation metrics We use the mean absolute error (MAE) to evaluate the models, which measures the averaged absolute offsets between the predicted sentiment values and the gold standard
p83
aVHowever, in our current study, we focus on exploring the behavior of negators
p84
aVFurther semantic or syntactic information from either the negators or the phrases they modify could be helpful
p85
aVThe more recent work of [] proposed models based on recursive neural networks that do not rely on any heuristic rules
p86
aVWhen incorporating this memorizing strategy into model (6), we observed a MAE score of 0.1222
p87
aVThe literature contains interesting research attempting to model and understand the behavior (reviewed in Section 2
p88
aVThe most straightforward way of expanding the non-lexicalized heuristics is probably to make the models to be dependent on the negators
p89
aVBelow, we further make the models to be dependent on the arguments
p90
aVFor the latter, we propose a prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN) to take into account the prior sentiment of the argument s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' )
p91
aVThe question then is that whether and how much incorporating further syntax and semantic information can help better fit or predict the negation effect
p92
aVOne may consider that a straightforward way of considering the semantics of the modified phrases is simply memorizing them
p93
aVWhen calculating its vector, we aim to directly engage the sentiment information of its right child, i.e.,, the argument
p94
aVOverall regression performance Table 1 shows the overall fitting performance of all models
p95
aVIn Figure 5 , the x-axis corresponds to different depths and y-axis is the mean absolute errors (MAE
p96
aVWe will show that this simple modification improves the fitting performance statistically significantly
p97
aVThe non-uniform distribution in Figure 1 has showed certain correlations between the sentiment values of s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) and s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) , and such information has been leveraged in the models discussed in Section 3
p98
aVWe search these negators in the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and normalize the same negators to a single form; e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' is n u'\u005cu2019' t u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' isn u'\u005cu2019' t u'\u005cu201d' , and u'\u005cu201c' is not u'\u005cu201d' are all normalized to u'\u005cu201c' is_not u'\u005cu201d'
p99
aVThis is actually an interesting place to extend the current recursive neural network to consider extrinsic knowledge
p100
aVThe negator list will be discussed later in the paper
p101
aVWe then propose to extend them to consider lexical information of the negators themselves
p102
aVAlternatively, if the modeling has to be done in groups, one should consider clustering valence shifters by their shifting abilities in training or external data
p103
aVIn written text, sentiment is conveyed with word senses and their composition, and in speech also via prosody such as pitch []
p104
aVIn this paper, we use a list of most frequent negators that include the words not , no , never , and their combinations with auxiliaries (e.g.,, didn u'\u005cu2019' t
p105
aVHere, we assume the sentiment task has m classes
p106
aVThis could suggest that additional external knowledge, e.g.,, that from human-built resources or automatically learned from other data (e.g.,, as in [] ), including sentiment that cannot be inferred from its constituent expressions, might be incorporated to benefit the current neural-network-based models as prior knowledge
p107
aVA typical model falling into this category is the reversing hypothesis discussed in Section 2 , where a negator simply reverses the sentiment score s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) to be - s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ; i.e.,, f u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) = - s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' )
p108
aVIn general, we can simply define this category of models in Equation 1
p109
aVNote also that instead of determining these constants by human intuition, we use the training data to find the constants in all shifting-based models as well as for the parameters in other models
p110
aVMoreover, the figure shows that same or similar s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) scores (x-axis) can correspond to very different s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) scores (y-axis), which, to some degree, suggests the potentially complicated behavior of negators
p111
aVIn Figure 2 , the red portion shows the added components of PSTN
p112
aVNegator-based shifting We can simply extend the basic shifting model above to consider the lexical information of negators f u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) = s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) - s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) * C u'\u005cu2062' ( w n
p113
aVAs shown in the black portion of Figure 2 , each instance of RNTN corresponds to a binary parse tree of a given sentence
p114
aVOn the other hand, the errors of RNTN and PSTN monotonically increase with depths, indicating the increase in the task difficulty
p115
aVEach occurrence of a negator and the phrase it is directly composed with in the treebank, i.e.,, u'\u005cu27e8' w n , w u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu27e9' , is considered a data point in our study
p116
aVFor each negator, a 95% confidence interval is shown by the boxes in the figure, which is calculated with the bootstrapping resampling method
p117
aVOther approaches to negation modeling have been discussed in []
p118
aVIn the formula, r u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) is a certain type of representation for the argument w u'\u005cu2192' and it models the semantics or/and syntax of the argument
p119
aVThere exist different ways of incorporating more complicated syntactic and semantic information
p120
aVThe approaches of modeling this include bag-of-word-based models
p121
aVWe intend to devise a model that implements Equation 4
p122
aVIt u'\u005cu2019' s not surprising that memorizing the phrases has some benefit, but such matching relies on the exact reoccurrences of phrases
p123
aVThat is, the non-uniform information shown in Figure 1 is not directly modeled
p124
aVThe split of training and test data is same as specified in []
p125
aVThe approach leverages a principled method, the forward and backward propagation, to learn a vector representation to optimize the system performance
p126
aVAs intuitively shown in Figure 1 , the capability of the non-lexicalized heuristics might be limited
p127
aVdefine negation to be u'\u005cu201c' a grammatical category that allows the changing of the truth value of a proposition u'\u005cu201d'
p128
aVFigure 3 also includes three diminishers (the white bars), i.e.,, barely , unlikely , and superficial
p129
aVIn the backpropogation process of the training, each node (except the root node) in the tree carries two kinds of errors the local softmax error and the error passing down from its parent node
p130
aVDuring learning, following the method used by the RNTN model in [] , PSTN also aims to minimize the cross-entropy error between the predicted distribution y i u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' m × 1 at node i and the target distribution t i u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' m × 1 at that node
p131
aVA major difference of RNTN from the conventional recursive neural network (RRN) [] is the use of the tensor V in order to directly capture the multiplicative interaction of two input vectors, although the matrix W implicitly captures the nonlinear interaction between the input vectors
p132
aVThe sentences were parsed with the Stanford parser []
p133
aVThe values are normalized to the range of [0, 1]
p134
aVTo this end, we make use of the sentiment class information of p 1 , noted as p 1 s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n
p135
aVThis approach performs significantly better than those mentioned above
p136
aVThe constant C now can take one of two possible values
p137
aVThat is, given a negated phrase (e.g.,, isn u'\u005cu2019' t very good ) and the sentiment score of its argument (e.g.,, s u'\u005cu2062' ( ` u'\u005cu2062' ` u'\u005cu2062' v u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' y u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2032' ) = 0.5 ), we focus on understanding the negator u'\u005cu2019' s quantitative behavior in yielding the sentiment score of the negated phrase s u'\u005cu2062' ( ` u'\u005cu2062' ` u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' v u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' y u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2032' )
p138
aVThe training of RNTN uses conventional forward-backward propagation
p139
aVSome automatic methods to detect opposites were proposed by and
p140
aVFor example, in the work of [] , a feature not_good will be created if the word good is encountered within a predefined range after a negator
p141
aVBy following [] , we extracted 319 diminishers (also called understatement or downtoners ) from General Inquirer 3 3 http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/ inquirer/
p142
aVSpecifically, we first compute the prediction errors in all tree nodes bottom-up
p143
aVWe can see that the reversing assumption (the red diagonal line) does capture some regularity of human perception, but rather roughly
p144
aVIn total, we collected 2,261 pairs, including 1,845 training and 416 test cases
p145
aVThe data contain around 11,800 sentences from movie reviews that were originally collected by
p146
aVConsider the node p 2 in Figure 2
p147
aVWe can observe statistically significant differences of shifting abilities between many negator pairs such as that between u'\u005cu201c' is_never u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' do_not u'\u005cu201d' as well as between u'\u005cu201c' does_not u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' can_not u'\u005cu201d'
p148
aVWe consider two models in this study one drops s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) in Equation 4 and directly models f u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , r u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' )
p149
aVMore specifically, MAE is calculated as
p150
aVThe incoming error message of node a can be calculated similarly
p151
aVMore details can be found in []
p152
aV2 2 Similar distribution is observed in other data such as Tweets []
p153
aVThat is, each negator has its own C
p154
aVIn general, a negated expression and the opposite of the expression may or may not convey the same meaning
p155
aVFor example, paraphrase and contradiction detection systems rely on detecting negated expressions and opposites []
p156
aVAfter this forward process, we then calculate the derivatives of the softmax classifiers at each node in the tree in a top-down fashion
p157
aVAs shown in Equation 6 , for the node vector p 1 u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × 1 , we employ a matrix, namely W s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × ( d + m ) and a tensor, V s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' ( d + m ) × ( d + m ) × d , aiming at explicitly capturing the interplays between the sentiment class of p 1 , denoted as p 1 s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n ( u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' m × 1 ), and the negator a
p158
aVThat is, the error for a sentence is calculated as
p159
aVThis can be written as
p160
aVDuring the derivative computation, the two errors will be summed up as the complement incoming error for the node
p161
aVWith the new matrix and tensor, we then have u'\u005cu0398' = ( V , V s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n , W , W s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n , W l u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l , L ) as the PSTN model u'\u005cu2019' s parameters
p162
aVInference and learning in PSTN follow a forward-backward propagation process similar to that in [] , and for completeness, we depict the details as follows
p163
aVwhere s i g n is the standard sign function which determines if the constant C should be added to or deducted from s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n the constant is added to a negative s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) but deducted from a positive one
p164
aVNote that mean square error (MSE) is another widely used measure for regression, but it is less intuitive for out task here
p165
aVThe vector of a node, say p 2 in Figure 2 , is computed from the d -dimensional vectors of its two children, namely a and p 1 ( a , p 1 u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × 1 ) , with a non-linear function
p166
aVM u'\u005cu2062' A u'\u005cu2062' E = 1 N u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2211' u'\u005cu27e8' w n , w u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu27e9' s ^ u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) - s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) where s ^ u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) denotes the gold sentiment value and s u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , w u'\u005cu2192' ) the predicted one for the pair u'\u005cu27e8' w n , w u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu27e9' , and N is the total number of test instances
p167
aVHere, L denotes the vector representations of the word dictionary
p168
aVThe above negation hypotheses rely on s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192'
p169
aVIt bridges between the models we have discussed above that use either s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) or r u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' )

aVCombined shifting We further combine the negator-based shifting and polarity-based shifting above f u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) = s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) - s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) * C u'\u005cu2062' ( w n , s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) )

aVWith this notation, the error for the root node p 2 can be formulated as follows
p172
aVNow, let u'\u005cu2019' s form the equations for computing the error for the two children of the p 2 node
p173
aVTo minimize E u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu0398' ) , the gradient of the objective function with respect to each of the parameters in u'\u005cu0398' is calculated efficiently via backpropagation through structure, as proposed by
p174
aVWe denote the complete incoming error and the softmax error vector for node i as u'\u005cu0394' i , c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × 1 and u'\u005cu0394' i , s u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × 1 , respectively
p175
aVFor example, if y i = [ 0.5 u'\u005cu2004' 0.5 u'\u005cu2004' 0 u'\u005cu2004' 0 u'\u005cu2004' 0 ] , meaning this phrase has a 0.5 probability to be in the first category (strong negative) and 0.5 for the second category (weak negative), the resulting p i r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' l will be 0.2 (0.5*0.1+0.5*0.3
p176
aVAs a result, the vector of p 2 is calculated as follows
p177
aVThe difference for the error at p 2 and its two children is that the error for the latter will need to compute the error message passing down from p 2
p178
aVWith the results from Equation 4.2.1 , we then can calculate the derivatives for the W s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n at node p 2 using the following equation

aVwhere, u'\u005cu039b' represents the regularization hyperparameters, and j u'\u005cu2208' m denotes the j -th element of the multinomial target distribution
p180
aVThe depth here is defined as the longest distance between the root of a negator-phrase pair u'\u005cu27e8' w n , w u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu27e9' and their descendant leafs
p181
aVThere exist different ways of implementing r u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192'
p182
aVSpecifically, we conduct the mapping with the formula p i r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' l = y i u'\u005cu22c5' [ 0.1 u'\u005cu2004' 0.3 u'\u005cu2004' 0.5 u'\u005cu2004' 0.7 u'\u005cu2004' 0.9 ] ; i.e.,, we calculate the dot product of the posterior probability y i and the scaling vector
p183
aVwhere, W u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × ( d + d ) and V u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' ( d + d ) × ( d + d ) × d are the matrix and tensor for the composition function
p184
aVThe other takes into account s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) too
p185
aVSimilarly, for the derivative of each slice k ( k = 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , d ) of the V s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n tensor, we have the following
p186
aVFollowing this notation, we have the error message for the two children of p 2 , provided that we have the u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n
p187
aVWe denote the error passing down as u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n , where the left child and the right child of p 2 take the 1 s u'\u005cu2062' t and 2 n u'\u005cu2062' d half of the error u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n , namely u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n [ 1 d ] and u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n [ d + 1
p188
aVNote that the gradient calculations for the V , W , W l u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l , L are the same as that of presented in []
p189
aVThus, we explore the use of two different constants for these two situations, i.e.,, f u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) = s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) - s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) ) * C u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' ( w u'\u005cu2192' ) )

aVFor example, not alive has the same meaning as dead , however, not tall does not always mean short
p191
aVFor completeness, we briefly review it here
p192
aVWe will discuss the gradient computation for the V s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n and W s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n in detail next
p193
aVFinally, we can finish the above equations with the following formula for computing u'\u005cu0394' p 2 , d u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' w u'\u005cu2062' n
