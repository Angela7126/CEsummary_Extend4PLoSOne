<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Figures 6 and 7 show the average distance from the convergence reward as a function of the number of episodes per epoch during training, for 4 and 5 fruits respectively</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, when converging to the maximum total utility solution, in the case of 4 fruits (4 apples and 4 oranges), the average reward of the two agents should be 1200 minus 10 for making or accepting an offer</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We vary the scenario complexity (i.e.,, the quantity of resources to be shared and consequently the state space size), the number of training episodes, the learning rate, and the exploration rate</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given that Agent 1 is more interested in apples and Agent 2 cares more about oranges, the maximum total utility solution would be the case where each agent offers to get all the fruits it cares about and to give its interlocutor all the fruits it does not care about, and the other agent accepts this offer</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is to make all graphs comparable because in all cases the optimal average distance from the convergence reward of the two agents should be equal to 10 (make the optimal offer or accept the optimal offer that the other agent makes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We call 1200 (or 1500) the convergence reward , i.e.,, the reward after converging to the maximum total utility solution if we do not take into account the action penalty</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For 7 fruits PHC-W appears to perform worse than Q-learning but this is because, as we can see in Figure 5 , in this case more than 400,000 episodes per epoch are required for convergence</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this case the environment of a learning agent is one or more other agents that can also be learning at the same time</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>On the other hand when the agent is u'\u201c' losing u'\u201d' the learning rate u'\u0394' L u'\u2062' F should be high so that the agent has more time to adapt to the other agents u'\u2019' policies, which also facilitates convergence</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus the reward for Agent 1 is 1190, the reward for Agent 2 is 1190, and the average reward of the two agents is also 1190</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For 5 fruits the average reward should be 1500 minus 10, and so forth</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It is clear that as the state space becomes larger 100,000 training episodes per epoch are not enough for convergence</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As the number of fruits increases, Q-learning starts performing worse than the multi-agent RL algorithms</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Also, they have human-like constraints of imperfect information about each other; they do not know each other u'\u2019' s reward function or degree of rationality (during learning our agents can be irrational</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Agent 1 makes an offer to Agent 2, namely 0 apples and 4 oranges, and Agent 2</a>
