VFurther, similar to real children (see Figure 1 ) the model presented in this paper develops beyond this error by the end of its training, 12 12 It is important to note that the unique argument constraint prevents the current model from actually getting the correct, conjoined-subject parse, but it no longer exhibits agent-first bias, an important step for acquiring passives, which occurs between 3 and 4 years [] whereas the BabySRL models still make this error after training
