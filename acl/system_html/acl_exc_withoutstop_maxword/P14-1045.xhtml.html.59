<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They can be divided in three groups, according to their origin they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The resulting feature we used is the product of this measure for neighbour a and neighbour b</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We similarly defined a tf u'\u22c5' ipf measure based on the frequency of a word within a paragraph with respect to its frequency within the text</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An important aspect is thus to guarantee that there is a correlation between the similarity score (Lin u'\u2019' s score here), and the evaluated relevance of the neighbour pairs</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>each neighbour productivity p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d a and p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d b are defined as the numbers of neighbours of respectively neighbour a and neighbour b in the database (thus related tokens with a similarity above the threshold), from which we derive three features as for frequencies the min, the max, and the log of the product</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among</a>
