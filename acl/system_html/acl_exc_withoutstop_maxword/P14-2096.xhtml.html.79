<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We can calculate the entropy of the distribution as a value for SVM</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The similarity values generated by title matching and title similarity are used directly as real value features in the SVM model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We regard the appearance of the English title in the first sentence of a Baidu Baike article as a binary feature</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Because of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article u'\u201c' Nero u'\u201d' and the corresponding Chinese article is low</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the title similarity method, every Chinese article title is represented as a vector, and each distinct character in all these titles is a dimension of all vectors</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Each topic is represented by a distribution of words, and each word has a probability score used to measure its contribution to the topic</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Then, cosine similarity between this vector and the vector of each Chinese title is measured as title</a>
