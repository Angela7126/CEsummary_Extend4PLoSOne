VIn the third section, we describe experiments regarding the detection of machine translation and in the fourth section we discuss the use of detection techniques as a machine translation quality estimation method
p1
aVProminent among these are how to evaluate the quality of such a system efficiently and how to detect the output of such systems (for example, to avoid using it circularly as input for refining MT systems
