VWe denote the frames that associate with u'\u005cu2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u005cu2113'
p1
aVWe used the same test set as Das et al containing 23 documents with 4,458 predicates
p2
aVThe mapping from g u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) to the low dimensional space u'\u005cu211d' m is a linear transformation, so the model parameters to be learnt are the matrix M u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n u'\u005cu2062' k × m as well as the embedding of each possible frame label, represented as another matrix Y u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' F × m where there are F frames in total
p3
aVFirst, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in § 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation
p4
aVSubsequently, we learn a mapping from this initial
