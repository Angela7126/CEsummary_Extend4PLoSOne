<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u2019' s score; r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' g b - a is defined similarly and again we consider as features the min, max and log-product of these ranks</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>each neighbour productivity p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d a and p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d b are defined as the numbers of neighbours of respectively neighbour a and neighbour b in the database (thus related tokens with a similarity above the threshold), from which we derive three features as for frequencies the min, the max, and the log of the product</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical</a>
