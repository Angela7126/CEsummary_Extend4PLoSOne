<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The novelty of our work is three-fold a) The proposition of a metric to measure complexity of sentiment annotation, (b) The adaptation of past work that uses eye-tracking for NLP in the context of sentiment annotation, (c) The learning of regressors that automatically predict SAC using linguistic features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Also, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensemble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences</a>
