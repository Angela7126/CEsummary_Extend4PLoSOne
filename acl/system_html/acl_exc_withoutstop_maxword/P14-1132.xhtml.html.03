<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this setting, we assume that our system possesses linguistic and visual information for a set of concepts in the form of text-based representations of words and image-based vectors of the corresponding objects, used for vision-to-language-mapping training</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We implement this second setup ( w u'\u2192' v ) by training the projection function f proj w u'\u2192' v which maps linguistic vectors to visual ones</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
