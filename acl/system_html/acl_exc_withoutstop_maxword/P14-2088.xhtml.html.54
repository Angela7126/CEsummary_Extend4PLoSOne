<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We can exploit this structure by using an alternative dropout scheme for each token, choose exactly one feature template to keep, and zero out all other features that consider this token (transition feature templates such as u'\u27e8' y t , y t - 1 u'\u27e9' are not considered for dropout</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Both structure-aware domain adaptation algorithms perform as well as standard dropout u'\u2014' and better than the well-known structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm [ 1 ] u'\u2014' but structured dropout is more than an order-of-magnitude faster</a>
