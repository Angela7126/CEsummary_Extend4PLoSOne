<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context ( stative , dynamic , both ), we assume a supervised learning setting and explore features mined from a large background corpus, distributional features, and instance-based features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The experiments presented in this section aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature sets described in the previous section, focusing on the challenging cases of verb types unseen in the training data and highly ambiguous verbs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We show that this method works better than using only type-based features, especially for verbs with ambiguous aspectual class</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Siegel ( 1998a ) investigates a classification method for the verb have in context; inspired by this work, our present work goes one step further and uses a larger set of instance-based contextual features to perform experiments on a set of 20 verbs</a>
