aVThe input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' , while the similarity measure remains unchanged

aVDistributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts
