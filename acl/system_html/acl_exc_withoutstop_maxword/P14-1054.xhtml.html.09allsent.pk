aVAnd four constraint conditions are proposed to transform the candidate features into combined features
p2
aVFive candidate feature sets are employed to generate the combined features
p3
aVIt is a subset of the combined feature, generated by four constraint conditions singleton , position sensitive , bin sensitive and semantic pair
p4
aVBased on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction
p5
aVIn this section, the employed candidate features are discussed
p6
aVWe proposed four constraint conditions to generate the soft constraint features
p7
aVOmni-word Feature
p8
aVThe soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u005cu201c' soft constraint u'\u005cu201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions
p9
aVPosition Feature
p10
aVEntity types and subtypes are employed as semantic pair
p11
aVHead noun and adjacent entity POS tag are employed to combine with positional information
p12
aVTo use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions
p13
aVThe head noun (or head mention) of entity mention is manually annotated
p14
aV[] denotes the position structure of entity mention pair
p15
aVBoth head noun and POS tag are position sensitive
p16
aVIn Table 4 , the performances of candidate features are compared when different constraint conditions was employed
p17
aVSemantic pair can capture both the semantic and structure information in a relation mention
p18
aVOn the other hand, the Omni-word feature denoting all the possible words in the relation mention may generate features as
p19
aVIn the following experiments, focusing on Chinese relation extraction, we will analyze the performance of candidate feature sets and study the influence of the constraint conditions
p20
aVIn our research, we proposed an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method
p21
aVIn our experiment, the Head noun and POS Tag are utilized as position sensitive features, which has been introduced in Section 3.1
p22
aVIn this section, methodologies of the Omni-word feature and the soft constraint are tested
p23
aVTo sum up, among the five candidate feature sets, the position feature is used as a singleton feature
p24
aVFeatures in u'\u005cu2131' t u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' p are the candidate features combined with the corresponding constraint conditions
p25
aVIn this section, we analyze the influences of employed feature sets and constraint conditions on the performances
p26
aVOnly Omni-word feature is bin sensitive
p27
aVPropose a novel Omni-word feature for Chinese relation extraction
p28
aVFour constraint conditions are proposed to generate combined features to capture the local dependency and maximize the classification determination
p29
aVIt is encoded by combining the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention information
p30
aVA position sensitive feature has a label indicating which entity mention it depends on
p31
aVThe Omni-word feature and soft constrain are proposed in Section 3
p32
aVThe soft constraints, proposed in this paper, are combined features like these syntactic or semantic constraints, which will be discussed in Section 3.2
p33
aVOn the other hand, the feature based method usually uses the combined feature to capture such structure information []
p34
aVExcept in Row 8 and Row 11, when two head nouns of entity pair were combined as semantic pair and when POS tag were combined with the entity type, the performances are decreased
p35
aVUtilizing the notion of combined feature [] , we replace the hard constraint by the soft constraint
p36
aVUnlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature
p37
aV[] employed a model, combining both the feature based and the tree kernel based methods
p38
aVIn consideration of the Chinese characteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features
p39
aVThose are generated by combining two entity types or two entity subtypes into a semantic pair
p40
aVIn this paper, for a better demonstration of the constraint condition, we still use the Position Sensitive as the default setting to use the Head noun and the adjacent entity POS tag
p41
aVIn our experiment, the entity type, subtype and the head noun are used
p42
aVBecause the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed
p43
aVIn our experiments, only the position feature is used as singleton feature
p44
aVBecause the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be generated
p45
aVThe entity mention is annotated with its full extent and its head , referred to as the extend mention and the head mention respectively
p46
aVSymbol u'\u005cu201c' / u'\u005cu201d' means that the corresponding candidate features in the referential feature set are substituted by the new constraint condition
p47
aVA feature is employed as a singleton feature when it is used without combining with any information
p48
aVFor every employed candidate feature, an appropriate constraint condition is selected to combine them with additional information to maximize the classification determination
p49
aVBy-Segmentation denotes the traditional segmentation based feature set generated by a segmentation tool, collecting every output of relation mention
p50
aVEntity Type and Subtype
p51
aVOmni-word feature with bins information can increase the performance considerably
p52
aVIn the open relation extraction domain, syntactic and semantic constraints are widely employed to prevent the u'\u005cu201c' semantic drift u'\u005cu201d' problem
p53
aVIn Section 3 , we introduced five candidate feature sets
p54
aVHead Noun
p55
aVPosition Sensitive
p56
aVA relation mention (or instance) is the embodiment of a relation
p57
aVThis means that, the missing of sentence structure information on the employed features can lead to a bad performance
p58
aVIn our model, we use only the adjacent entity POS tags, which lie in two sides of the entity mention
p59
aVIn the field of Chinese relation extraction, Liu et al
p60
aVRow 13 and 14 compare the Omni-word feature ( By-Omni-word ) with the traditional segmentation based feature ( By-Segmentation
p61
aVThe position structure between two entity mentions (extend mentions
p62
aVMost papers in relation extraction try to augment the number of employed features
p63
aVAiming at the Chinese inattentive structure, we utilize the soft constraint to capture the local dependency in a relation instance
p64
aVEntity-related information (e.g., head noun, entity type, subtype, CLASS, LDCTYPE, etc.) are supposed to be known and provided by the corpus
p65
aVTwo kinds of semantic pair are employed
p66
aVSemantic Pair
p67
aVSo, the traditional character-based or word-based feature is only a subset of the Omni-word feature
p68
aVBecause features may interact mutually in an indirect way, even with the same feature set, different constraint conditions can have significant influences on the final performance
p69
aVFor each of the remained sentences, we iteratively extract every entity mention pair as the arguments of relation instances for predicting
p70
aVComparing the reference set (5) with the reference set (3), the Head noun and adjacent entity POS tag get a better performance when used as singletons
p71
aVAn entity mention is a reference to an entity
p72
aVEspecially, when the bin information is used (Row 15), the performance of Omni-word feature increases considerably
p73
aVSemantic pair is generated by combining two semantic units
p74
aVIn short, from Table 4 we have seen that the entity type and subtype maximize the performance when used as semantic pair
p75
aVRow 14 shows that, compared with the traditional method, the Omni-word feature improves the performance by about 8.79% in 6 relation types and 11.83% in 18 subtypes in F-core
p76
aVVarious systems were proposed for Chinese relation extraction
p77
aVModel parameters are increased by the combined features
p78
aVEach soft constraint (combined feature) has a parameter trained by the classifier indicating the discrimination ability it has
p79
aVInternal character sequences are the four entity extend and head mentions
p80
aV[] explored the position feature between two entities
p81
aVThe structure information (or dependent information) of relation instance is critical for recognition
p82
aVSuccessful recognition of relation implies correctly detecting both the relation arguments and relation type
p83
aVN-Gram features are more fragmented
p84
aVIn order to give a better comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, based on our experiment settings and data, we implement the two feature based methods proposed by Che et al
p85
aVThis insures that the performances of the candidate features are optimized
p86
aV[] introduced a feature based method, which utilized lexicon information around entities and was evaluated on Winnow and SVM classifiers
p87
aV[] also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction
p88
aVTo extract the Omni-word feature, only a lexicon is required, then scan the sentence to collect every word
p89
aVPOS Tag
p90
aVAfter discarding the entity mention pairs that were used as positive instances, we generated 93,283 negative relation instances labelled as u'\u005cu201c' OTHER u'\u005cu201d'
p91
aVDespite the Omni-word can be seen as a subset of n-Gram feature
p92
aVIn this paper, we use the soft constraint to model the local dependency
p93
aVTherefore, the Owni-word feature with bin information can make a better use of both the syntactic information and the local dependency
p94
aV6 major relation types and the none relation (or negative instance
p95
aVThe entity type and subtype , head noun , position feature are referred to as u'\u005cu2131' t u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' p 8 8 u'\u005cu201c' thp u'\u005cu201d' is an acronym of u'\u005cu201c' t ype, h ead, p osition u'\u005cu201d'
p96
aV[] proposed a model handling the high dimensional feature space
p97
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' Person_Location u'\u005cu2019' denotes that the type of the first relation argument is a u'\u005cu201c' Person u'\u005cu201d' (entity type) and the second is a u'\u005cu201c' Location u'\u005cu201d' (entity type
p98
aVIn Table 3 , Ei ( i u'\u005cu2208' 1 , 2 ) represents entity mention u'\u005cu201c' Order u'\u005cu201d' in Che et al
p99
aVBoth of them are feature based methods
p100
aVBin Sensitive
p101
aVAll the employed features are simply classified into five categories
p102
aVZhang et al
p103
aVZhang et al
p104
aVThird, the entity mentions are manually annotated
p105
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó_E1 u'\u005cu2019' means that the head noun u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó u'\u005cu2019' depend on the first entity mention
p106
aVIn our work, we focus on the detection and recognition of relation mention
p107
aVTherefore, the Chinese relation extraction is more difficult
p108
aVThe Omni-word feature set is denoted by u'\u005cu2131' o u'\u005cu2062' w
p109
aV[] also showed that Path-enclosed Tree (PT) achieves the best performance in the kernel based relation extraction
p110
aVThe performance was reported on 7 relation types
p111
aV[] and Zhang et al
p112
aV[] and Zhang et al
p113
aVDeleting of relation instances is acceptable for open relation extraction because it always deals with a big data set
p114
aVIn this field, the tree kernel based method commonly uses the parse tree to capture the structure information []
p115
aVInstead of using them as independent features, we combined them with additional information
p116
aVBecause we are interested in the 6 annotated major relation types and the 18 subtypes, we average the results of five runs on the 6 positive relation types (and 18 subtypes) as the final performance
p117
aVIn most of the instances, the n-Gram features have no semantic meanings attached to them, thus have varied distributions
p118
aV[] experimented with different kernel methods and inferred that simply migrating from English kernel methods can result in a bad performance in Chinese relation extraction
p119
aVSegmentation of bins bears the sentence structure information
p120
aVThose sentences that do not contain any entity mention pair are deleted
p121
aVIn our study, Omni-word feature is not added as u'\u005cu201c' bag of words u'\u005cu201d'
p122
aVOn the other hand, the Omni-word can avoid these problems and take advantages of Chinese characteristics (the word-formation and the ambiguity of word segmentation
p123
aV{CJK} UTF8gbsn For example, relation mention u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞ÂåóÂ§ßÂÆâÊ£ÆÊûóÂÖ¨Âõ≠ u'\u005cu2019' (Taipei Daan Forest Park) has a u'\u005cu201d' PART-WHOLE u'\u005cu201d' relation type
p124
aVA maximum entropy multi-class classifier is trained and tested on the generated relation instances
p125
aVThe Owni-word feature, utilizing every possible word in them, is a better way to capture more information
p126
aVThe first lexicon is obtained by segmenting every relation instance using the ICTCLAS package, collecting very word produced by ICTCLAS
p127
aVThere are two paradigms extracting the relationship between two entities the Open Relation Extraction (ORE) and the Traditional Relation Extraction (TRE) []
p128
aVChinese relation extraction also faces a weak performance having F-score about 66.6% in 18 subtypes []
p129
aVThe extent mention includes both the head and its modifiers
p130
aVIt is not the same as the n-Gram feature
p131
aVLi and Zhang et al
p132
aVDespite the popularity of kernel based method, Huang et al
p133
aV[] is a kernel based method evaluated on the ACE 2005 corpus
p134
aVIn ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus, there are 7 entity types (Person, Organization, GPE, Location, Facility, Weapon and Vehicle) and 44 subtypes (e.g., Group, Government, Continent, etc
p135
aVChe et al
p136
aVChe et al
p137
aVFor example, suppose a sentence has three entity mentions
p138
aVIn Row 4, 10 and 13, these features are used as singleton , the performance degrades considerably
p139
aVThe traditional segmentation method may generate four lexical features { u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' Â§ßÂÆâ u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' Ê£ÆÊûó u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' ÂÖ¨Âõ≠ u'\u005cu2019' }, which is a partition of the relation mention
p140
aVCombining two head nouns may increase the feature space by 7356 ◊ ( 7356 - 1
p141
aVIn Row 1, because u'\u005cu2131' t u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' p are features directly obtained from annotated corpus, we take this performance as our referential performance
p142
aVThis feature is useful and widely used
p143
aVSuch a large feature space makes the occurrence of features close to a random distribution, leading to a worse data sparseness
p144
aVThe results show that u'\u005cu2131' o u'\u005cu2062' w is effective for Chinese relation extraction
p145
aVWe use the ACE 2005 RDC Chinese corpus, which was collected from newswires, broadcasts and weblogs, containing 633 documents with 6 major relation types and 18 subtypes
p146
aVMost of the researches make use of the combined feature, but rarely analyze the influence of the approaches we combine them
p147
aVMost of these features are nested or overlapped mutually
p148
aVRow 13 and 14 show that the Omni-word method outperforms the traditional method
p149
aVFader et al
p150
aVBecause high precision can be received by using simple lexical features []
p151
aVLacking of orthographic word makes Chinese word segmentation difficult

p153
aVIn the ACE corpus, an entity is an object or set of objects in the world
p154
aVLiu et al
p155
aVAnd Carlson et al
p156
aVBecause the ICTCLAS package was trained on annotated corpus containing many meaningful lexicon entries
p157
aVThen, we have 7 relation types and 19 subtypes
p158
aVEach relation has two entities as arguments
p159
aVModern Chinese Dictionary http://www.cp.com.cn/ , when the corpus becoming larger, the n-Gram (nø4) method is difficult to be adopted
p160
aVThe performance of relation extraction is still unsatisfactory with a F-score of 67.5% for English (23 subtypes) []
p161
aVCombining with external semantic resources, a better performance was achieved
p162
aVThe first observation is that the combined features are more powerful than used as singletons
p163
aVThey will be used as three independent features
p164
aVBoth approaches are based on the Chinese characteristics
p165
aVThe five-fold cross validation was used and declared the performances on 6 relation types and 18 subtypes
p166
aV[] proposed a convolution tree kernel
p167
aVAgichtein, Carlson and Fader et al
p168
aVRelation identification is handled as a classification problem
p169
aVFirst, the specificity of Chinese word-formation indicates that the subphrases of Chinese word (or phrase) are also informative
p170
aVFour types of order are employed (the same as ours
p171
aVIn the following, we introduce the feature construction, which discusses the proposed two approaches
p172
aVThe superiorities of Owni-word feature depend on three reasons
p173
aVThese results reflect the interactions between different features
p174
aV[] filters candidate instances and patterns using the number of times they co-occurs
p175
aVIn Chinese, a single sentence often has several segmentation paths leading to the segmentation ambiguity problem []
p176
aVWe give the experimental results in Section 3.2 and analyze the performance in Section 4
p177
aVBased on Deep Belief Network , Chen et al
p178
aVThere are 8,023 relations and 9,317 relation mentions
p179
aVPlease refer to Zhang et al
p180
aVIt is referred by the sentence (or clause) in which the relation is located in
p181
aVIn this paper, we generate the lexicon by merging two lexicons
p182
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó_Bin_F u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó_Bin_E1 u'\u005cu2019' and u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó_Bin_E u'\u005cu2019' mean that the lexicon entry u'\u005cu2018' Âè∞Âåó u'\u005cu2019' appears in three bins the FIRST bin, the first entity mention (E1) bin and the END bin
p183
aVAccording to our survey, compared to the same work in English, the Chinese relation extraction researches make less significant progress
p184
aVInstead of the 4 position structures, the 9 position structures are used
p185
aVIn Row 2, the u'\u005cu201c' Uni-Gram u'\u005cu201d' represents the Uni-gram features of internal and external character sequences
p186
aVThe notion of u'\u005cu201c' word u'\u005cu201d' in Chinese is vague and has never played a role in the Chinese philological tradition []
p187
aVThe POS tags are not used independently
p188
aVFurthermore, for a single Chinese word, occurrences of 4 characters are frequent
p189
aVThe last one is proposed in this paper and is discussed in detail
p190
aVChen and Li et al
p191
aVWe expect this lexicon to improve the performance
p192
aVIn Table 3 , it is shown that our system outperforms other systems, in F-score, by 10% on 6 relation types and by 15% on 18 subtypes
p193
aV[] propose syntactic and semantic constraints to prevent this deficiency
p194
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' Bi-Gram u'\u005cu201d' is the 2-gram feature of internal and external character sequences
p195
aVZhou et al
p196
aVThey can precisely segment the relation instance into corresponding bins
p197
aVTo implement the maximum entropy model, the toolkit provided by Le [] is employed
p198
aVSuch constraints can also be seen as structural constraint
p199
aVAny relation instance violating these constraints (or below a predefined threshold) will be abandoned
p200
aVIn our experiment, we found that this does not always guarantee the best performance, despite the classifier being adopted is claimed to control these features independently
p201
aVEven strict filtrations or constrains are employed to filter the redundancy information, they often generate tens of thousands of relations dynamically []
p202
aVSome Chinese segmentation performance has been reported precision scores above 95% []
p203
aVHence, the local dependency contexts around the relation arguments are more helpful []
p204
aVIn Row 2, with only the u'\u005cu2131' o u'\u005cu2062' w feature, the F-score already reaches 77.74% in 6 types and 60.31% in 18 subtypes
p205
aVThere are 7356 head nouns in the training set
p206
aVThese POS tags are labelled by the ICTCLAS package 2 2 http://ictclas.org/
p207
aVThe practicability of ORE systems depends on the adequateness of information in a big corpus []
p208
aVTable 1 gives the performance of our system on the 6 types and 18 subtypes
p209
aVFor example u'\u005cu2018' E1_Right_n u'\u005cu2019' means that the right side of the first entity is a noun ( u'\u005cu201c' n u'\u005cu201d'
p210
aVBecause Chinese has plenty of characters 5 5 Currently, at least 13000 characters are used by native Chinese people
p211
aVSecond, most of relation instances have limited context
p212
aVThe second lexicon is the Lexicon Common Words in Contemporary Chinese 4 4 Published by Ministry of Education of the People u'\u005cu2019' s Republic of China in 2008, containing 56,008 entries
p213
aVThe TRE paradigm takes hand-tagged examples as input, extracting predefined relation types []
p214
aVWe mainly focus on systems trained and tested on the ACE corpus
p215
aVWe apply these approaches in a maximum entropy based system to extract relations from the ACE 2005 corpus
p216
aVInformation Extraction (IE) aims at extracting syntactic or semantic units with concrete concepts or linguistic functions []
p217
aVBut it u'\u005cu2019' s not suitable for traditional relation extraction, and will result in a low recall
p218
aVIncreasing of parameters projects the relation extraction problem into a higher dimensional space, making the decision boundaries become more flexible
p219
aVThe word-formation of Chinese also implies that the meanings of a compound word are made up, usually, by the meanings of words that contained in it []
p220
aVFor each type of these relations, a SVM was trained and tested independently
p221
aVFor example, Lin et al
p222
aVCurrently, the state-of-the-art Chinese OOV recognition system has performance about 75% in recall []
p223
aVSuch improvement may reside in the three reasons discussed in Section 3.3
p224
aVTogether with the two entity mentions, we get five parts u'\u005cu201c' FIRST u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' MIDDLE u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' END u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' E1 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' E2 u'\u005cu201d' (or less, if the two entity mentions are nested
p225
aVThe named entities in the ACE corpus are also annotated with the CLASS and LDCTYPE labels
p226
aVCompared to the ORE systems, the TRE systems have a robust performance
p227
aVThe relation recognition task is to find the relationships between two entities
p228
aVHowever, when iteratively coping with large heterogeneous data, the ORE systems suffer from the u'\u005cu201c' semantic drift u'\u005cu201d' problem, caused by error accumulation []
p229
aVThese problems are worsened by the fact that Chinese has a large number of characters and words
p230
aV[] for the details of these 9 position structures
p231
aV[] was based on the ACE 2005 corpus with 75% data for training and 25% for testing
p232
aVHowever, for the same sentence, even native peoples in China often disagree on word boundaries []
p233
aV[] has showed that there is a consistence of 75% on the segmentation among different native Chinese speakers
p234
aVThe POS tags are referred to as u'\u005cu2131' p u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' s
p235
aVNo subjective or priori judgement is adopted to delete any potential determinative constraint (except for the reason of dimensionality reduction
p236
aVThe reason of the tree kernel based approach not achieve the same level of accuracy as that from English may be that segmenting and parsing Chinese are more difficult and less accurate than processing English

p239
aVOur model (in Section 3.3 ) uses these settings
p240
aVDisadvantages of the TRE systems are that the manually annotated corpus is required, which is time-consuming and costly in human labor
p241
aVHowever, even in English, u'\u005cu201c' deeper u'\u005cu201d' analysis (e.g., logical syntactic relations or predicate-argument structure) may suffer from a worse performance caused by inaccurate chunking or parsing

p243
aVThe difficulty of Chinese IE is that Chinese words are written next to each other without delimiter in between
p244
aVMaking better use of such information is beneficial
p245
aVMost of these constraints are hard constraints
p246
aVInstead of dealing with the whole documents, focusing on designated information, most of the IE systems extract named entities, relations, quantifiers or events from sentences
