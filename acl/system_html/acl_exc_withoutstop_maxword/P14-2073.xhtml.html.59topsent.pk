VThen, for each dataset, for rejuvenation disabled, rejuvenation based on a reservoir of size 1000, and rejuvenation based on the entire history (in turn), we perform 30 runs of the particle filter from that fixed initial model

aVIn the experiments of Börschinger and Johnson ( 2012 ) , the particle cloud appears to be resampled once per utterance with a large rejuvenation sequence; 4 4 The ESS threshold is P ; the rejuvenation sequence is 100 or 1600 utterances, almost one sixth of the training data each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler

aVThus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter u'\u005cu2019' s initial model to the model out of these 20 with
