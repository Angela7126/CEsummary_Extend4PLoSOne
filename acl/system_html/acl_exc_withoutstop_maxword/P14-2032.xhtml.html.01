<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Similar to previous work [ 13 ] , we solve this DD problem by iteratively updating the sub-gradient as depicted in Algorithm 2.2</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time</a>
