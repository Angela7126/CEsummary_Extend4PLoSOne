<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We can incorporate the proposed constraints (constraints derived from lexical patterns and discourse connectives) as hard constraints into CRF during inference by manually setting u'\u039b' in equation 4 to a large value, 9 9 We set u'\u039b' to 1000 for the lexical constraints and -1000 to the discourse connective constraints in the experiments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences</a>
