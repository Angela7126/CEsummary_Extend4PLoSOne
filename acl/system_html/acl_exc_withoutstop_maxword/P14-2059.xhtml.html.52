<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our ultimate goal is matching claims and comparing methods, which would likely benefit from an analysis of the full contents of the document and not just previous citations of it, so in future work we also intend to use the context from the successful external results as training data for a summarisation stage</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We expect this will allow us to identify claims made in a draft paper and match them with related claims made in other papers for support or contrast, and so offer answers in the form of relevant passages extracted from the suggested documents</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This can be captured as a set of relevance judgements for candidate citations over a corpus of documents, which is an arduous effort that requires considerable manual input and very careful preparation</a>
