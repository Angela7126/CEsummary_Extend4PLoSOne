VWe use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) update summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set
p1
aVWords with - 2 u'\u005cu2062' log u'\u005cu2061' u'\u005cu039b' 10 are considered topic words u'\u005cu2019' s system gives a weight of 1 to the topic words and scores sentences using the number of topic words normalized by sentence length
p2
aVIn this generic task, some of the best reported results were obtained by a system [] which computed importance scores for words in the input by examining if the word occurs with significantly higher probability in the input compared to a large background collection of news articles
p3
aVCentral to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher
