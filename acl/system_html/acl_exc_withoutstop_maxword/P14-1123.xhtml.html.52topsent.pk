VThese high error rates at the recognition stage negatively affect the subsequent stages of the speech scoring system in general, and in particular, during a deep syntactic analysis, which operates on a long sequence of words as its context
p1
aVBased on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level
p2
aVChen and Zechner ( 2011 ) found that while using measures of syntactic complexity obtained from transcriptions, errors in ASR transcripts caused over 0.40 drop in correlation from that found with manual transcriptions 5 5 Due to differences in the dataset and ASR system, a direct comparison between the current study and the cited prior study was not possible

aVSimilarly, Scarborough ( 1990 ) proposed the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), according to which, the presence of particular grammatical structures, from a list of 60 structures
