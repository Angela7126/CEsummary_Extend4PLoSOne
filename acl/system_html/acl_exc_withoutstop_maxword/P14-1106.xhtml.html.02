<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The popular distortion or lexicalized reordering models in phrase-based SMT make good local predictions by focusing on reordering on word level, while the synchronous context free grammars in hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) translation models are capable of handling non-local reordering on the translation phrase level</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our syntactic constituent reordering model considers context free grammar (CFG) rules in the source language and predicts the reordering of their elements on the target side, using word alignment information</a>
