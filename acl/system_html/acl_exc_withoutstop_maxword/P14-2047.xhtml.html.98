<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Once 1-many segments are identified, source-side text simplification techniques may be developed [ 17 ] to improve translation quality</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes a source sentence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We find however that no strong relationship exists between the two, as shown by the correlation coefficients between HTER values and the number of words in each segment in Table 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality</a>
