<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To do so, we contrast different MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse information</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As an example, consider the three discourse trees (DTs) shown in Figure 4 a ) for a reference (human) translation, and ( b ) and ( c ) for translations of two different systems on the WMT12 test dataset</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, at WMT12, 12 metrics were compared [] , most of them new</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Furthermore, when combined with individual metrics in group II, DR- lex is able to improve consistently over each one of them</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These metrics tasks are based on sentence-level evaluation, which arguably can limit the benefits of using global discourse properties</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, we can conclude that at the system-level, adding discourse information to a metric, even using the simplest of the combination schemes, is a good idea for most of the metrics, and can help to significantly improve the correlation with human judgments</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individually, DR- lex outperforms most of the metrics from group II, and ranks as the second best metric in that group</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Again, DR- lex is better than DR; with a positive Tau of +.133, yet as an individual metric, it ranks poorly compared to other metrics in group II</a>
