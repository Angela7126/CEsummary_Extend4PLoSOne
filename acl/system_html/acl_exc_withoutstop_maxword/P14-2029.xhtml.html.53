<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the u'\u2113' 2 -regularized linear regression model with an u'\u2113' 2 -regularized logistic regression and used Kendall u'\u2019' s u'\u03a4' rank correlation between the predicted probabilities of the positive class and the binary</a>
