<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To shed more light on specific strengths and weaknesses of our approach, we performed a manual error analysis of scope predictions by Crawler, starting from gold cues so as to focus in-depth analysis on properties specific to scope resolution over MRSs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A semantically empty word is determined to be in-scope if there is an in-scope syntax tree node in the right position relative to it, as governed by a short list of templates organized by the type of the semantically empty word (particles, complementizers, non-referential pronouns, relative pronouns, and auxiliary verbs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This work grew out of a discussion with colleagues of the Language Technology Group at the University of Oslo, notably Elisabeth Lien and Jan Tore L nning, to whom we are indebted for stimulating cooperation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Scopal information in MRS analyses delivered by the ERG fixes the scope of operators u'\u2014' such as negation, modals, scopal adverbs (including subordinating conjunctions like while ), and clause-embedding verbs (e.g., believe ) u'\u2014' based on their position in the constituent structure, while leaving the scope of quantifiers (e.g., a or every , but also other determiners) free</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Both approaches attempted to handle discontinuous instances by applying two heuristics to the predicted scope a) removing preceding conjuncts from the scope when the cue is in a conjoined phrase and (b) removing sentential adverbs from</a>
