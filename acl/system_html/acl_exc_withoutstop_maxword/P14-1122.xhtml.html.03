<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To compare with the video games, items were annotated using two additional methods crowdsourcing and a non-video game with a purpose</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When annotations on items in N are included for both games and crowdsourcing, the costs per annotation drop to comparable levels</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Annotation Aggregation In each game, an item is annotated when players make a binary choice as to whether the item u'\u2019' s relation is true (e.g.,, whether an image is related to a concept</a>
