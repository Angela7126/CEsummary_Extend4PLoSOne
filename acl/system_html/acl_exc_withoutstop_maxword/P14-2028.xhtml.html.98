<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For this purpose we used a method based on the simulated annealing algorithm</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Basic building block of every mentioned algorithm is one-step noisy-channel correction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also note, that the method works only because multiple misspellings of the same word are presented in our model; for related research see [ 2 ]</a>
