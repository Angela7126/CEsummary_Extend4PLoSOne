<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We modified word2vec to support arbitrary contexts, and to output the context embeddings in addition to the word embeddings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This dataset contains pairs of similar words that reflect either relatedness (topical similarity) or similarity (functional similarity) relations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To demonstrate, we list the 5 most activated contexts for our example words with Deps embeddings in Table 2</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Previous work on neural word embeddings take the contexts of a word to be its linear context u'\u2013' words that precede and follow the target word, typically in a window of k tokens to each side</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, other target words show clear differences between embeddings</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Intuitively, words that appear in similar contexts should have similar embeddings,</a>
