<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We also present a novel technique for training the neural network to be self-normalized , which avoids the costly step of posteriorizing over the entire vocabulary in decoding</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, we have demonstrated that we can obtain 50%-80% of the total improvement with only one model (S2T/L2R NNJM), and 70%-90% with only two models (S2T/L2R NNJM + S2T NNLTM</a>
