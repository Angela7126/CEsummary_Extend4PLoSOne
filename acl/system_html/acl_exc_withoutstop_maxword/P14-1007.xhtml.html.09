<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In terms of our operations defined over semantic representations, this is rendered as follows all arguments of the negated verb are selected by argument crawling , all intersective modifiers by label crawling , and functor crawling (Fig</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our MRS crawling algorithm is sketched in Fig</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The negation cue for a negated nominal argument will appear as a quantifier EP in the MRS, triggering line 3 of our algorithm</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Scopal information in MRS analyses delivered by the ERG fixes the scope of operators u'\u2014' such as negation, modals, scopal adverbs (including subordinating conjunctions like while ), and clause-embedding verbs (e.g., believe ) u'\u2014' based on their position in the constituent structure, while leaving the scope of quantifiers (e.g., a or every , but also other determiners) free</a>
