<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To create the pool of pairs for labeling, we randomly sampled 1000 pairs and then removed pairs that we thought were processing errors</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On this subset of pairs, Fleiss u'\u2019' Kappa is 0.322, and 74.4% of pairs were strength changes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Participants were then asked to choose labels and write mandatory comments for 50 pairs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The instructions included 8 pairs as examples and 10 pairs to label as a training exercise</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We required pairs to have similarity score larger than 0.5 in our labeling task to make pairs more comparable</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this section, we describe how we tried to define strength differences, compiled labeling instructions, and gathered labels using Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We collected 9 labels each for 500 pairs</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In order to study statement strength, reliable strength-difference labels are needed</a>
