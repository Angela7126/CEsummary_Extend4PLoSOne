VThen, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs
p1
aVTo output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb
p2
aVTo do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses
p3
aVOur method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames
p4
aVThis is because an initial frame has the same structure as a semantic frame, which is produced by merging initial frames
p5
aVIn this paper, we propose a two-step approach for inducing semantic frames and verb classes
p6
aVBased on the best results in the above evaluations, we induced semantic frames using slot-word pair features, and then induced verb classes using slot-only features
p7
aVWe first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al
p8
aVWe regard each output cluster as a semantic frame, by merging the initial frames in a cluster into a semantic frame
p9
aVWe evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al
p10
aVSince we focus on the handling of verb polysemy, predominant class induction for each verb is not our main objective
p11
aVWe speculate that slot distributions are not so different among verbs when all uses of a verb are merged into one frame, and thus their discrimination power is lower than that in the intermediate construction of semantic frames
p12
aVFor instance, u'\u005cu201c' Class 2 u'\u005cu201d' consists of the semantic frames u'\u005cu201c' need:2 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' say:2 u'\u005cu201d' These frames were merged due to the high syntactic similarity of constituting slot distributions, which are comprised of a subject and a sentential complement
p13
aVAlthough Bayesian approaches are a possible solution to simultaneously induce frames and verb classes from a corpus as used in previous studies, it has prohibitive computational cost
p14
aVinduce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1

aV9 9 Since FrameNet frames are not assigned to all verbs of SemLink, the number of verbs is different from the evaluations against VerbNet classes
p16
aV2003 ) , prepositional phrases (pp) are parameterized for two frequent subcategorization frames (NP and NP_PP), and the unfiltered raw frequencies of subcategorization frames are used as features to represent a verb
p17
aVThis result is consistent with expectations, given a gold standard based on Levin u'\u005cu2019' s verb classes, which are organized according to the syntactic behavior of verbs
p18
aVIn this paper, we propose an unsupervised method for inducing verb classes that is aware of verb polysemy
p19
aVWe can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb
p20
aVBy taking this step-wise approach, we can not only induce verb classes with frequency information from a massive amount of verb uses in a scalable manner, but also deal with verb polysemy
p21
aVFrom the result, we can see that the induced verb classes based on slot-only features did not achieve a higher F 1 than those based on slot-word pair features in many cases
p22
aVWe induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al
p23
aVWe select an argument in the following order by considering the degree of effect on the verb sense

p26
aVInterestingly, this result indicates that slot distributions are more effective than lexical information in slot-word pairs for inducing verb classes similar to the gold standard
p27
aV2003 ) evaluated hard clusterings based on a gold standard with multiple classes per verb
p28
aVSince they focused on the incorporation of selectional preferences, they did not evaluate verb classes but evaluated only selectional preferences using a language model-based measure
p29
aVIt is not necessary to normalize these metrics because the clustering of these instances is hard

aVWe regard each output cluster as a verb class this time

aV2003 ) , using the gold standard with multiple classes, which we also use for our multi-class evaluations
p33
aVHowever, since these measures are only applicable to a hard clustering, it is necessary to extend them to be applicable to a soft clustering, because in our task a verb can belong to multiple clusters or classes
p34
aVinduce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering predicate-argument structures for each verb extracted from automatic parses as shown in the lower part of Figure 1 , and
p35
aVVerb classes are one such lexical resource
p36
aVHe applied this method to the BNC and acquired 1,200 frames and 400 roles [ 21 ]
p37
aVLapata and Brew ( 2004 ) and Li and Brew ( 2007 ) proposed probabilistic models for calculating prior probabilities of verb classes for a verb
p38
aVParisien and Stevenson ( 2011 ) extended their model by adding semantic features
p39
aV2012 ) extended the model of Titov and Klementiev ( 2012 ) , which is an unsupervised model for inducing semantic roles, to jointly induce semantic roles and frames across verbs using the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ]
p40
aVWe can see that u'\u005cu201c' web/SW-S u'\u005cu201d' achieved the best performance and obtained a higher F 1 than the baselines by more than nine points u'\u005cu201c' Web/SW-S u'\u005cu201d' uses the combination of slot-word pair features for clustering verb-specific frames and slot-only features for clustering across verbs
p41
aVWhen we evaluate against the multiple classes in the gold standard, we do normalize the inverse purity
p42
aVAfter performing soft clustering, they noted that most verbs fell into a single class, and they decided to assign a single class to each verb by hardening the clustering
p43
aVFirst, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point [ 14 , 23 ]
p44
aV2008 ) also applied probabilistic soft clustering to verbs by incorporating subcategorization frames and selectional preferences based on WordNet
p45
aVHowever, the verb itself is still represented as a single data point
p46
aVFinally, we use the harmonic mean (F 1 ) of nmPU and niPU as a single measure of clustering quality
p47
aVIn particular, they tried to consider verb polysemy by using the IB method, which is a soft clustering method [ 43 ]
p48
aVThe other representation using the slot-word pairs means that semantic similarity based on word overlap is naturally considered by looking at lexical information
p49
aVmerge the predicate-argument structures that have presumably the same meaning based on the assumption of one sense per collocation [ 46 ] to get a set of initial frames, and
p50
aVThese models are approximated to condition not on verbs but on subcategorization frames
p51
aVThe original method in Kawahara et al
p52
aVAs we did with the multi-class evaluations, we adopt modified purity (mPU), inverse purity (iPU) and their harmonic mean (F 1 ) as the metrics for the evaluation with predominant classes
p53
aVThis model is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and the Minimum Description Length principle
p54
aVThese two levels of evaluations are performed by considering the work of Reichart et al
p55
aVTo prepare a web corpus, we extracted sentences from crawled web pages that are judged to be written in English based on the encoding information
p56
aVIt is not necessary to normalize these metrics when we treat verbs as monosemous, and evaluate against the predominant sense
p57
aVAs mentioned in Li and Brew ( 2007 ) , it is desirable to extend the model to depend on verbs to further improve accuracy
p58
aVCapturing the sense of a verb is essential for natural language processing (NLP), and thus lexical resources for verbs play an important role in NLP
p59
aVFor the features, w , in equation ( 2 ), we try the two representations again slot-only features and slot-word pair features
p60
aVP ( f i c j ) is defined based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution as follows
p61
aV2009 ) proposed a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM; Neal ( 2000 ) ) to cluster verbs based on subcategorization frame distributions
p62
aVAs usual, the following normalized inverse purity (niPU) is used to measure the recall of a clustering
p63
aVIt is necessary to specify the number of clusters, k , for the IB method beforehand, and we adopt 35 and 42 clusters according to their reported high accuracies
p64
aVIn addition, to penalize clusters that consist of only one verb, such singleton clusters in K are considered as errors, as is usual with modified purity
p65
aVHe used a model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA; Blei et al
p66
aV3 3 If a predicate-argument structure has multiple prepositional phrases, one of them is randomly selected
p67
aVBoth of these are represented as a probabilistic distribution of words across verbs

aVAn excerpt from this data is shown in Table 1
p69
aVK i denotes the number of positive components in K i , and c i u'\u005cu2062' v denotes the v -th component of K i u'\u005cu0394' K i u'\u005cu2062' ( K i u'\u005cu2229' G j ) means the total mass of the set of verbs in K i u'\u005cu2229' G j , given by summing up the values in K i
p70
aVThis monosemous assumption, however, is not realistic because many frequent verbs actually have multiple senses

aV2014 ) defined w as pairs of slots and words, e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' nsubj:child u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' dobj:bird, u'\u005cu201d' but does not consider slot-only features, e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' nsubj u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' dobj, u'\u005cu201d' which ignore lexical information

p74
aVNote that our results of the NN and IB methods are different from those reported in their paper since the data source is different
p75
aVThe normalized modified purity (nmPU) can then be written as follows
p76
aVAs our baselines, we adopt two previously proposed methods
p77
aVThe results of these methods are obtained by averaging five runs

aVThe results of the IB baseline and our methods are obtained by averaging five runs

aVTo induce verb classes across verbs, we apply clustering to the induced verb-specific semantic frames
p80
aVinduce both semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses by a scalable method
p81
aVWe ended with 38,481 semantic frames and 699 verb classes from the Gigaword corpus, and 61,903 semantic frames and 840 verb classes from the web corpus
p82
aVWe first implemented a soft clustering method for verb class induction proposed by Korhonen et al
p83
aVMaterna applied an LDA-based method to the BNC, which contains 1.4M verb uses, to induce semantic frames across verbs that can be considered to be verb classes [ 21 , 22 ]
p84
aV2003 ) ) and the Dirichlet process to cluster verb instances of a triple (subject, verb, object) to produce semantic frames and roles
p85
aVOur objective is to automatically learn semantic frames and verb classes from a massive amount of verb uses following usage-based approaches
p86
aVHe did not evaluate the resulting frames as verb classes
p87
aVThey conducted several evaluations including predominant class induction and token-level verb sense disambiguation, but did not evaluate multiple classes output by their models
p88
aVTo output multiple classes for each verb, we set a threshold, t , for class attribute probabilities
p89
aVFor a baseline, we use verb-specific semantic frames without clustering across verbs ( u'\u005cu201c' S-NIL u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' SW-NIL u'\u005cu201d' ), where these frames are considered to be verb classes but not shared across verbs
p90
aVExamples of verb classes and semantic frames induced from the web corpus are shown in Table 5 and Table 6
p91
aVFor instance, Parisien and Stevenson applied HDP only to a small-scale child speech corpus that contains 170K verb uses to jointly induce subcategorization frames and verb classes [ 26 , 27 ]
p92
aVWe cluster initial frames for each verb to produce semantic frames using the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ] , regarding each initial frame as an instance
p93
aVWe finally induce verb classes from the semantic frames of 1,667 verbs, which appear at least once in sections 02-21 of the WSJ corpus
p94
aVThen, we apply clustering to these frames across verbs
p95
aVThen, we compare the induced verb classes of the SemLink instances with their gold-standard VerbNet classes
p96
aVquantitatively evaluate a soft clustering of verbs
p97
aVThe average number of verb classes per verb is 2.24
p98
aVIn this way, semantic frames for each verb are acquired
p99
aVOur procedure to automatically induce verb classes from verb uses is summarized as follows
p100
aVWe also evaluate our induced verb classes on this gold-standard data, which was created on the basis of Levin u'\u005cu2019' s classes [ 16 ]
p101
aVThey used the information bottleneck (IB) method for assigning probabilities of classes to each verb
p102
aVManually-crafted verb classes have been developed, such as Levin u'\u005cu2019' s classes [ 16 ] and their extension, VerbNet [ 12 ] , in which verbs are organized into classes on the basis of their syntactic and semantic behavior
p103
aVLDA-frames are probabilistic semantic frames automatically induced from a raw corpus
p104
aVTo measure the precision and recall of a clustering, modified purity and inverse purity (also called collocation or weighted class accuracy) are commonly used in previous studies on verb clustering (e.g.,, Sun and Korhonen ( 2009 )
p105
aVThat is, classes that have a higher class attribute probability than the threshold are output for each verb
p106
aVThey tried to account for verb learning by children and did not evaluate the resultant verb classes
p107
aVThe use of slot-word pairs for verb class induction generally merged too many frames into each class, apparently due to accidental word overlaps across verbs
p108
aVAll of the above methods considered verbs to be monosemous and did not deal with verb polysemy
p109
aV2003 ) , who used distributions of subcategorization frames to cluster verbs
p110
aVWe first describe our experimental settings and define evaluation metrics to evaluate induced soft clusterings of verb classes
p111
aVAmong these studies on monosemous verb clustering (i.e.,, predominant class induction), there have been several Bayesian methods
p112
aVAs a representation for a data point, distributions of subcategorization frames are often used, and other semantic features (e.g.,, selectional preferences) are sometimes added to improve the performance
p113
aVAs stated in Section 1 , most of the previous studies on verb clustering assume that verbs are monosemous
p114
aVIn sum, there have been no studies that quantitatively evaluate polysemous verb classes automatically induced by unsupervised methods
p115
aVTheir method represents a verb u'\u005cu2019' s syntactic and semantic features, and learns a log-linear model from the SemLink corpus [ 20 ]
p116
aV2012 ) induced semantic frames across verbs using the monosemous assumption and reported an F 1 of 44.7% (77.9% PU and 31.4% iPU) for the assignment of FrameNet frames to the FrameNet corpus
p117
aVMore sophisticated methods for predominant class induction, such as the method of Sun and Korhonen ( 2009 ) using selectional preferences, could produce better single-class outputs, but have difficulty in producing polysemy-aware verb classes
p118
aVHowever, we wish to compare our method with previous work on the induction of a predominant (monosemous) class for each verb
p119
aVThere have also been many attempts to automatically acquire verb classes with the goal of either adding frequency information to an existing resource or of inducing similar verb classes for other languages
p120
aVThese initial frames are the input of the subsequent clustering process
p121
aVTo improve the quality of verb classes, it is necessary to develop a clustering model that can consider syntactic and lexical similarity in a balanced way
p122
aVA typical method in these studies is to represent each verb as a single data point and apply classification (e.g.,, Joanis et al
p123
aVThe procedure for inducing these semantic frames is as follows
p124
aVThe verb classes induced from the web corpus achieved a higher F 1 than those from the Gigaword corpus
p125
aVThey considered multiple classes only in the gold-standard data used for their evaluations
p126
aV2003 ) reported that the highest modified purity was 49% against predominant classes and 60% against multiple classes

aVFor baselines, we once more adopt the Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Information Bottleneck (IB) methods proposed by Korhonen et al

aV2012 ) , but our induced verb classes seem to have higher F 1 accuracy
p129
aVIt consists of 62 classes and 110 verbs, out of which 35 verbs are monosemous and 75 verbs are polysemous
p130
aVThe most closely related work to our polysemy-aware task of unsupervised verb class induction is the work of Korhonen et al
p131
aVThis data contains 110 verbs and 33 classes
p132
aVThey evaluated their result with a gold-standard test set, where a single class is assigned to a verb
p133
aVMaterna proposed LDA-frames, which are defined across verbs and can be considered to be a kind of verb class [ 21 , 22 ]
p134

aVexplicitly deal with verb polysemy
p136
aVOur approach also uses Bayesian methods, but is designed to capture verb polysemy
p137
aVOur proposed method using the web corpus achieved comparable performance with the baseline methods on the predominant class evaluation and outperformed them on the multiple class evaluation
p138
aVTo harden the clusterings of the IB method and the LDA-frames, the class with the highest probability is selected for each verb
p139
aVFor each predicate-argument structure of a verb, we couple the verb and an argument to make a unit for sense disambiguation
p140
aVThey adopted the Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Information Bottleneck (IB) methods for clustering
p141
aVWhere there is no frequency information available for class distribution, such as the gold-standard data described in Section 4.3 , we use a uniform distribution across the verb u'\u005cu2019' s classes
p142
aVSuppose K is the set of automatically induced clusters and G is the set of gold classes
p143
aVIt took two days to induce verb classes from the Gigaword corpus and three days from the web corpus
p144
aVMoreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of the following approaches attempt to quantitatively evaluate soft clusterings of verb classes induced by polysemy-aware unsupervised approaches [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 31 ]
p145
aVFor clustering features, we again compare two representations slot-only features (S) and slot-word pair features (SW
p146
aVMiyao and Tsujii ( 2009 ) proposed a supervised method that can handle verb polysemy
p147
aVWe propose a normalized version of modified purity and inverse purity
p148
aVWe also conducted the above evaluation against FrameNet frames for 75 verbs
p149
aVTo measure the precision of a clustering, a normalized version of modified purity is defined as follows
p150
aVOur semantic frames consist of case slots, each of which consists of word instances that can be filled
p151
aVParisien and Stevenson ( 2010 ) proposed a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP; Teh et al
p152
aVEach instance of these 119 verbs in this corpus belongs to one of 102 VerbNet classes
p153
aVwhere N is the number of initial frames for the target verb and n u'\u005cu2062' ( c j ) is the current number of initial frames assigned to the cluster c j u'\u005cu0391' is a hyper-parameter that determines how likely it is for a new cluster to be created
p154
aVThese 119 verbs cover 102 VerbNet classes, and 48 of them are polysemous in the sense of being in more than one VerbNet class
p155
aVdiscover effective features for each of the clustering steps, and
p156
aVPredicate-argument structures are collected for each verb and the subsequent processes are applied to the predicate-argument structures of each verb
p157
aVWe report the values of modified purity (mPU), inverse purity (iPU) and their harmonic mean (F 1
p158
aVSuch verb classes have been used in many NLP applications that need to consider semantics in particular, such as word sense disambiguation [ 4 ] , semantic parsing [ 41 , 33 ] and discourse parsing [ 37 ]
p159
aVLet K i be the verb vector of the i -th cluster and G j be the verb vector of the j -th gold class
p160
aVThen, the predicate-argument structures that have the same verb and argument pair (slot and word, e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' dobj:effect u'\u005cu201d' ) are merged into an initial frame

aVThey reported only precision measures including modified purity, and avoided extending the evaluation metrics for soft clusterings

p166
aVWhile there are many classes with consistent meanings, such as u'\u005cu201c' Class 4 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' Class 16, u'\u005cu201d' some classes have mixed meanings
p167
aVAn interesting point here is that we can use exactly the same method for these two clustering steps

aVWe evaluate these single-class outputs in the same manner as Korhonen et al

aV2010 ) on clustering evaluation
p170
aVapply dependency parsing to a raw corpus and extract predicate-argument structures for each verb from the automatic parses
p171
aVWe report results using our methods with four feature combinations (slot-only (S) and slot-word pair (SW) features each used for both the frame-generation and verb-class clustering steps) for both the Gigaword and web corpora
p172
aVThis hardening process is exactly the same as Korhonen et al
p173
aVWe summarize a few studies that consider polysemy of verbs in the rest of this section
p174
aVThere were 19,649 verbs, including phrasal verbs, and separating passive and active constructions
p175
aVEach component of these vectors is a normalized frequency, which equals a cluster/class attribute probability given a verb
p176
aVThis kind of normalization for soft clusterings was performed for other evaluation metrics as in Springorum et al
p177
aVWe first add these instances to the instances from a raw corpus and apply the two-step clustering to these merged instances

aVIn case of evaluating a hard clustering, this is equal to

aVWe took 100 samples for each input frame and selected the cluster assignment that has the highest probability
p217
aVFrom this process, we obtained a corpus of one billion sentences, totaling approximately 20 billion words
p218
aVTable 4 lists accuracies of these methods for the two corpora

aVIn this equation, the first term is the Dirichlet process prior and the second term is the likelihood of f i
p225
aVWe apply dependency parsing to a large raw corpus
p226
aVWe extracted 423,778,278 predicate-argument structures from this corpus
p227
aVWe use the induced LDA-frames that are available on the web site
p228
aVThis corpus consists of approximately 180 million sentences, which totaling four billion words
p229
aVWe set the hyper-parameters u'\u005cu0391' in ( 1 ) and u'\u005cu0392' in ( 3 ) to 1.0
p230
aVHere we experiment with both representations and compare the results
p231
aVWe use two kinds of large-scale corpora a web corpus and the English Gigaword corpus
p232
aVFinally, we discuss the results of our full experiments
p233
aVThen, we selected sentences that consist of at most 40 words, and removed duplicated sentences

p238
aVAlthough it is best to use the largest possible corpus for this kind of knowledge acquisition tasks [ 30 ] , it is infeasible to scale to giga-word corpora using such joint models
p239
aVWe extracted 2,032,774,982 predicate-argument structures
p240
aVHowever, it would take three months for this experiment using this 100 million word corpus
p241
aVTo reach 1,000 iterations, which are reported to be optimum, it would take three months
p242
aVThis can be attributed to the larger size of the web corpus
p243
aVThen, we extract predicate-argument structures from the dependency parses

aVThis work was supported by Kyoto University John Mung Program and JST CREST
p245
aVWe also used the English Gigaword corpus (LDC2011T07; English Gigaword Fifth Edition
