<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we compare STRUCT to a state-of-the-art NLG system, CRISP, 1 1 We were unfortunately unable to get the PCRISP system to compile, and so we could not evaluate it and evaluate three hypotheses i) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as it generates increasingly large referring expressions, (ii) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as the size of the grammar which they use increases, and (iii) STRUCT is capable of communicating complex propositions, including multiple concurrent goals, negated goals, and nested subclauses</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We find that, in all cases, these otherwise useless adjectives are included in the output of our generator, indicating that STRUCT is successfully balancing multiple communicative goals</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then encode these adjectives into negated communicative goals, so that they will not be included in the output of the generator, despite allowing a much shorter referring expression</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Doing so might reduce the ability of STRUCT to produce a sentence which partially fulfills its goals</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As we show in figure 6 (the u'\u201c' Positive Goals u'\u201d' curve) , the presence of additional satisfiable semantic goals does not substantially affect the time required for generation</a>
