VWe see that the language model baseline for English u'\u005cu2192' French shows the same substantial improvement over the baseline as our English u'\u005cu2192' Spanish results
p1
aVThird, we observe that adding the language model to our classifier leads to another significant gain (configuration l1r1 + LM in the results in Table 2
p2
aVAs expected, the LM baseline substantially outperforms the context-insensitive MLF baseline
p3
aVThis intuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem to be better than any other when uniformly applied to all classifier experts, but it may well be that certain classifiers benefit from different feature selections
p4
aVThe main research question in this research is how to disambiguate an L1 word or phrase to its L2 translation based on an L2 context, and whether such cross-lingual contextual approaches provide added value compared to baseline models that are not context informed or compared to standard language models
p5
aVPer classifier expert, the best scoring configuration was selected, referred to as the auto configuration in Table 2
p6
aVHowever, if we enable the language model as we do in the auto + LM configuration we do not notice an improvement over l1r1 + LM , surprisingly
p7
aVIn other words, for each word type or phrase type that occurs as a fragment in the training set, and which does not map to just a single translation, a classifier is trained
p8
aVWe therefore conducted a number of experiments with other language pairs, and present the abridged results in Table 6
p9
aVA second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier
p10
aVThe auto configuration improves results over the uniformly applied feature selection
p11
aVThe language model is a trigram-based back-off language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, computed using SRILM [] and trained on the same training data as the translation model
p12
aVOur full system, including the scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation, is implemented in Python and freely available as open-source from http://github.com/proycon/colibrita/
p13
aVWhen presented with test data, in which the L1 fragment is explicitly marked, we first check whether there is ambiguity for this L1 fragment and if a direct translation is available in our simple mapping table
p14
aVIn order to draw accurate conclusions, experiments on a single data set and language pair are not sufficient
p15
aVIf not, we check for the presence of a classifier expert for the offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by extracting the desired number of L2 local context words to the immediate left and right of this fragment and adding those to the feature vector
p16
aVThe baseline selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2 fragment according to the phrase-translation table
p17
aVWords or phrases that always map to a single translation are stored in a simple mapping table,
