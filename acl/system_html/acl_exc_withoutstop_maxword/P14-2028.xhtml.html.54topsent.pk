VThese techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method
p1
aVEach basic correction proceeds as described in Section 2.1 a small number of hypotheses h 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , h K is generated for the query q , hypotheses are scored, and scores are recomputed into normalized posterior probabilities (see Equation 5
p2
aVA standard log-linear weighing trick was applied to noisy-channel model components, see e.g., [ 9 ] u'\u005cu039b' is the parameter that controls the trade-off between precision and recall (see Section 4.2 ) by emphasizing the importance of either the high frequency of the correction or its proximity to the query

aVHowever, if our method is applied to shorter and more frequent queries (as opposed to u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d'
