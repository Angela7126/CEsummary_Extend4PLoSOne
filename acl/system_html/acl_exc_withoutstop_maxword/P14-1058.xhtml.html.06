<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In cross-domain sentiment classification, we measure the binary sentiment classification accuracy for the target domain test reviews for each pair of domains ( 12 pairs in total for 4 domains</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To overcome this problem, we use the proposed distribution prediction method to find those related features in the source domain that correspond to the features appearing in the target domain test instances</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The main reason that a model trained only on the source domain labeled data performs poorly in the target domain is the feature mismatch u'\u2013' few features in target domain test instances appear in source domain training instances</a>
