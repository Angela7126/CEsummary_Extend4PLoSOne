VPrior knowledge of the sentiment of words, such as sentiment lexicons, has been incorporated into cross-domain sentiment classification propose a joint sentiment-topic model that imposes a sentiment-prior depending on the occurrence of a word in a sentiment lexicon represent source and target domain reviews as nodes in a graph and apply a label propagation algorithm to predict the sentiment labels for target domain reviews from the sentiment labels in source domain reviews
p1
aVSpecifically, in POS tagging, a CRF trained on source domain labeled sentences is applied to target domain test sentences, whereas in sentiment classification, a logistic regression classifier trained using source domain labeled reviews is applied to the target domain test reviews
p2
aVThe main reason that a model trained only on the source domain labeled data performs poorly in the target domain is the feature mismatch u'\u005cu2013' few features in target domain test instances appear in source domain training instances
p3
aVConsequently, a tagger trained on WSJ would incorrectly tag
