<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>One simple way to combine these two system outputs in a way that does not require tuning a decision threshold is to expand the abbreviation if and only if (1) both the SVM model and the N-gram model agree on the best expansion; and (2) the SVM model score is greater than zero</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For the u'\u201c' SVM u'\u201d' model, we extract features from the log likelihood and log odds scores associated with contextual n-grams, as well as from the pair LM probability and characteristics of the abbreviation itself</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To predict the expansion given the context, we extract n-gram observations for full words in the TTS lexicon</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Taking this very high precision system combination of the N-gram and SVM models, we then combine with the baseline TTS system as follows</a>
