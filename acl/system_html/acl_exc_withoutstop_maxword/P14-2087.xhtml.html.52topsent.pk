VDistributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string matching

aVThe input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' , while the similarity measure remains unchanged

aVSpecifically, highly similar, fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both
