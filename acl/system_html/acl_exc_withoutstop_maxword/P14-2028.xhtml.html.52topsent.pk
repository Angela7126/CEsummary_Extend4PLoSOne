VA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task
p1
aVWhile choosing arg u'\u005cu2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling
p2
aVHowever, if our method is applied to shorter and more frequent queries (as opposed to u'\u005cu201d' hard u'\u005cu201d' dataset), it tends to suggest frequent words as false-positive corrections (for example, grid is corrected to creed u'\u005cu2013' Assassin u'\u005cu2019' s Creed is popular video game
