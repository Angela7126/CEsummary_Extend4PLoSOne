<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the u'\u2113' 2 -regularized linear regression model with an u'\u2113' 2 -regularized logistic regression and used Kendall u'\u2019' s u'\u03a4' rank correlation between the predicted probabilities of the positive class and the binary gold standard labels as the grid search metric ( 3.1 ) instead of Pearson u'\u2019' s r</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For the ordinal task, we report Pearson u'\u2019' s r between the averaged human judgments and each system</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So that predictions better match the distribution of labels in the training data, the system rescales its predictions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, we used the same learning algorithms as for our system (i.e.,, ridge regression for the ordinal task and logistic regression for the binary task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We created a dataset consisting of 3,129 sentences randomly selected from essays written by non-native speakers of English as part of a test of English language proficiency</a>
