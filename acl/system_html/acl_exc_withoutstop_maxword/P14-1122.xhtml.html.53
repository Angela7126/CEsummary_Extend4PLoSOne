<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For all three games, two players play the same game under time limits and then are rewarded if their answers match</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Assuming combining the audiences would produce the same number of annotations, both our games u'\u2019' costs per annotation drop to $0.012</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The strength of both crowdsourcing and games with a purpose comes from aggregating multiple annotations of a single item; i.e.,, while IAA may be low, the majority annotation of an item may be correct</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Third, we note that both video games in the paid setting incur a fixed cost (for the prizes) and therefore additional games played can only further decrease the cost per annotation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game,</a>
