<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to Sahlgren [ Sahlgren2008 ] , this kind of model captures to what extent words can be substituted for each other, which is a good measure of semantic similarity between verbs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One benefit of the distributional semantics approach is that it allows semantic similarity between words to be quantified by measuring the similarity in their distribution</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The construction is first attested in the corpus in the 1930s</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the semantic space around the novel item is dense, i.e.,, if there is a high number of similar items, the coinage will be very likely</a>
