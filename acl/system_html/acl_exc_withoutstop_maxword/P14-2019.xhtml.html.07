<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These include 8660 trees from the training set of the Penn Treebank, 360 trees from its development set and 540 trees from its test set</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>When we have a sufficiently rich corpus of parallel trees, our next step is to train a SMT learner to imitate the human translator who operates under our restricted set of operations</a>
