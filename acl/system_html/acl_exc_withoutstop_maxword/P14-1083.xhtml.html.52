<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Computation of distance to the reference translation usually involves cost functions based on sentence-level BLEU ( Nakov et al.2012 , inter alia ) and incorporates the current model score, leading to various ramp loss objectives described in Gimpel and Smith2012</a>
