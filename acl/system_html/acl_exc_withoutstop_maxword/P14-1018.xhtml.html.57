<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Sharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Other methods characterize Twitter users by applying limited amounts of network structure information in addition to lexical features</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We show that three of six social circles u'\u2013' friend, retweet and user-mention yield better accuracy compared to the user model for all graphs when t u'\u2265' 250</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Baseline User Model As input we are given a set of vertices representing users of interest v i u'\u2208' V along with feature vectors f u'\u2192' u'\u2062' ( v i ) derived from content authored by the user of interest</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In addition, we propose streaming models for personal analytics that dynamically update user labels based on their stream of communications which has been addressed previously by Van Durme ( 2012b</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus, for effectively classifying a given user v i it is better to take 200 tweets each from 10 neighbors rather than 2,000 tweets from the user</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The existing batch models for predicting latent user attributes rely on thousands of tweets per author [ 31 , 7 , 27 , 5 , 42 , 21 ]</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Similar to our work, they assume that users from a particular class tend to reply and retweet messages of the users from the same class</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Next we propose to extend the baseline model by taking advantage of language in user social circles as describe below</a>
