<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this work, we propose a learning framework for transferring dependency grammars from a resource-rich language to resource-poor languages via parallel text</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Another advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, by transferring the weight function to the corresponding weight in the well-developed English parsing model, we can project syntactic information</a>
