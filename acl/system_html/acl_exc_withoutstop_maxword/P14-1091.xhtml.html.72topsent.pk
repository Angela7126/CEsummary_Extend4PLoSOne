V1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters

aVUnlike existing KB-QA systems which treat semantic parsing and answer retrieval as two cascaded tasks, this paper presents a unified framework that can integrate semantic parsing into the question answering procedure directly
p2
aVLike MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions
