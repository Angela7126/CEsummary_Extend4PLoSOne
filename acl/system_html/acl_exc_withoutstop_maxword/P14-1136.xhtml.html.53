<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So the second baseline has the same input representation as Wsabie Embedding but uses a log-linear model instead of Wsabie</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We noted that this renders every lexical unit as seen ; in other words, at frame disambiguation time on our test set, for all instances, we only had to score the frames in F u'\u2113' for a predicate with lexical unit u'\u2113' (see 3 and 5.2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>At test time, this model chooses the best frame as argmax y u'\u2062' u'\ud835' u'\udf4d' u'\u22c5' u'\ud835' u'\udc1f' u'\u2062' ( y , x , u'\u2113' ) where argmax iterates over the possible frames y u'\u2208' F u'\u2113' if u'\u2113' was seen in the lexicon or the training data, or y u'\u2208' F , if it was unseen, like the disambiguation scheme of 3</a>
