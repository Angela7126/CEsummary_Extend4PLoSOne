VThe approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two
p1
aVInstead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data
p2
aVDirect model transfer attempts to find a shared feature representation for samples from the two languages, usually generalizing and abstracting away from language-specific representations
p3
aVWe also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an
