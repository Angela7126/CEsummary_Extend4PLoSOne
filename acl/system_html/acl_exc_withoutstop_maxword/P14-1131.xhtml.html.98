<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a result, time and space complexities are much improved</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is not obvious how to design a lower-complexity version of SimRank for this case</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The actual wall clock time was significantly lower as we used up to 64 CPUs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Consequently, we compare against the two main methods for this task in NLP</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In summary, CoSimRank and SimRank have similar space and time complexities for computing all n 2 similarities</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, we have reduced SimRank u'\u2019' s cubic time complexity to a quadratic time complexity for CoSimRank or u'\u2013' assuming that the average degree d does not depend on n u'\u2013' SimRank u'\u2019' s quadratic time complexity to linear time complexity for the case of computing few similarities</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For the more typical case that we only want to compute a fraction of all similarities, we have recast</a>
