<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>where the parameters u'\u0398' pr define the paraphrase model (Section 5 ), which is based on features extracted from text only (the input and canonical utterance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The parameters u'\u0398' lf correspond to semantic parsing features based on the logical form and input utterance, and are briefly described in this section</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Once the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Next, we heuristically generate canonical utterances for each logical form based on the text descriptions of predicates from the KB</a>
