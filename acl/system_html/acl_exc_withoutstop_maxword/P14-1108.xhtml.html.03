<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Then we trained a generalized language model as well as a standard language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on each of these samples of the training data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Modified Kneser-Ney implements smoothing by interpolating between higher and lower order n -gram language models</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is the motivation for our generalized language models to not only interpolate with one lower order model, where the first word in a sequence is omitted, but also with all other skip n -gram models, where one word is left out</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As a baseline for our generalized language model (GLM) we have trained standard language models using modified Kneser-Ney Smoothing (MKN</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As in modified Kneser-Ney smoothing we use continuation counts for the lower order models, incorporating the skip operator also for these counts</a>
