<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because traditional NLP approaches developed for formal texts often are not satisfactory when dealing with multiparty written conversations, which are typically in a casual style and do not display a clear syntactic structure with proper grammar and spelling</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To address such limitations, we propose a fully automatic unsupervised abstract generation framework based on phrasal queries for multimodal conversation summarization</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Extractive our full query-based abstractive summariztion system show statistically significant improvements over baselines and other pure extractive summarization systems for ROUGE-1 4 4 The statistical significance tests was calculated by approximate randomization, as described in [ 31 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using entailment in this phase is motivated by taking advantage of semantic relations instead of pure statistical methods (e.g.,, Maximal Marginal Relevance) and shown to be more effective [ 19 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The purpose of such a model is three-fold i) to cover the content of query information optimally; ii) to generate a more readable and grammatical sentence; and iii) to favor strong connections between the concepts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The purpose of this function is two-fold i) to generate a grammatical sentence by favoring the links between nodes (words) which appear often; and ii) to generate an informative sentence by increasing the weight of edges connecting salient nodes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then, we asked annotators to give one of three possible ratings for each sentence based on grammaticality perfect (2 pts), only one mistake (1 pt) and not acceptable (0 pts), ignoring capitalization or punctuation</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content</a>
