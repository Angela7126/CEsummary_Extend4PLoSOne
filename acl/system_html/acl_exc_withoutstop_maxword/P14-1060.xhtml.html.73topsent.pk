VConsider the following sentences tagged by the segmentation model, that would correspond to different representations of the token u'\u005cu2018' remains u'\u005cu2019' once as a standalone motif, and once as part of an encompassing bigram motif ( u'\u005cu2018' remains classified u'\u005cu2019'
p1
aVWe describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision
p2
aVWe present a framework for extending distributional semantics to learn semantic representations of both words and phrases in terms of recurrent motifs, rather than arbitrary word tokens
p3
aVWhile this framework is attractive in the lack of assumptions on representation that it makes, the use of distributional embeddings for individual tokens means that it suffers from the same shortcomings as described for the example in Table 1, and hence these methods model semantic relations between word-nodes very weakly
p4
aVHence, we use the Hellinger measure between neighbourhood motif distributions in learning representations
p5
aVSection 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmentation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications
p6
aVThe model is an instantiation of a simple featurized HMM, and the weighted sum of features corresponding to a segment is cognate with an affinity score for the u'\u005cu2018' stickiness u'\u005cu2019' of the segment, i.e.,, the affinity for the segment to be treated as holistic unit or a single motif
p7
aVGiven constituent motifs of each sentence in the data, we can now define neighbourhood distributions for unary or phrasal motifs in terms of other motifs (as envisioned in Table 1
p8
aV1 1 We note that since we take motifs as lineal units, the current method doesn u'\u005cu2019'
