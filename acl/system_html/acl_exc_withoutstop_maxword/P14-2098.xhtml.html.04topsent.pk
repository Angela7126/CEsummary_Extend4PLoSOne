VIn addition to evaluating the merging algorithms on the stand-alone task of correction detection, we have also plugged in the merging algorithms into an end-to-end system in which every automatically detected correction is further classified into an error type
p1
aVTheir approach has two components one to detect individual corrections within a revision, which they termed correction detection ; another to determine what the correction fixes, which they termed error type selection
p2
aVWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error
