<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We show that the induced cross-modal semantic space is powerful enough that sensible guesses about the correct word denoting an object can be made, even when the linguistic context vector representing the word has been created from as little as 1 sentence containing it</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>During training, this cross-modal vocabulary is used to induce a projection function (Section 4.4 ), which u'\u2013' intuitively u'\u2013' represents a mapping between visual and linguistic dimensions</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Moreover, if this is also the first linguistic encounter of that concept, then we refer to the task as fast mapping</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v u'\u2192' w</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, this function, given a visual vector, returns its corresponding linguistic representation</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this section, we aim at simulating a fast mapping scenario in which the learner has been just</a>
