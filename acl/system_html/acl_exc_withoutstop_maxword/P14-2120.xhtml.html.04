<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The results, presented in Table 4 , first demonstrate the full potential of the implied relationship recognition task to improve textual entailment recognition (Human annotation vs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Later works that followed the SemEval challenge include [ 17 ] and [ 14 ] , which proposed automatic dataset generation methods and features which capture discourse phenomena</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Such cases might follow a meronymy relation between the filler ( u'\u201c' southeastern United States u'\u201d' ) and the candidate argument ( u'\u201c' New Orleans u'\u201d' ), or certain types of discourse (co-)references (e.g.,, example 1 in Table 1 ), or some other linguistic phenomena</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This paper addresses a typical sub-task in textual inference scenarios, of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not expressed explicitly through syntactic structure</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u201c' derailment of train u'\u201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u201c' crash of train u'\u201d'</a>
