<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Finnish does not require a table, as all words can be desegmented with simple concatenation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Work on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The first feature indicates that the desegmented morphemes were translated from contiguous source words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Fortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously by composing the desegmented lattice with a finite state acceptor encoding the LM [ 26 ]</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A desegmenting transducer can be constructed by first encoding our desegmenter as a table that maps morpheme sequences to words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The lattice (Figure 1 a) can then be desegmented by composing it with the transducer ( 1 b), producing a desegmented lattice ( 1 c</a>
