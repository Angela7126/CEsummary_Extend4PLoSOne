<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We call this model Log-Linear Embedding</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We present a model that takes word embeddings as input and learns to identify semantic frames</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For comparison with our model from 3 , which we call Wsabie Embedding , we implemented two baselines with the log-linear model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Wsabie Embedding model from 3 performs significantly better than the Log-Linear Words baseline, while Log-Linear Embedding underperforms in every metric</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The second baseline, tries to decouple the Wsabie training from the embedding input, and trains a log linear model using the embeddings</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We learn the initial embedding representations for our frame identification model ( 3 ) using a deep neural language model similar to the one proposed by Bengio et al</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So the second baseline has the same input representation as Wsabie Embedding but uses a</a>
