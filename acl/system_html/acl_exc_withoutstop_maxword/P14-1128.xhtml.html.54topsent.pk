VRather than playing the u'\u005cu201c' hard u'\u005cu201d' uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging u'\u005cu201c' char-to-word u'\u005cu201d' alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning

aVSelf-training Segmenters (STS two variant models were defined by the approach reported in [ 20 ] that uses the supervised CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s decodings, incorporating empirical and constraint information, for unlabeled examples as additional labeled data to retrain a CRFs model

aVWord segmentation is regarded as a critical procedure for high-level Chinese language processing tasks, since Chinese scripts are written in continuous characters without explicit word boundaries (e.g.,, space in English
