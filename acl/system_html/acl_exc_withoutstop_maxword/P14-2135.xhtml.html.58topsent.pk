VThe Turney et al algorithm quantifies the concreteness of concepts that lack such a rating based on their proximity to rated concepts in a semantic vector space
p1
aVBy applying a logistic regression with noun concreteness as the predictor variable, Turney et al achieved a classification accuracy of 79% on this task
p2
aVWe compare dispersion filtered representations with linguistic, perceptual and standard multi-modal representations (concatenated linguistic and perceptual representations
p3
aVThe filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts
p4
aVTo evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u005cu222a' C introduced in Section 2
p5
aVMulti-modal models in which perceptual input is filtered according to our algorithm learn higher-quality semantic representations than previous approaches, resulting in a significant performance improvement of up to 17% in capturing the semantic similarity of concepts
p6
aVOn this more diverse sample, which reflects the range of concepts typically found in linguistic corpora, image dispersion is a particularly useful diagnostic for identifying the very abstract or very concrete concepts
