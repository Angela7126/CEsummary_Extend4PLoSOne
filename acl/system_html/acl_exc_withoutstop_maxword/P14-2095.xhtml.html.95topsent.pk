VWe also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an edge over annotation projection in those cases where the amount of parallel data available is limited
p1
aVOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p2
aVFor source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data
p3
aVOnce this is achieved, instances from both languages can be
