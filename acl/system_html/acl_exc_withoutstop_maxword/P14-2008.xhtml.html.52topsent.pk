VAthar ( 2011 ) on the other hand reported significant improvement using dependency relation features and found that the same list of polar words slightly hurt classification accuracy

aVOur approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features

aVBriefly, u'\u005cu201c' All u'\u005cu201d' trains on source and target data; u'\u005cu201c' Weight u'\u005cu201d' is the same as u'\u005cu201c' All u'\u005cu201d' except that instances may be weighted differently based on their domain (weights are chosen on a development set); u'\u005cu201c' Pred u'\u005cu201d' trains on the source data, makes predictions on the target data, and then trains on the target data with the predictions; u'\u005cu201c' LinInt u'\u005cu201d' linearly interpolates predictions using the source-only and target-only models (the interpolation parameter is chosen on a development set); u'\u005cu201c' Augment u'\u005cu201d'
