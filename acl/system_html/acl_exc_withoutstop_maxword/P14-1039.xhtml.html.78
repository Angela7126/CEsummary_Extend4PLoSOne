<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar u'\u2019' s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer u'\u2019' s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Rajkumar White [ 28 , 36 ] have recently shown that some rather egregious surface realization errors u'\u2014' in the sense that the reader would likely end up with the wrong interpretation u'\u2014' can be avoided by making use of features inspired by psycholinguistics research together with an otherwise state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model [ 35 ] , as reviewed in the next section</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, to develop a more nuanced self-monitoring reranker that is more robust to such parsing mistakes, we trained an SVM using dependency precision and recall features for all three parses, their n -best parsing results, and per-label precision and recall for each type of dependency, together with the realizer u'\u2019' s normalized perceptron model score as a feature</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model u'\u2019' s BLEU score of 87.93</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To improve word ordering decisions, White Rajkumar [ 36 ] demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gibson u'\u2019' s [ 12 ] dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted</a>
