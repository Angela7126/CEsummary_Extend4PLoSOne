<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While research in discourse parsing can be partitioned into several directions according to different theories and frameworks, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [ 12 ] is probably the most ambitious one, because it aims to identify not only the discourse relations in a small local context, but also the hierarchical tree structure for the full text from the relations relating the smallest discourse units (called elementary discourse units, EDUs), to the ones connecting paragraphs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, HILDA u'\u2019' s approach also has obvious weakness the greedy algorithm may lead to poor performance due to local optima, and more importantly, the SVM classifiers are not well-suited for solving structural problems due to the difficulty of taking context into account</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In particular, starting from EDUs, at each step of the tree-building, a binary SVM classifier is first applied to determine which pair of adjacent discourse constituents should be merged to form a larger span, and another multi-class SVM classifier is then applied to assign the type of discourse relation that holds between the chosen pair</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF, we include additional constraints elicited from common sense, to make more effective local decisions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In particular, starting from the constituents on the bottom level (EDUs for intra-sentential parsing and sentence-level discourse trees for multi-sentential parsing), at each step of the tree-building, we greedily merge a pair of adjacent discourse constituents such that the merged constituent has the</a>
