VFinally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser
p1
aVSegmentation accuracy is reported as an F1-score of unlabeled segment bracketing
p2
aVNote that segmentation time is negligible compared to the parsing time, hence is omitted in reported time
p3
aVFigure 2 plots the percentage of constituents from the original WSJ Penn treebank (sections 2-21) retained in the transformed version, as we vary the maximum span length parameter L
p4
aVA unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node
p5
aVIf we apply this transform to an entire treebank, we can use the transformed trees to induce a PCFG for parsing
p6
aVThe final two rows show performance with automatic segmentation, using a model that includes either unlabeled or labeled segmentation tags, as described in the last section
p7
aVSegmentation accuracy is better for the model with labels, although overall that accuracy is rather low
p8
aVKeep in mind that the number of reference constituents increases as L increases, hence both precision and recall can decrease as the parameter grows
p9
aVIt is possible to parse with a standardly induced PCFG using this sort of hedge constrained parsing that only considers a subset of the chart cells, and speedups are achieved, however
