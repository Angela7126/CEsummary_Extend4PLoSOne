VIntuitively, however, latent tree models encode low rank dependencies among the observed variables permitting the development of u'\u005cu201c' spectral u'\u005cu201d' methods that can lead to provably correct solutions
p1
aVMost existing solutions treat the problem of unsupervised parsing by assuming a generative process over parse trees e.g., probabilistic context free grammars [ Jelinek et al.1992 ] , and the constituent context model [ Klein and Manning2002 ]
p2
aVThus, strong experimental results are often achieved by initialization techniques [ Klein and Manning2002 , Gimpel and Smith2012 ] , incremental dataset use [ Spitkovsky et al.2010a ] and other specialized techniques to avoid local optima such as count transforms [ Spitkovsky et al.2013 ]

aVFollowing this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing
