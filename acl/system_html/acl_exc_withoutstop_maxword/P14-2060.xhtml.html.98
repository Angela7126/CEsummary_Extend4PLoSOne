<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The data we report on are taken from Google Maps TM and web pages associated with its map entries, but the methods can be applied to any data source that is relatively abbreviation rich</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus multiple bin features can be active for a given candidate expansion of the abbreviation</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then take the Bayesian fusion of this model with the pair LM, by adding them in</a>
