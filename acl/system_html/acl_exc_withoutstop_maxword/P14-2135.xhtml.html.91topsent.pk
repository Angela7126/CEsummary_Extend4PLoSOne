VThe Turney et al algorithm quantifies the concreteness of concepts that lack such a rating based on their proximity to rated concepts in a semantic vector space
p1
aVThe filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts
p2
aVTo evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u005cu222a' C introduced in Section 2
p3
aVBy applying a logistic regression with noun concreteness as the predictor variable, Turney et al achieved a classification accuracy of 79% on this task
p4
aVWe compare dispersion filtered representations with linguistic, perceptual and standard multi-modal representations (concatenated linguistic and perceptual representations
p5
aVOn this more diverse sample, which reflects the range of concepts typically found in linguistic corpora, image dispersion is a particularly useful diagnostic for identifying the very abstract or very concrete concepts
p6
aVWe apply image dispersion-based filtering as follows if both concepts in an evaluation pair have an image dispersion below a given threshold, both the linguistic and the visual representations are included
p7
aVAs Table 1 illustrates, the
