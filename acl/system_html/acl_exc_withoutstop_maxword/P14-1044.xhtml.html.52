<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, this alignment method still involves tuning of parameters which are highly dependent on the characteristics of the generated graphs and, hence, requires hand-crafted sense alignments for the specific pair of resources to be aligned, a task which has to be replicated every time the resources are updated</a>
