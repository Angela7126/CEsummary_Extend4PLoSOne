<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In other several research areas, such as language acquisition, bilingual word recognition [ 9 ] , corpus linguistics [ 32 ] , cross-lingual information retrieval [ 4 ] and machine translation [ 19 ] , the condition of common etymology is usually not essential and cognates are regarded as words with high cross-lingual meaning and orthographic or phonetic similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>List ( 2012 ) proposed a framework for automatic detection of cognate pairs, LexStat, which combines different approaches to sequence comparison and alignment derived from those used in historical linguistics and evolutionary biology</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Kondrak ( 2000 ) developed the ALINE system, which aligns words u'\u2019' phonetic transcriptions based on multiple phonetic features and computes similarity scores using dynamic programming</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The orthographic approach relies on the idea that sound changes leave traces in the orthography and alphabetic character correspondences represent, to a fairly large extent, sound correspondences [ 8 ]</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in</a>
