VAn approximate joint inference approach based on Lagrangian relaxation that uses DP for the maximum weight subsequence problem and LP u'\u005cu2192' MST for the maximum weight subtree problem
p1
aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions
p2
aVIn addition, we can recover approximate solutions to this problem by using the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm for recovering maximum spanning trees [ 4 , 14 ] over the relatively sparse subgraph defined by a solution to the relaxed LP
