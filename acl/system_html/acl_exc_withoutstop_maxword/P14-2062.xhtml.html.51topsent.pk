VNote that while we report agreement between the crowdsourced annotations and the crowdsourced annotations, our main evaluations are based on models learned from expert vs. crowdsourced annotations and downstream applications thereof (chunking and NER
p1
aVWe also show that these annotations lead to better POS tagging models than previous models learned from crowdsourced lexica []
p2
aVWe use the models to annotate the training data portion of each task with POS tags, and use them as features in a chunking and NER model
p3
aVSince the only difference between models are the respective POS features, the results suggest that at least for some tasks, POS taggers learned from crowdsourced annotations may be as good
