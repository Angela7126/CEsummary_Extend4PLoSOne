<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In contrast, we expand features for parsing into a multi-way tensor, and operate with an explicit low-rank representation of the associated parameter tensor</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By taking the cross-product of all these component feature vectors, we obtain the full feature representation for arc h u'\u2192' m as a rank-1 tensor</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The associated parameters are viewed as a tensor (multi-way array) of low rank, and optimized for parsing performance</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We will commence here by casting first-order dependency parsing as a tensor estimation problem</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We will directly learn a low-rank tensor A (because r is small) in this form as one of our model parameters</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By learning parameters U , V , and W that function well in dependency parsing, we also learn context-dependent embeddings for words and arcs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Based on this feature representation, we define the score of each arc as s u'\u0398' ( h u'\u2192' m ) = u'\u27e8' u'\u0398' , u'\u03a6' h u'\u2192' m u'\u27e9' where u'\u0398' u'\u2208' u'\u211d' L represent adjustable parameters to be learned, and L is the number of parameters (and possible features in u'\u03a6' h u'\u2192' m</a>
