<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly deal with very specific communicative goals</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on these state and action definitions, the transition function takes a mapping between a partial sentence / action pair and the partial sentences which can result from one particular PLTAG adjoin / substitution, and returns the probability of that rule in the grammar</a>
