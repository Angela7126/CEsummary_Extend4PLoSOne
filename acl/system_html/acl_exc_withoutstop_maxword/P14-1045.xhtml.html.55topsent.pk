VOne advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations
p1
aVIntrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects []
p2
aVThey are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard []
p3
aVThe method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u005cu201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u005cu201d'
p4
aVEvaluating distributional resources is the subject of a lot of methodological reflection [] , and as we said in the introduction, evaluations can be divided between extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations
p5
aVWe do this by judging the relevance of a lexical relation in a context where both elements of a lexical pair occur
p6
aVWe differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u005cu201c' existential u'\u005cu201d' view of semantic relatedness
p7
aVAs for improving distributional thesauri, outside of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial thesaurus is built [] , or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given target []
