<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These labeled topics are used to create a new topic model such that in the new model topics are better aligned to class labels</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As the most probable words of topics are representative of the dataset, there is no need for the annotator to search for the right set of features for each class</a>
