<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The second baseline (CR + LS) trains a reranking model without discourse, using just the CR and LS features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This way, the DMM and DPM features jointly capture discourse structures and semantic similarity between answer segments and question</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the Bio corpus where answer candidates consist of entire paragraphs of a biology text, overall performance is dominated by inter-sentence discourse features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>That this absolute performance increase is nearly identical indicates that LS features are complementary to and additive with the full discourse model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because these discourse models appear to capture high-level information about answer structures, we hypothesize that the models should make use of many of the same discourse features, even when training on data from different domains</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Driven by this observation, our main hypothesis is that the discourse structure of NF answers provides complementary information to state-of-the-art QA models that measure the similarity (either lexical and/or semantic) between question and answer</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The values of the discourse features are the mean of the similarity scores (e.g.,, cosine similarity using tf.idf weighting) of the two marker arguments and the corresponding question</a>
