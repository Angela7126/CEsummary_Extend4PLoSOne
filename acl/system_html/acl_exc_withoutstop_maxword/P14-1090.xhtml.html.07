<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We define answer node as the node that is the answer and answer relation as the relation from the answer node to its direct parent</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For each question, we extracted all relations in its corresponding topic graph, and ranked each relation with whether it is the answer relation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We call this a question feature graph , with every node and relation a potential feature for this question</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We treat QA on Freebase as a binary classification task for each node in the topic graph, we extract features and judge whether it is the answer node</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus for the Freebase graph, we use relations (with directions) and properties as features for each node</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These properties, along with the sibling relationship to the topic node, are important cues for answering the question</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Given a topic, we selectively roll out the Freebase graph by choosing those nodes</a>
