VOther approaches view NLG as a planning problem [ 10 ]
p1
aVWe formulate NLG as a planning problem on a Markov decision process (MDP) [ 15 ]
p2
aVThis also allows partial completion of communicative goals if not all goals can be achieved simultaneously in the time given
p3
aVThis setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly deal with very specific communicative goals
p4
aVThus we use as a reward a measure of the match between the semantic annotation of the partial tree and the communicative goal
p5
aVNote that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees
p6
aVUsing the UCT approach with a suitably defined MDP (explained above) allows us to naturally handle probabilistic grammars as well as formulate NLG as a planning problem, unifying the distinct lines of attack described in Section 2
