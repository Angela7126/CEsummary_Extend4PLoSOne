<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
