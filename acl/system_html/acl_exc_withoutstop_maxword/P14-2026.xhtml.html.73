<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By applying our rules and Wang et al u'\u2019' s rules, one can use both dependency and constituency parsers for pre-ordering in Chinese-English PBSMT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the reordering produced a Chinese phrase that had a closer word order to that of the English one, this structure would be a candidate pre-ordering rule</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Further, we define X and Y as the corresponding dependency structures of the dependency relations x and y , respectively</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we applied a rule plmod lobj (localizer object) to reposition the dependent word of the plmod relation (e.g.,, u'\u201c' u'\u201d' in Figure 2) to the position before the lobj structure</a>
