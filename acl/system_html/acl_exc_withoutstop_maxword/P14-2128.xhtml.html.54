<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with no ambiguity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy</a>
