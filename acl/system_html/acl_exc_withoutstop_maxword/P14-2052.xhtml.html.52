<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Extractive summarization is one well-known approach to text summarization and extractive methods represent a document (or a set of documents) as a set of some textual units (e.g.,, sentences, clauses, and words) and select their subset as a summary</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, the models have tended to select small fragments from many sentences to maximize objective functions and have led to fragmented summaries being generated</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, we formulate the problem of single document summarization as that of combinatorial optimization, which is based on the trimming of the nested tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, their method required large sets of data to calculate the accurate probability</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We counted the number of sentences in the source document that each method used to generate a summary 5 5 Note that the number for the EDU method is not equal to selected textual units because a sentence in the source document may contain multiple EDUs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This capability is very effective because we have to contain important content in summaries within given length limits, especially</a>
