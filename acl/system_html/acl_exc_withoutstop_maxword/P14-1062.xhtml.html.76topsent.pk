VIn the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network
p1
aVBy adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []
p2
aVLike in the convolutional networks for object recognition [] , we enrich the representation in the first layer by computing multiple feature maps with different filters applied to the input sentence
p3
aVHigher-order features have highly variable ranges that can be either short and focused or global and long as the input sentence
p4
aVFinally, a further class of neural sentence models is based on the convolution operation and the TDNN architecture []
p5
aVThe binary result is based on a DCNN that has a
