VWe then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4
p1
aVDo users prefer hierarchical summaries for topic exploration
p2
aVAfter the sentences are clustered, we have a structure for the hierarchical summary that dictates the number of summaries and the number of sentences in each summary
p3
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering
p4
aVOne of the authors then manually identified the presence of these events in the hierarchical summaries, the timelines and the flat MDS summaries
p5
aVIntuitively, each cluster summary in the hierarchical summary should convey the most salient information in that cluster
p6
aVInput to a hierarchical summarization system is a set of related documents D and a budget b for each summary within the hierarchy (in bytes, words, or sentences
p7
aVUsers navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused
p8
aVHow coherent is the hierarchical structure in the summaries
p9
aVWe conducted
