VFirst, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced
p1
aVAlso, as suggested by the experimental result, among the four corpora, FCE corpus is a comparably good resource for training correction detection models with our current feature set
p2
aVThe models built on corpora can generally improve the correction detection accuracy 5 5 We currently do not evaluate the end-to-end system over different corpora
p3
aVWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address
