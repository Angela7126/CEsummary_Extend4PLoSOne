<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The set of POS tags needs to be consistent across languages and treebanks</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, by transferring the weight function to the corresponding weight in the well-developed English parsing model, we can project syntactic information across language boundaries</a>
