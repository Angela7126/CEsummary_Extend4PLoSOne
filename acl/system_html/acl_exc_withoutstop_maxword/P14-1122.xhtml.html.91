<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Players perform a single action in SuchGame after being shown a concept c and its textual definition, a player answers whether an item is related to the concept</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The player must then recover the knowledge of the target concept by acquiring pictures of it</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations</a>
