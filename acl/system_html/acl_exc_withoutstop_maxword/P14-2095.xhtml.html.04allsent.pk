(lp0
VInstead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data
p1
aVFor example, a certain preposition attached to a token in the source language might map into a morphological tag in the target language, which would be hard to handle for traditional direct model transfer other than using some kind of refinement procedure involving parallel data
p2
aVOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p3
aVIt is also somewhat similar in spirit to , where a small number of word translation pairs are used to estimate a mapping between distributed representations of words in two different languages and build a word translation model
p4
aVWe did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their dimension when evaluated on source language u'\u005cu2013' in our experiments the performance of the monolingual classifier does not improve significantly if the dimension is increased past 300 and decreases only by a small margin (less than one absolute point) if it is reduced to 100
p5
aVThe approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two
p6
aVWe also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an edge over annotation projection in those cases where the amount of parallel data available is limited
p7
aVThe shared feature representation for direct transfer is derived from u'\u005cu03a9' 0 by replacing language-specific part-of-speech tags with universal ones [] and adding cross-lingual word clusters [] to word types
p8
aVReplacing language-specific dependency annotations with the universal ones [] may help somewhat, but we would still expect the methods directly relying on parallel data to achieve better results given a sufficiently large parallel corpus
p9
aVWe consider a pair of languages ( L s , L t ) and assume that an annotated training set D T s = { ( x s , y s ) } is available in the source language as well as a parallel corpus of instance pairs D s u'\u005cu2062' t = { ( x s , x t ) } and a target dataset D E t = { x t } that needs to be labeled
p10
aVThe quality of predictions on source sentences depends heavily on the quality of parallel data and the domain it belongs to (or, rather, the similarity between this domain and that of the corpus the source-language model was trained on
p11
aVDirect model transfer attempts to find a shared feature representation for samples from the two languages, usually generalizing and abstracting away from language-specific representations
p12
aVAlthough some of the features u'\u005cu2013' namely, gloss translations and cross-lingual clusters u'\u005cu2013' used in direct transfer are, in fact, derived from parallel data, we consider the effect of this on the performance of direct transfer to be indirect and outside the scope of this work
p13
aVThe available parallel data itself may also be used more comprehensively u'\u005cu2013' aligned arguments of aligned predicates, for example, constitute only a small part of it, while the mapping of vector representations of individual tokens is likely to be the same for all aligned words
p14
aVInstead, it operates on translation pairs, usually on sentence level, applying the available source-side model to the source sentence and transferring the resulting annotations through the word alignment links to the target one
p15
aVCross-lingual model transfer approaches are concerned with creating statistical models for various tasks for languages poor in annotated resources, utilising resources or models available for these tasks in other languages
p16
aVIf parallel data is available, it can be further used to enforce model agreement on this data to adjust for discrepancies between the two languages, for example by means of projected transfer []
p17
aVThe rather inferior performance of direct transfer baseline on English-French may be partially attributed to the fact that it cannot rely on dependency relation features, as the corpora we consider make use of different dependency relation inventories
p18
aVWe design a pair of intermediate compact monolingual feature representations u'\u005cu03a9' 1 s and u'\u005cu03a9' 1 t and models M s and M t to map source and target samples x s and x t from their original representations, u'\u005cu03a9' 0 s and u'\u005cu03a9' 0 t , to the new ones
p19
aVThe shared feature representation depends on the task in question, but most often each aspect of the original feature representation is handled separately
p20
aVTo go further, one can, for example, apply dimensionality reduction techniques to obtain a more compact representation of u'\u005cu03a9' 1 by eliminating redundancy or define auxiliary tasks and produce a vector representation useful for those tasks
p21
aVTo start with, we replace word types with corresponding neural language model representations estimated using the skip-gram model []
p22
aVOverall, we observe that the proposed method with u'\u005cu03a9' 1 representation demonstrates performance competitive to direct transfer and annotation projection baselines
p23
aVCompared to annotation projection, our approach may be expected to be less sensitive to parallel data quality, since we do not have to commit to a particular prediction on a given instance from parallel data
p24
aVEstimating the mapping directly from raw categorical features ( u'\u005cu03a9' 0 ) is both computationally expensive and likely inaccurate u'\u005cu2013' using one-hot encoding the feature vectors in our experiments would have tens of thousands of components
p25
aVFor source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data
p26
aVOnce this is achieved, instances from both languages can be mapped into this space and a model trained on the source-language data directly applied to the target language
p27
aVWe also use this framework to estimate the linear mapping M t u'\u005cu2062' s between source and target feature spaces in FRP
p28
aVThe source-side instances from a parallel corpus are labeled using a classifier trained on source-language training data and transferred to the target side
p29
aVIn general, however, retaining only relevant aspects of intermediate monolingual representations would simplify the estimation of mapping between them and make FRP more robust
p30
aVWord types, for example, may be replaced by cross-lingual word clusters [] or cross-lingual distributed word representations []
p31
aVA more common approach would be to project the whole structure from the source language, but in our case this may give unfair advantage to feature representation projection, which relies on target-side argument identification
p32
aVOne of the strong points of direct model transfer is that it naturally fits the multi-source transfer setting
p33
aVThe classification error of FRP and the baselines given varying amount of parallel data is reported in figures 2 , 3 and 4
p34
aVIt is similar to direct transfer in that we also use a shared feature representation
p35
aVThat includes approaches such as direct model transfer [] and annotation projection []
p36
aVIn our setting, each instance includes the word type and part-of-speech and morphological tags (if any) of argument token, its parent and corresponding predicate token, as well as their dependency relations to their respective parents
p37
aVPotential sources of such information include dictionary entries or information about the mapping between certain elements of syntactic structure, for example a known part-of-speech tag mapping
p38
aVThe transfer itself also introduces errors due to translation shifts [] and word alignment errors, which may lead to inaccurate predictions
p39
aVIt remains to be seen which one would produce the best results and how multi-source feature representation projection would compare to, for example, multi-source projected transfer []
p40
aVWe evaluate feature representation projection on the task of dependency-based semantic role labeling (SRL) []
p41
aVNote that predicate and argument identification in both languages is performed using monolingual classifiers and only aligned pairs are used in projection
p42
aVThe word types themselves are left as they are in the source language and replaced with their gloss translations in the target one []
p43
aVIn source language, one can even directly tune an intermediate representation for the target problem
p44
aVThen a classification model M y is trained on the source training data
p45
aVPlease note that we report only a single value for direct transfer, since this approach does not explicitly rely on parallel data
p46
aVBoth monolingual data and that from the parallel corpus are included in the training
p47
aVApart from the work on direct/projected transfer and annotation projection mentioned above, the proposed method can be seen as a more explicit kind of domain adaptation, similar to or
p48
aVAlso, should one like to apply constraints on the set of semantic roles in a given predicate, or, for example, use a reranker [] , this can be done using a factorized model obtained by cross-lingual transfer
p49
aVAs mentioned above we compare the performance of this approach to that of direct transfer and annotation projection
p50
aVThe amount of parallel data available for many language pairs is growing steadily
p51
aVNote also that any such refinement procedure applicable to direct transfer would likely work for FRP as well
p52
aVParallel data for both language pairs is derived from Europarl [] , which we pre-process using mate-tools []
p53
aVThis corresponds to M s and M t above and reduces the dimension of the feature space, making direct estimation of the mapping practical
p54
aVIt should be noted, however, that the dimension that is optimal in this sense is not necessarily the best choice for FRP , especially if the amount of available parallel data is limited
p55
aVHowever, cross-lingual transfer methods are often applied in cases where parallel resources are scarce or of poor quality and must be used with care
p56
aVThis task consists in identifying predicates and their arguments in sentences and assigning each argument a semantic role with respect to its predicate (see figure 1
p57
aVWe use the parallel instances in the new feature representation
p58
aVNote that only a single word u'\u005cu2013' the syntactic head of the argument phrase u'\u005cu2013' is marked as an argument in this case, as opposed to constituent- or span-based SRL []
p59
aVThe number of parallel instances in these experiments is shown on a logarithmic scale, the values considered are 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 thousand pairs
p60
aVDatasets for other languages are sufficiently large, so we take 30 thousand samples for testing and use the rest as training data
p61
aVSuch methods have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging [] , syntactic parsing [] , semantic role labeling [] and others
p62
aVSince the size of the latter dataset is relatively small u'\u005cu2013' one thousand sentences u'\u005cu2013' we reserve the whole dataset for testing and only evaluate transfer from English to French, but not the other way around
p63
aVWe use the same type of log-linear classifiers in the model itself and the two baselines to avoid any discrepancy due to learning procedure
p64
aVThe representation we used in the initial evaluation does not discriminate between aspects that are relevant for the assignment of semantic roles and those that are not
p65
aVThe authors would like to acknowledge the support of MMCI Cluster of Excellence and Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science and thank the anonymous reviewers for their suggestions
p66
aVThe validation set in each experiment is withheld from the corresponding training corpus and contains 10 thousand samples
p67
aVFor target language, however, we assume that no labeled data is available and auxiliary tasks have to be used to achieve this
p68
aVAnnotation projection, on the other hand, does not require any changes to the feature representation
p69
aVIt is well known that such interaction plays an important part in SRL [] , but it is not well understood which kinds of interactions are preserved across languages and which are not
p70
aVIn the first case, the data is converted from Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 [] using the script from
p71
aVThere is a number of ways to make this representation more compact
p72
aVFor the sake of simplicity we cast it as a multiclass classification problem, ignoring the interaction between different arguments in a predicate
p73
aVIn the second, we use CoNLL 2009 shared task [] corpus for English and the manually corrected dataset from for French
p74
aVThe 250-dimensional word representations for u'\u005cu03a9' 1 are obtained using Word2vec tool
p75
aVIn the authors consider embeddings of up to 800 dimensions, but we would not expect to benefit as much from larger vectors since we are using a much smaller corpus to train them
p76
aVUnfortunately, the design of such representations and corresponding conversion procedures is by no means trivial
p77
aVIn English-Czech and Czech-English we also use the dependency relation information, since the annotations are partly compatible
p78
aVThe annotation projection baseline implementation is straightforward
p79
aVand the labels are assigned to the target samples x t u'\u005cu2208' D E t using a composition of the models
p80
aVThe training set for each language is fixed
p81
aVBoth baselines are using the same set of features as the proposed model, as described earlier
p82
aVThese issues are generally handled using heuristics [] and filtering, for example based on alignment coverage []
p83
aVThis allows us to make use of language-specific annotations and account for the interplay between different types of information
p84
aVWe use two language pairs for evaluation
p85
aVWe denote the two baselines AP (annotation projection) and DT (direct transfer
p86
aVSince we are using a relatively small set of features to start with, this does not present much of a problem
p87
aVIn such situations an ability to use alternative sources of information may be crucial
p88
aVThis paper reports work in progress and there is a number of directions we would like to pursue further
p89
aVWe focus on the assignment of semantic roles to identified arguments
p90
aVThere are several possible ways of adapting FRP to such a setting
p91
aVThe resulting annotations are then used to train a target-side classifier for evaluation
p92
aVto determine the mapping M t u'\u005cu2062' s (usually, linear) between the two spaces
p93
aVPart-of-speech tags, which are often language-specific, can be converted into universal part-of-speech tags [] and morpho-syntactic information can also be represented in a unified way []
p94
aVThis representation is further denoted u'\u005cu03a9' 0
p95
aVWe will refer to this representation as u'\u005cu03a9' 1
p96
aVThese classifiers are implemented using Pylearn2 [] , based on Theano []
