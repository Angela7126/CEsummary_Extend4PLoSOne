<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose to perform joint inference upon multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit clues that are encoded with relation specific requirements and can be learnt from existing knowledge bases</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we will address how to derive and exploit two categories of these clues the expected types and the cardinality requirements of a relation u'\u2019' s arguments, in the scenario of relation extraction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The previous categories of disagreements are all based on the implicit type information of the relations u'\u2019' arguments, Now we make use of the clues of argument cardinality requirements</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two</a>
