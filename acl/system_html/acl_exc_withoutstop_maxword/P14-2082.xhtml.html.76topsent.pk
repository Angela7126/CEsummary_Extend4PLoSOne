VThey have the densest annotation, but u'\u005cu201c' the annotator was not required to annotate all pairs of event mentions, but as many as possible u'\u005cu201d' .This paper takes a different tack to annotation by requiring annotators to label every possible pair of events/times in a given window
p1
aVOur proposal thus starts with documents that have been already been annotated with events, time expressions, and document creation times (DCT
p2
aVSince the annotators are forced to label all required edges, the decision to label an edge as vague instead of a defined temporal relation is critical
p3
aVThe original annotators were instructed to label relations critical to the document u'\u005cu2019' s understanding
p4
aVIn contrast, we aim for a shift in the community wherein all pairs are considered candidates for temporal ordering, allowing researchers to ask questions such as how must algorithms adapt to label the complete graph of pairs, and if the more difficult and ambiguous event pairs are included, how must
