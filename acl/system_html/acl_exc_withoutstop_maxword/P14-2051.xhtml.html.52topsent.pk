VThe co-occurrence matrix was transformed by applying a Point-wise Mutual Information weighting scheme, using the DISSECT toolkit [ Dinu et al.2013 ] , to turn the raw frequencies into weights that reflect how distinctive a collocate is for a given target word with respect to the other target words under consideration

aVThis result illustrates the role of type frequency in syntactic productivity a measure of density that is supported by a higher number of types makes better prediction than a measure supported by fewer types
p2
aVAlong these lines, Suttle and Goldberg [ Suttle and Goldberg2011 , 1254] posit a criterion of coverage, defined as u'\u005cu201c' the degree to which attested instances u'\u005cu2018' cover u'\u005cu2019' the category determined jointly by attested instances together with the target coinage u'\u005cu201d'
p3
aVThese finding support the view that semantic density and type frequency, while they both positively influence syntactic productivity, do so in different ways density defines the necessary conditions for a new coinage to occur, while type frequency increases
