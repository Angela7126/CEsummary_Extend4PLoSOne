<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On the Flickr8k data set, all evaluation measures can be classified as either weakly correlated or moderately correlated with human judgements and all results are significant ter is only weakly correlated with human judgements but could prove useful in comparing the types of differences between models</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This discrepancy could be explained in terms of the differences between the weather forecast generation and image description tasks, or because the image description data sets contain thousands of texts and a few human judgements per text, whereas the data sets of Reiter and Belz ( 2009 ) included hundreds of texts with 30 human judges</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is therefore difficult to directly compare the results of our correlation analysis against Hodosh et al u'\u2019' s agreement analysis, but they also reach the conclusion that unigram bleu is not an appropriate measure of image description performance</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In Figure 3 (a), the authors of the descriptions made different decisions on what to describe</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is defined as the geometric mean of the effective n-gram precision scores, multiplied by the brevity penalty factor B u'\u2062' P to penalise short translations p n measures the effective overlap by calculating the proportion of the maximum number of n-grams co-occurring between a candidate and a reference and the total number of n-grams in the candidate text</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This could be caused by the smaller sample size or because the descriptions were generated by a computer,</a>
