<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Poor chunker perfomance is likely due to a mismatch in chunker training and testing domains (Wall Street Journal text vs transcribed speech), but chunking noise may be a good estimation of learner uncertainty, so the remaining text is left uncorrected</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This approach to filler-gap comprehension is supported by findings that show people do not actually link fillers to gap positions but instead link the filler to a verb with missing arguments [] Further, the model presented here is also shown to initially reflect an idiosyncratic role assignment error observed in development (e.g., A and B kradded interpreted as A kradded B ; Gertner and Fisher, 2012 ), though after training, the model is able to avoid the error</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Further, similar to real children (see Figure 1 ) the model presented in this paper develops beyond this error by the end</a>
