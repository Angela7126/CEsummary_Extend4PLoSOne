<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Besides using the semantic similarities to prune the phrase table, we also employ them as two informative features like the phrase translation probability to guide translation hypotheses selection during decoding</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation candidate selection</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, our model can be easily adapted to learn semantic phrase embeddings using paraphrases</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, the semantic similarities computed using our BRAE model are complementary to the existing four translation probabilities</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In contrast, our BRAE model learns the semantic meaning for each phrase no matter whether it is short or relatively long</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Besides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual question answering, since the semantic similarity between phrases in</a>
