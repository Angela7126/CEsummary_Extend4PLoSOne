<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An approximate joint inference approach based on Lagrangian relaxation that uses DP for the maximum weight subsequence problem and LP u'\u2192' MST for the maximum weight subtree problem</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, we can recover approximate solutions to this problem by using the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm for recovering maximum spanning trees [ 4 , 14 ] over the relatively sparse subgraph defined by a solution to the relaxed LP</a>
