VWordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding word forms) that are semantic related to the inventory senses under WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been exploited by many existing studies
p1
aVThe input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' , while the similarity measure remains unchanged
p2
aVThese systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods
p3
aVDistributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string matching
p4
aVThe foregoing discussion offers a second motivation for applying Bayes u'\u005cu2019' s rule on the second expression in Equation ( 1 it is easier to estimate p ( e i f j ) than p ( f j e i ) , since the vocabulary for the lexical knowledge features ( f j ) is usually more limited than that of the contexts ( e i ) and hence estimation of the former suffices on a smaller amount of data than that of the latter
p5
aVTo address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of overlap in gloss-based WSD
p6
aVThe result is a u'\u005cu201c' softer u'\u005cu201d' proxy of association than the binary view of overlaps in existing Lesk variants
p7
aVKnown as the Lesk algorithm, this simple and intuitive method has since been extensively cited and extended in the word sense disambiguation (WSD) community
p8
aVA major difference, however, is that instead of using hard, overlap counts between the two sets of words from the gloss and the context, this probabilistic treatment can implicitly model the distributional similarity among the elements e i and f j (and consequently between the sets u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1e' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' ) over a wider range of contexts
p9
aVModel performance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy using Equation ( 2 ) as the scoring function
p10
aVConsequently, p ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1e' ) is essentially measuring the association between context words of w and definition texts of s , i.e.,, the gloss-context association in the simplified Lesk algorithm
p11
aVWSD is thus formulated as identifying the sense s * in the sense inventory u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' of w s.t
p12
aVWe further hypothesize that, beyond sheer numbers, synonyms and hyponyms offer stronger semantic specification that helps distinguish the senses of a given ambiguous word, and thus are more effective knowledge sources for WSD
p13
aVTo the best of our knowledge, NBMs have been employed exclusively as classifiers in WSD u'\u005cu2014' that is, in contrast to their use as a similarity measure in this study used NB classifier resembling an information retrieval system a WSD instance is regarded as a document d , and candidate senses are scored in terms of u'\u005cu201c' relevance u'\u005cu201d' to d
p14
aVSpecifically in WSD, a source corpus is defined as the source of the majority of the WSD instances in a given dataset, and a baseline corpus of a smaller size and less resemblance to the instances is used for all datasets
p15
aVIn the second expression, Bayes u'\u005cu2019' s rule is applied not only to take advantage of the conditional independence among e i u'\u005cu2019' s, but also to facilitate probability estimation, since p ( { e i } f j ) is easier to estimate in the context of WSD, where sample spaces of u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1e' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' become asymmetric (Section 3.2
p16
aVHyponyms, on the other hand, help specify their corresponding senses with information that is possibly missing from the often overly brief glosses the many technical terms as hyponyms in Table 1 u'\u005cu2014' though rare u'\u005cu2014' are likely to occur in the (possibly domain-specific) contexts that are highly typical of the corresponding senses
p17
aVBecause it is a rare event for the NBM to produce identical scores, 4 4 This has never occurred in the hundreds of thousands of runs in our development process the model always proposes a unique answer and accuracy is thus equivalent to F-score commonly used in existing reports
p18
aVBy using only glosses, the proposed model already shows statistically significant improvement over the basic Lesk algorithm (92.4% and 140.5% relative improvement in Senseval-2 coarse- and fine-grained tracks, respectively
p19
aVAmong the popular explanations is a key limitation of the algorithm, that u'\u005cu201c' Lesk u'\u005cu2019' s approach is very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions, so the absence of a certain word can radically change the results u'\u005cu201d' ()
p20
aV5 5 We also compared the two Lesk baselines (with and without usage examples) on the development data but did not observe significant differences as reported by
p21
aVIn the extraordinarily rich literature on WSD, we focus our review on those closest to the topic of Lesk and NBM
p22
aVTo evaluate model response to probability estimation of different quality (Section 3.4 ), source corpora are chosen as the majority value of the doc-source attribute of instances in each dataset, namely, the British National Corpus for Senseval-2 (94%) and the Wall Street Journal for SemEval-2007 (86%
p23
aVAccuracy is defined as the number of correct responses over the number of instances
p24
aVFor the fine-grained track, it achieves 2nd place after that of , which used a decision list () on manually selected corpora evidence for each inventory sense, and thus is not subject to loss of distinguishability in the glosses as Lesk variants are
p25
aV8 8 We excluded the results of UNED () in Senseval-2 because, by using sense frequency information that is only obtainable from sense-annotated corpora, it is essentially a supervised system
p26
aVwhere c u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) is the count of word x , c u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is the corpus size, c u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) is the joint count of x and y , and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' is the dimension of vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f'
p27
aVWe also observe that some semantically related words appear under rare senses (e.g.,, still as an alcohol-manufacturing plant, and annual as a one-year-life-cycle plant; omitted from Table 1
p28
aVBreaking away from string matching, measured overlap as similarity between gloss- and context-vectors, which were aggregated word vectors encoding second order co-occurrence information in glosses
p29
aVBasic pre-processing is performed on the contexts and the glosses, including lower-casing, stopword removal, lemmatization on both datasets, and tokenization on the Senseval-2 instances
p30
aVThe comparison is unavailable in SemEval2007 since we have not found existing experiments with this exact configuration
p31
aVSpecifically, highly similar, fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both semantic and distributional), we postulate that their probability in the NBM is uniformly inflated among many sense candidates, and hence they decrease in distinguishability
p32
aVAs pointed out by , however, u'\u005cu201c' not all of these relations are equally helpful u'\u005cu201d' Relation pairs involving hyponyms were shown to result in better F-measure when used in gloss overlaps
p33
aV1 1 Think of the notations u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1e' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' mnemonically as exemplars and features , respectively
p34
aVIn one of their simplest forms, e i u'\u005cu2019' s correspond to co-occurring words in the instance of w , and f j u'\u005cu2019' s consist of the gloss words of sense s

aVTo avoid underflow, Equation ( 1 ) is estimated as the following log probability
p37
aVWhat type of knowledge to include is eventually a decision made by the user based on the application and LK availability
p38
aVMore recently, proposed a tree-matching algorithm that measured gloss-context overlap as the weighted sum of dependency-induced lexical distance constructed a sentential similarity measure () using lexical similarity measures () , and overlap was measured by the cosine of their respective sentential vectors
p39
aVOverlap was assessed by string matching, with the number of matching words squared so as to assign higher scores to multi-word overlaps

aVTraining sections are used as development data and test sections held out for final testing
