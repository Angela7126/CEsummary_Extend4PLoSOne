<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Obviously, the 1 st order tensor (vector) model is the most expressive, since it is structureless and any arbitrary set of numbers can always be represented exactly as a vector</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However if we use a 2 nd order tensor model, organize the features into a 1000 1000 matrix u'\ud835' u'\udebd' , and use just one rank-1 matrix to approximate the weight tensor, then the linear model becomes</a>
