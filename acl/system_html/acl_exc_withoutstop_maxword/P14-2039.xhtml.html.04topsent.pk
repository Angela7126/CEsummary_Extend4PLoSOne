VThe sliding alignment window with keep-length 0.5 achieves 0.5679 average accuracy in terms of (1-WER), providing a 18.09% improvement with respect to the most accurate fixed alignment window (average accuracy 0.4857
p1
aV[] addressed this alignment problem using off-the-shelf multiple sequence alignment tools, as well as an algorithm based on incrementally building a precedence graph over output words

aVWe set the heuristic weight parameter ( w ) to 3 and the chunk size parameter ( c ) to 5 seconds for all the three sliding window systems and the fixed window system
