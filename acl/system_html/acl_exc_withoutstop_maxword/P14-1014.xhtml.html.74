<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data</a>
