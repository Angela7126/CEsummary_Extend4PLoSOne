<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) update summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>P u'\u2062' ( H ) gives a prior probability to each hypothesis based on the information in the background corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So new words in an input are added to the background corpus with a count of 1 and the counts of existing words in the background are incremented by 1 before computing the prior parameters</a>
