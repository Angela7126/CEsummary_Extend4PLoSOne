VSupersenses are particularly attractive features for metaphor detection coarse sense taxonomies can be viewed as semantic concepts, and since concept mapping is a process in which metaphors are born, we expect different supersense co-occurrences in metaphoric and literal combinations
p1
aVWe cannot compare directly our model with this work because our classifier is restricted to detection of only SVO and AN metaphors
p2
aV1) we develop a new state-of-the-art English metaphor detection system that uses conceptual semantic features, such as a degree of abstractness and semantic supersenses; 2 2 https://github.com/ytsvetko/metaphor (2) we create new metaphor-annotated corpora for Russian and English; 3 3 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/metaphor/datasets.zip (3) using a paradigm of model transfer [ 21 , 41 , 15 ] , we provide support for the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual (rather than lexical) in nature by showing that our English-trained model can detect metaphors in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian
p3
aVEnglish adjectives do not, as yet, have a similar high-level semantic partitioning in WordNet, thus we use a 13-class taxonomy of adjective supersenses constructed
