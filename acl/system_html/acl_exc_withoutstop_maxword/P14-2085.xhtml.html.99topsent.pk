VTo sum up, Inst features are essential for classifying multi-label verbs, and the LingInd features provide some useful prior
p1
aVIn addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types
p2
aVTherefore we propose handling ambiguous verbs separately
p3
aVUsing the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the feature Lemma
p4
aVFor verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that
p5
aVWhether or not performance is improved by adding LingInd/Dist features, with their bias towards one aspectual class, depends on the verb type
p6
aVAs Asp-MASC contains only few instances of each of the ambiguous verbs, we turn to the Asp-Ambig dataset
p7
aVIn contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs
p8
aVFor multi-label verbs, the feature combination Lemma+LingInd+Inst leads to significant 5 improvement
