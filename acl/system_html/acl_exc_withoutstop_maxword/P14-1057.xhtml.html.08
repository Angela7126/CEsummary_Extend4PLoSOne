<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Experimental results over two TREC collections show that both proposed concept-based weighting regularization methods can improve the retrieval performance, and their performance is comparable with the best systems of the TREC Medical Records tracks [ 25 , 24 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Results show that Balanced method can significantly improve the retrieval performance over both collections</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>There are three options select the concept with the maximum IDF, average IDF, or minimum IDF</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In particular, we first formalize retrieval constraints that any reasonable concept-based representation methods should satisfy and then discuss how to regularize the existing weighting strategies to satisfy the constraints and improve the retrieval performance</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To address the limitations caused by the inaccurate mapping results, we propose to apply axiomatic approaches [ 7 ] to regularize the weighting strategies for concept-based representation methods</a>
