VThe syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models, and the gain achieved by the semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the MR08 syntactic features
p1
aVIt shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board
p2
aVTo show the effectiveness of our reordering models, we integrate both syntactic constituent reordering models and semantic role reordering models into a state-of-the-art HPB system [ 4 , 7 ]
p3
aVThe reordering type distribution on the reordering model training data in Table 3 suggests that semantic reordering is more difficult than syntactic reordering
p4
aVThe syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models on both the baseline and MR08 systems
