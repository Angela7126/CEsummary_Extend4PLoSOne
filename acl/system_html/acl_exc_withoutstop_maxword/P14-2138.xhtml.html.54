<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The remaining bigrams indicate function words, toponymic terms like Germany , and frequent content words like take and new</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, if we train the classifier using words as features, with values representing their frequency relative to the length of the document, the features corresponding to the word China might receive the following weights</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We conclude that character bigrams are effective in determining L1 of the author because they reflect differences in L2 word usage that are unrelated to the phonology of L1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the fact that the two bigrams are also on the list for the I2 set, which does not include these languages, suggests that their importance is mostly due to the function words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We replicate the experiments of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) by limiting the features to the 200 most frequent character bigrams</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As the orthography of alphabetic languages is at least partially representative of the underlying phonology, character bigrams may capture these phonological preferences</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The authors propose the following hypothesis to explain this finding u'\u201c' the choice of words [emphasis added] people make when writing in a second language is strongly influenced by the phonology of their native language u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, we limit the set of features to the 200 most frequent bigrams for the sake of consistency with previous work</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using Algorithm 2 , we identify the top 20 character bigrams, and replace them with randomly selected bigrams</a>
