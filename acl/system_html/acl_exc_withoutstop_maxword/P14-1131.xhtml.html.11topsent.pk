VThe cosine of two PPR vectors can be used as a similarity measure for the corresponding nodes [ 12 , 1 ]
p1
aVCoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u005cu2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes
p2
aVUnfortunately, SimRank has time complexity u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaa' u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) (where n is the number of nodes in the graph) and therefore does not scale to the large graphs that are typical of NLP
p3
aVThe extension of CoSimRank to similarity across graphs is important for the application of bilingual lexicon extraction given a set of correspondences between nodes in two graphs A and B (corresponding to two different languages), a pair of nodes ( a u'\u005cu2208' A , b u'\u005cu2208' B ) is a good
