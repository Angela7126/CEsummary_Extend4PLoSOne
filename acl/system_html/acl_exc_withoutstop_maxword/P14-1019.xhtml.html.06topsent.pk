VIf the walk hits the current tree, the walk path is added to form a new tree with more nodes
p1
aVOne such sampling algorithm is the random walk sampler of Wilson ( 1996
p2
aVFinally, we extend our model to a joint parsing and POS correction task
p3
aVIdeally, we would change multiple heads in the parse tree simultaneously, and sample those choices from the corresponding conditional distribution of p
p4
aVStarting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse

aVThe general structure of our sampling algorithm is given in Figure 1
p9
aVThe algorithm in Wilson ( 1996 ) iterates over all the nodes, and for each node performs a random walk
