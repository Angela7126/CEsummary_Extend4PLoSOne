aVUltimately, we want to use structured annotations for supervised training, where annotation quality influences model performance on held-out test data
p3
aVNote that while we report agreement between the crowdsourced annotations and the crowdsourced annotations, our main evaluations are based on models learned from expert vs. crowdsourced annotations and downstream applications thereof (chunking and NER
