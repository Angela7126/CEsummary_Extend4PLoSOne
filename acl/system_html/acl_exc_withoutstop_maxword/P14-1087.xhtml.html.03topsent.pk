VT u'\u005cu2062' S w is the number of events within the time span
p1
aVLet T u'\u005cu2062' S L be the time span with the largest number of events in a timeline
p2
aVReferring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall
p3
aVThe importance of a time span T u'\u005cu2062' S i is computed by normalizing the number of events in T u'\u005cu2062' S i against the number of events in T u'\u005cu2062' S L
p4
aVIn Figure 5 , the sentences describe many events which took place within the same time span
p5
aVTwo events are said to be in the same time span if one happens within the time period the other happens in
p6
aVFormally, if a sentence s contains events u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudd3c' s = { e 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , e n } , where each event is associated with a time span T u'\u005cu2062' S i , then T u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' D is computed using
p7
aV1) temporal processing, and 2) summarization
p8
aVAssigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone
p9
aVSuppose a sentence contains events which are associated with time spans T u'\u005cu2062' S a
