VWe then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4
p1
aVMoreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary
p2
aVA hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary
p3
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering
p4
aVUsers navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused
p5
aVA user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary
p6
aVIn hierarchical summarization, however, a cluster summary may span hundreds of documents and a wide range of information
