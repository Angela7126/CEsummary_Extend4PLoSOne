<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Unlike existing KB-QA systems which treat semantic parsing and answer retrieval as two cascaded tasks, this paper presents a unified framework that can integrate semantic parsing into the question answering procedure directly</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For this example, we can give all book names where Sherlock Holmes appeared in, but we cannot rank them based on their publication date , as we cannot learn the alignment between the constraint word first occurred in the question</a>
