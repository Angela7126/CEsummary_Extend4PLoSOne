VThis undirected tree is converted into a directed tree by applying h dir
p1
aVAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p2
aVThis means our decoder first identifies (given a POS sequence) an undirected tree, and then orients it by applying h dir on the resulting tree (see below
p3
aVUnlike in phylogenetics and graphical models, where a single latent tree is constructed for all the data, in our case, each part of speech sequence is associated with its own parse tree
p4
aVHowever, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more
