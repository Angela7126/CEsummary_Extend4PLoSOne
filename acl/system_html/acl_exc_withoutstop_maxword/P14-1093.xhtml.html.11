<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The samples were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who were instructed to regard a sample as acceptable if each event causality that constitutes it is plausible and the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent story</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u2192' B u'\u2192' C from A u'\u2192' B and B u'\u2192' C</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Its relation to event causality might seem unclear, but a material can be seen as a u'\u201c' cause u'\u201d' of a product</a>
