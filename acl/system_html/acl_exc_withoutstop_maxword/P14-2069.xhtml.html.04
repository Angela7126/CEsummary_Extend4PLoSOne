<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As an easy observation, the emotion lexicon generated by the EaLDA model consistently and significantly outperforms the WordNet-Affect emotion lexicon and other three emotion classification systems</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1) we perform a case study for the lexicon generated by our algorithm, and (2) we compare the results of solving emotion classification task using our lexicon against different methods, and demonstrate the advantage of our lexicon over other lexicons and other emotion classification systems</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For each emotion category and each text, we compare the number of words within this emotion category, and the average number of words within other emotion categories, to output a binary prediction of 1 or 0</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Usually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We compare the performance between a popular emotion</a>
