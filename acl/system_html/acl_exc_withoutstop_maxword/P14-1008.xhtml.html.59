<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On-the-fly knowledge is generated by aligning paths in DCS trees</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on abstract denotations, we briefly describe our process to apply DCS to textual inference</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To formulate the database querying process defined by a DCS tree, we provide formal semantics to DCS trees by employing relational algebra [] for representing the query</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Furthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by transformed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are preserved in Figure 6 , though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule u'\u201c' X is blamed for death u'\u2192' X causes loss of life u'\u201d' , the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since meanings of sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations, logical inference among sentences is reduced to deriving new relations among abstract denotations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We built an inference engine to perform logical inference on abstract denotations as above</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Most of the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system without on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal semantics</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Technically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values [] of that variable</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Abstract denotations and statements are convenient for representing semantics of various types of expressions and linguistic knowledge</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, Figure 5 shows DCS trees of the following sentences (a simplified pair from RTE2-dev</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Accepted aligned paths are converted into statements, which are used as new knowledge</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Our solution is to redefine DCS trees without the aid of any databases, by considering each node of a DCS tree as a content word in a sentence (but may no longer be a table in a specific database), while each edge represents semantic relations between two words</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As described below, we represent meanings of sentences with abstract denotations , and logical relations among sentences are computed as relations among their abstract denotations</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Two paths are aligned if the joined germs are aligned, and we impose constraints on aligned germs to inhibit meaningless alignments, as described below</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The logical clue to align germs is if there exists an abstract denotation, other than W , that is a superset of both abstract denotations of two germs, then the two germs can be aligned</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The abstract denotation of a germ is defined in a top-down manner for the root node u'\u03a1' of a DCS tree u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' , we define its denotation [[ u'\u03a1' ]] u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' as the denotation of the entire tree [[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ]] ; for a non-root node u'\u03a4' and its parent node u'\u03a3' , let the edge ( u'\u03a3' , u'\u03a4' ) be labeled by semantic roles ( r , r u'\u2032' ) , then define</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>For example, the similarity score of the path alignment u'\u201c' OBJ ( blame ) IOBJ - ARG ( death ) u'\u2248' SUBJ ( cause ) OBJ - ARG ( loss ) MOD - ARG ( life ) u'\u201d' is calculated as the cosine similarity of vectors blame + death and cause + loss + life</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>However, this method does not work for real-world datasets such as PASCAL RTE [] , because of the knowledge bottleneck it is often the case that the lack of sufficient linguistic knowledge causes failure of inference, thus the system outputs u'\u201c' no entailment u'\u201d' for almost all pairs []</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>On PASCAL RTE datasets, strict logical inference is known to have very low recall [] , so on-the-fly</a>
