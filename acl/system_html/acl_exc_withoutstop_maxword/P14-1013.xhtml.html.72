<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Deep learning has also been successfully applied in a variety of NLP tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, semantic role labeling [ 8 ] , parsing [ 28 ] , sentiment analysis [ 29 ] , etc</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Followed by fine-tuning in this parameter region, deep learning is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various research areas, including breakthrough results on the ImageNet dataset for objective recognition [ 19 ] , significant error reduction in speech recognition [ 10 ] , etc</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also thank Fei Huang (BBN), Nan Yang, Yajuan Duan, Hong Sun and Duyu Tang for the helpful discussions</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The results confirm that topic information is indispensable for SMT since both [ 34 ] and our neural network based method significantly outperforms the baseline system</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since the information within the sentence is insufficient for topic modeling,</a>
