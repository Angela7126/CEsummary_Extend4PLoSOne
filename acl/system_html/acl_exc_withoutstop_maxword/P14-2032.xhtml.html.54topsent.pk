VA powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time

aV\u005cnewcite Sun:2010:COLING details their respective theoretical strengths character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new oov words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans

aVDual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]
