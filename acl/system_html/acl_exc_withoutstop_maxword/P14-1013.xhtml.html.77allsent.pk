VTo incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space
p1
aVBy measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates
p2
aVSince the vectors from DAE are trained using information from monolingual training data independently, these vectors may be inadequate to measure bilingual topic similarity due to their different topic spaces
p3
aVThis dense representation should preserve the information from the bag-of-words input, meanwhile alleviate data sparse problem
p4
aVTherefore, it helps to train a smarter translation model with the embedded topic information
p5
aVSince a parallel sentence pair should have the same topic, our goal is to maximize the similarity score between the source sentence and target sentence
p6
aVOur problem fits well into the neural network framework and we expect that it can further improve inferring the topic representations for sentences
p7
aVWe directly optimized bilingual topic similarity in the deep learning framework with the help of sentence-level parallel data, so that the learned representation could be easily used in SMT decoding procedure
p8
aVThis is not simply coincidence since we can interpret their approach as a special case in our neural network method when a parallel sentence pair has document-level information, that document will be retrieved for training; otherwise, the most relevant document will be retrieved from the monolingual data
p9
aVTherefore, it is important to leverage topic information to learn smarter translation models and achieve better translation performance
p10
aVIn the pre-training phase, all parallel data is fed into two neural networks respectively for DAE training, where network parameters W and b are randomly initialized
p11
aVNeural network is an effective technique for learning different levels of data representations
p12
aVThen, in the fine-tuning phase (Section 3.2), our model directly optimizes the similarity of two low-dimensional representations, so that it highly correlates to SMT decoding
p13
aVIrrelevant documents bring so many unrelated topic words hence degrade neural network learning performance
p14
aVThe results confirm that topic information is indispensable for SMT since both [ 34 ] and our neural network based method significantly outperforms the baseline system
p15
aVThe similarity scores are integrated into the standard log-linear model for making translation decisions
p16
aVTherefore, in this stage, parallel sentence pairs are used to help connecting the vectors from different languages because they express the same topic
p17
aVSince the information within the sentence is insufficient for topic modeling, we first enrich sentence contexts via Information Retrieval (IR) methods using content words in the sentence as queries, so that topic-related monolingual documents can be collected
p18
aVConsequently, the whole neural network can be fine-tuned towards the supervised criteria with the help of parallel data
p19
aVAs more documents are retrieved, less relevant information is also used to train the neural networks
p20
aVThe decoding process consists of a linear layer and a non-linear layer with similar network structures, but different parameters
p21
aVWe proposed a more general approach to leveraging topic information for SMT by using IR methods to get a collection of related documents, regardless of whether or not document boundaries are explicitly given
p22
aVTherefore, adding topic-related features is able to keep the topic consistency and substantially improve the translation accuracy
p23
aVInspired by the contrastive estimation method [ 27 ] , for each parallel sentence pair u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' as a positive instance, we select another sentence pair u'\u005cu27e8' f u'\u005cu2032' , e u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu27e9' from the training data and treat u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu27e9' as a negative instance
p24
aVSince some of our parallel data does not have document-level information, we rely on the IR method to retrieve the most relevant document and simulate this approach
p25
aVBecause topic-specific rules usually have a larger sensitivity score, they can beat general rules when they obtain the same similarity score against the input sentence
p26
aVLimited training data prevents the model from getting close to the global optimum
p27
aVThe similarity score of the representation pair u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' f , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' e u'\u005cu27e9' is defined as the cosine similarity of the two vectors
p28
aVAssuming that the input is a n -of- V binary vector x representing the bag-of-words ( V is the vocabulary size), an auto-encoder consists of an encoding process g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ) and a decoding process h u'\u005cu2062' ( g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' )
p29
aVWe then take two vectors as the input to calculate their similarity
p30
aVThe topic representation of u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0391' , u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu27e9' is then calculated as the weighted average
p31
aVTopic-related rules are selected according to distributional similarity with the source text, which helps hypotheses generation in SMT decoding
p32
aVThe main reason is that parameters in the neural networks are too many to be effectively trained
p33
aVIn addition, contemporary SMT systems often works on sentence level rather than document level due to the efficiency
p34
aVIn this section, we explain our neural network based topic similarity model in detail, as well as how to incorporate the topic similarity features into SMT decoding procedure
p35
aVGiven a parallel sentence pair u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' , the DAE learns representations for f and e respectively, as u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' f = g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' ) and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' e = g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1e' ) in Figure 1
p36
aVTherefore, we need to devise a systematical approach to enriching the sentence and inferring its topic more accurately
p37
aVSince different sentences may have very similar topic distributions, we select negative instances that are dissimilar with the positive instances based on the following criteria
p38
aVThe similarity scores indicate that u'\u005cu201c' deliver X u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' distribute X u'\u005cu201d' are more appropriate to translate the sentence
p39
aVTherefore, the model is likely to fall in local optima and lead to unacceptable representations
p40
aVAs shown in Figure 3 , the translation accuracy is better when L is relatively small
p41
aVMulti-layer neural networks are trained with the standard back-propagation algorithm [ 26 ]
p42
aVWe also consider the topic sensitivity estimation since general rules have flatter distributions while topic-specific rules have sharper distributions
p43
aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' denotes all instances for the rule u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0391' , u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu27e9' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' u'\u005cu0391' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' u'\u005cu0393' are the source-side and target-side topic vectors respectively
p44
aVWhen a synchronous rule u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0391' , u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu27e9' is extracted from a sentence pair u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' , a triple instance u'\u005cu2110' = ( u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0391' , u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu27e9' , u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' , c ) is collected for inferring the topic representation of u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0391' , u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu27e9' , where c is the count of rule occurrence
p45
aVThe advantage of our method is that it is applicable to both sentence-level and document-level SMT, since we do not place any restrictions on the input
p46
aVTo minimize reconstruction error with respect to u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ , we define the loss function as the L2-norm of the difference between the uncorrupted input and reconstructed input
p47
aVWith DAE, the input x is manually corrupted by applying masking noise (randomly mask 1 to 0) and getting u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~
p48
aVAlthough the translation probability of u'\u005cu201c' send X u'\u005cu201d' is much higher, it is inappropriate in this context since it is usually used in IT texts
p49
aVAs we know when L =1000, there are a total of 100 , 000 × 1 , 000 parameters between the linear and non-linear layers in the network
p50
aVTopic modeling is a useful mechanism for discovering and characterizing various semantic concepts embedded in a collection of documents
p51
aVHowever, when L equals 1,000, the translation accuracy is inferior to other settings
p52
aVThe phrase pairs that appear only once in the parallel data are discarded because most of them are noisy
p53
aVTherefore, our method can be viewed as a more general framework than previous LDA-based approaches
p54
aVAssuming that the dimension of the g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ ) is L , the linear layer forms a L × V matrix W which projects the n -of- V vector to a L -dimensional hidden layer
p55
aVTherefore, we use a specially designed mechanism called auto-encoder to solve this problem
p56
aVThis is done by corrupting the initial input x to get a partially destroyed version u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~
p57
aVThe vocabulary size for the input layer is 100,000, and we choose different lengths for the hidden layer as L = { 100 , 300 , 600 , 1000 } in the experiments
p58
aVWe evaluate the performance of our neural network based topic similarity model on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task
p59
aVHowever, we find that as N becomes larger in the experiments, e.g., N =50, the translation accuracy drops drastically
p60
aVFor example, in IT related texts, if the word driver is masked, it should be predicted through hidden units in neural networks by active signals such as u'\u005cu201c' buffer u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' user response u'\u005cu201d' , etc
p61
aVThe parallel data we use is released by LDC 3 3 LDC2003E14, LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2005T06, LDC2005T10, LDC2005E83, LDC2006E34, LDC2006E85, LDC2006E92, LDC2006E26, LDC2007T09
p62
aVThe learned neural networks are used to obtain sentence topic representations, which will be further leveraged to infer topic representations of bilingual translation rules
p63
aVHowever, this situation does not always happen since there is considerable amount of parallel data which does not have document boundaries
p64
aVThe CKY decoding algorithm is used and cube pruning is performed with the same default parameter settings as in Chiang ( 2007
p65
aVThis makes previous approaches inefficient when applied them in real-world commercial SMT systems
p66
aVAdditionally, our model can be discriminatively trained with a large number of training instances, without expensive sampling methods such as in LDA or HTMM, thus it is more practicable and scalable
p67
aVIn our work, a novel neural network based approach is proposed to infer topic representations for parallel data
p68
aVIn this work, we use the rectifier function as our non-linear function due to its efficiency and better performance [ 13 ]
p69
aVFinally, the learned representation is used to calculate similarities which are integrated as features in SMT decoding procedure (Section 3.3
p70
aVThese topic-related documents are utilized to learn a specific topic representation for each sentence using a neural network based approach
p71
aVThis proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates
p72
aVWe incorporate the learned topic similarity scores into the standard log-linear framework for SMT
p73
aVWe integrate topic similarity features in the log-linear model and evaluate the performance on the NIST Chinese-to-English translation task
p74
aVThe topic similarity is calculated on top of the learned dense vectors
p75
aVIn deep learning, this parameter is often empirically tuned with human efforts
p76
aVThis underlying topic space is learned from sentence-level parallel data in order to share topic information across the source and target languages as much as possible
p77
aVSpecifically, the ranking model we used is a Vector Space Model (VSM), where the query and document are converted into tf-idf weighted vectors
p78
aVDenoising training is considered as u'\u005cu201c' filling in the blanks u'\u005cu201d' [ 33 ] , which means the masking components can be recovered from the non-corrupted components
p79
aVIn addition, our method directly maximizes the similarity between parallel sentence pairs, which is ideal for SMT decoding
p80
aVFurthermore, rule sensitivity features improve SMT performance compared with only using similarity features
p81
aVIn neural network training, a large number of monolingual documents are collected in both source and target languages
p82
aVAttempts on topic-based translation modeling include topic-specific lexicon translation models [ 37 , 38 ] , topic similarity models for synchronous rules [ 34 ] , and document-level translation with topic coherence [ 36 ]
p83
aVFigure 1 sketches the high-level overview which illustrates how to learn topic representations using sentence-level parallel data
p84
aVIn this way, the topic of a sentence can be inferred with document-level information using off-the-shelf topic modeling toolkits such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] or Hidden Topic Markov Model (HTMM) [ 14 ]
p85
aVThey incorporated the bilingual topic information into language model adaptation and lexicon translation model adaptation, achieving significant improvements in the large-scale evaluation
p86
aVThis shared topic space is particularly useful when the SMT decoder tries to match the source texts and translation candidates in the target language
p87
aV2007 ) used bilingual LSA to learn latent topic distributions across different languages and enforce one-to-one topic correspondence during model training
p88
aVInspired by previous successful research, we first learn sentence representations using topic-related monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then optimize the bilingual similarity by leveraging sentence-level parallel data in the fine-tuning phase
p89
aVFinally, we associate the learned representation to each bilingual translation rule
p90
aVTopic-related features rule similarity scores (2 features), rule sensitivity scores (2 features
p91
aVIn the pre-training phase (Section 3.1), we build two neural networks with the same structure but different parameters to learn a low-dimensional representation for sentences in two different languages
p92
aVIn the pre-training phase, we leverage neural network structures to transform high-dimensional sparse vectors to low-dimensional dense vectors
p93
aVWe used neural networks to learn topic representations more accurately, with more practicable and scalable modeling techniques
p94
aV2013 ) proposed using vector space model for adaptation where genre resemblance is leveraged to improve translation accuracy
p95
aVIn the fine-tuning phase, we stack another layer on top of the two low-dimensional vectors to maximize the similarity between source and target languages
p96
aVThese training instances are leveraged to optimize the similarity of two vectors
p97
aVStandard features
p98
aVFollowing this work, [ 34 ] extended topic-specific lexicon translation models to hierarchical phrase-based translation models, where the topic information of synchronous rules was directly inferred with the help of document-level information
p99
aVMaking translation decisions is a difficult task in many Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems
p100
aVIn our task, for each sentence, we treat the retrieved N relevant documents as a single large document and convert it to a bag-of-words vector x in Figure 2
p101
aVIn the fine-tuning phase, for each parallel sentence pair, we randomly select other ten sentence pairs which satisfy the criterion as negative instances
p102
aVIn contrast, with our neural network based approach, the learned topic distributions of u'\u005cu201c' deliver X u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' distribute X u'\u005cu201d' are more similar with the input sentence than u'\u005cu201c' send X u'\u005cu201d' , which is shown in Figure 4
p103
aVThere are two phases in our neural network training process pre-training and fine-tuning
p104
aVWe evaluate the performance of adding new topic-related features to the log-linear model and compare the translation accuracy with the method in [ 34 ]
p105
aVIn this case, people understand the meaning because of the IT topical context which goes beyond sentence-level analysis and requires more relevant knowledge
p106
aVGiven a parallel sentence pair u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' , the first step is to treat f and e as queries, and use IR methods to retrieve relevant documents to enrich contextual information for them
p107
aVCurrent translation modeling approaches usually use context dependent information to disambiguate translation candidates
p108
aVIn addition to traditional SMT features, we add new topic-related features into the standard log-linear framework
p109
aVIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning topic representations for sentences
p110
aVCompared to document-level topic modeling which uses the topic of a document for all sentences within the document [ 34 ] , our contributions are
p111
aVTopic modeling was first leveraged to improve SMT performance in [ 37 , 38 ]
p112
aVThey estimated phrase-topic distributions in translation model adaptation and generated better translation quality
p113
aVTranslation model, including translation probabilities and lexical weights for both directions (4 features), 5-gram language model (1 feature), word count (1 feature), phrase count (1 feature), NULL penalty (1 feature), number of hierarchical rules used (1 feature
p114
aVAlthough we can easily apply LDA at the sentence level, it is quite difficult to infer the topic accurately with only a few words in the sentence
p115
aVTraining neural networks involves many factors such as the learning rate and the length of hidden layers
p116
aVThe model minimizes the pairwise ranking loss across all training instances
p117
aV[ 30 ] investigated the relationship between out-of-domain bilingual data and in-domain monolingual data via topic mapping using HTMM methods
p118
aVThis confirms that enriching the source text with topic-related documents is very useful in determining topic representations, thereby help to guide the synchronous rule selection
p119
aVIn [ 34 ] , the topic of each sentence pair is exactly the same as the document it belongs to
p120
aVAnother direction of approaches leveraged topic modeling techniques for domain adaptation
p121
aVWe implement a distributed framework to speed up the training process of neural networks
p122
aVGiven a source sentence s to be translated, we define the similarity as follows
p123
aVThe most relevant N documents u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1d' f and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1d' e are retrieved and converted to a high-dimensional, bag-of-words input f and e for the representation learning 1 1 We use f and e to denote the n -of- V vector converted from the retrieved documents
p124
aVAn example of translation rule disambiguation for a sentence from the NIST 2005 dataset is shown in Figure 4
p125
aVThe levels inferred from neural network correspond to distinct levels of concepts, where high-level representations are obtained from low-level bag-of-words input
p126
aVExperimental results demonstrate that our model significantly improves translation accuracy over a state-of-the-art baseline
p127
aVOur goal is to learn a low-dimensional vector which can preserve information from the original n -of- V vector
p128
aVIn SMT training, an in-house hierarchical phrase-based SMT decoder is implemented for our experiments
p129
aVWe also investigated multi-domain adaptation where explicit topic information is used to train domain specific models [ 9 ]
p130
aVWe used standard back-propagation algorithm to further fine-tune the neural network parameters W and b in Equation (1
p131
aVWe illustrate the relationship among translation accuracy (BLEU), the number of retrieved documents ( N ) and the length of hidden layers ( L ) on different testing datasets
p132
aVTo effectively train the model in this task, negative instances must be selected carefully
p133
aVFor example, translation sense disambiguation approaches [ 4 , 5 ] are proposed for phrase-based SMT systems
p134
aVTo make different methods comparable, we set the dimension of topic representation as 100 for all settings
p135
aVFor the SMT system, the best translation candidate e ^ is given by
p136
aVAfter the bag-of-words input has been transformed, they are fed into a subsequent layer to model the highly non-linear relations among words
p137
aVThe training procedure often involves two phases a layer-wise unsupervised pre-training phase and a supervised fine-tuning phase
p138
aVIn fact, the objective of fine-tuning is to discover a latent topic space which is shared by both languages as much as possible
p139
aVGenerally, most previous research has leveraged conventional topic modeling techniques such as LDA or HTMM
p140
aVExperiments show that their approach not only achieved better translation performance but also provided a faster decoding speed compared with previous lexicon-based LDA methods
p141
aVIt is able to detect correlations among any subset of input features through non-linear transformations, which demonstrates the superiority of eliminating the effect of noisy words which are irrelevant to the topic
p142
aV2008 ) proposed the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE), which aims to reconstruct a clean, u'\u005cu201c' repaired u'\u005cu201d' input from a corrupted, partially destroyed vector
p143
aVTo make the similarity of the positive instance larger than the negative instance by some margin u'\u005cu0397' , we utilize the following pairwise ranking loss
p144
aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' s is the topic representation of s
p145
aVThe network is learned with mini-batch asynchronous gradient descent with the adaptive learning rate procedure called AdaGrad [ 11 ]
p146
aVOne typical property of these approaches in common is that they only utilize parallel data where document boundaries are explicitly given
p147
aVUnsupervised pre-training trains the network one layer at a time and helps guide the parameters of the layer towards better regions in parameter space [ 2 ]
p148
aVThis low-dimensional representation is usually learned from huge amount of monolingual texts in the pre-training phase, and then fine-tuned towards task-specific criterion
p149
aVWe observe that source-side similarity is more effective than target-side similarity, but their contributions are cumulative
p150
aVThe gradient of the loss function is calculated and back-propagated to the previous layer to update its parameters
p151
aVThe representation learned by auto-encoders tends to be influenced by the function words, thereby it is not robust
p152
aVFinally, when all new features are integrated, the performance is the best, preforming substantially better than [ 34 ] with 0.39 BLEU points on average
p153
aVTranslation models are trained over the parallel data that is automatically word-aligned using GIZA++ in both directions, and the diag-grow-final heuristic is used to refine symmetric word alignment
p154
aVThe English monolingual data used for language modeling is the same as in Table 1
p155
aVWe find that the topic of this sentence is about u'\u005cu201c' rescue after a natural disaster u'\u005cu201d'
p156
aVThese documents are built in the format of inverted index using Lucene 2 2 http://lucene.apache.org/ , which can be efficiently retrieved by the parallel sentence pairs
p157
aVAlthough these methods are effective and proven successful in many SMT systems, they only leverage within-sentence contexts which are insufficient in exploring broader information
p158
aVWe use 32 model replicas in each iteration during the training
p159
aVIf we cannot find such e u'\u005cu2032' , remove u'\u005cu27e8' f , e u'\u005cu27e9' from the training instances for network learning
p160
aVDeep learning is an active topic in recent years which has triumphed in many machine learning research areas
p161
aVThis implementation makes the system perform much better and the translation model size is much smaller
p162
aVOne problem with auto-encoder is that it treats all words in the same way, making no distinguishment between function words and content words
p163
aVDAE is capable of capturing the global structure of the input while ignoring the noise
p164
aVIn our case, the encoding process transforms the corrupted input u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ into g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ ) with two layers a linear layer connected with a non-linear layer
p165
aVAn in-house language modeling toolkit is used to train the 5-gram language model with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing [ 17 ]
p166
aVThe similarity calculated against u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' u'\u005cu0391' or u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' u'\u005cu0393' denotes the source-to-source or the source-to-target similarity
p167
aVThey proposed a bilingual topical admixture approach for word alignment and assumed that each word-pair follows a topic-specific model
p168
aVwhere z is the output of the non-linear layer, b is a L -length bias vector f u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is a non-linear function, where common choices include sigmoid function, hyperbolic function, u'\u005cu201c' hard u'\u005cu201d' hyperbolic function, rectifier function, etc
p169
aVIn this section, we give a case study to explain why our method works
p170
aVWe will discuss the optimization of these parameters in Section 4
p171
aVMost NLP research converts a high-dimensional and sparse binary representation into a low-dimensional and real-valued representation
p172
aVMost of them also assume that the input must be in document level
p173
aVIn addition, topic-based approaches have been used in domain adaptation for SMT [ 31 , 30 ] , where they view different topics as different domains
p174
aVTable 2 shows how the accuracy is improved with more features added
p175
aVwhere the translation probability is given by
p176
aVThe PLDA toolkit [ 22 ] is used to infer topic distributions, which takes 34.5 hours to finish
p177
aVAnother important factor is the length of hidden layers L in the network
p178
aVThis technique began raising public awareness in the mid-2000s after researchers showed how a multi-layer feed-forward neural network can be effectively trained
p179
aVThey reported extensive empirical analysis and improved word alignment accuracy as well as translation quality
p180
aVTo alleviate this problem, Vincent et al
p181
aVThe best translation accuracy is achieved when N =10 for most settings
p182
aVThe model parameters are averaged after each iteration and sent to each replica for the next iteration
p183
aVMeanwhile, for hierarchical phrase-based or syntax-based SMT systems, there is also much work involving rich contexts to guide rule selection [ 15 , 21 , 23 , 35 ]
p184
aVThe total data statistics are presented in Table 1
p185
aVIn addition, we also collect weblog documents with a variety of topics from the web
p186
aVBut in the sentence u'\u005cu201c' Finally, we write the user response to the buffer, i.e.,, pass it to our driver u'\u005cu201d' , we understand that driver means u'\u005cu201c' computer program u'\u005cu201d'
p187
aVThe NIST 2003 dataset is the development data
p188
aVIn total, the datasets contain nearly 1.1 million sentence pairs
p189
aVFollowing [ 7 ] , we give a count of one for each phrase pair occurrence and a fractional count for each hierarchical phrase pair
p190
aVThis takes 10 hours in pre-training phase and 22 hours in fine-tuning phase
p191
aVThe documents are mainly from two domains news and weblog
p192
aVThe larger the sensitivity is, the more topic-specific the rule manifests
p193
aVWe compare our method with the LDA-based approach proposed by Xiao et al
p194
aVThe results are shown in Figure 3
p195
aVThe evaluation metric for the overall translation quality is case-insensitive BLEU4 [ 25 ]
p196
