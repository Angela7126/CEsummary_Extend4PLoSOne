<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our string transduction model works by learning the sequence of edits which transform the input string into the output string</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The principal contributions of our work are i) we show that a discriminative sequence labeling model is apt for text normalization and performs at state-of-the-art levels with small amounts of labeled training data; (ii) we show that character-level neural text embeddings can be used to effectively incorporate information from unlabeled data into the model and can substantially boost text normalization performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When run on new strings, the activations of the units in the hidden layer at each position in the string are recorded and used as features for training the string transduction model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The training data for the model is generated by computing shortest edit scripts for pairs of original and normalized strings</a>
