<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>SimRank is at a disadvantage because it computes all similarities in the graph regardless of the size of the test set; it is particularly inefficient on synonym extraction because the English graph contains a large number of edges (see Table 1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two</a>
