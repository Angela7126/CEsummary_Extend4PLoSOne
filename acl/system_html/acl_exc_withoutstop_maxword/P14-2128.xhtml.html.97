<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Such properties are used as additional features to guide the parser to construct the dependency graph</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The fact that most previous work evaluates parsing accuracies without taking punctuations into account is also largely due to this reason</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By inspecting the parser outputs, we found that error propagation caused by assigning incorrect head to punctuations is one of the main reason that leads to this result</a>
