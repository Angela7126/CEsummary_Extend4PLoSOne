VIn this comparison, items where both fluency and adequacy were affected were counted as adequacy cases
p1
aVThe table also shows that differences in the order of VP constituents usually led to a change in adequacy or fluency, as did ordering changes within NPs, with noun-noun compounds and named entities as the most frequent subcategories of NP-ordering changes
p2
aVIn this analysis, we consider whether the reranked realization improves upon or detracts from realization quality u'\u005cu2014' in terms of adequacy, fluency, both or neither u'\u005cu2014' along with a linguistic categorization of the differences between the reranked realization and the original top-ranked realization according to the averaged perceptron model
p3
aVFinally, wsj_0044.111 is an example where a subject-inversion makes no difference to adequacy or fluency
p4
aVWith wsj_0041.18, the SVM ranker unfortunately prefers a realization where presumably seems to modify shows rather than of two politicians as in the original, which the averaged perceptron model prefers
p5
aVSimilarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer u'\u005cu2019' s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker
p6
aVIn order to gain a better understanding of the successes and failures of our SVM ranker, we present here a targeted manual analysis of the development set sentences with the greatest change in BLEU scores, carried out by the second author (a native speaker
p7
aVIn sum, although simple ranking helps to avoid vicious ambiguity in some cases, the overall results of simple ranking are no better than the perceptron model (according to BLEU, at least), as parse failures that are not reflective of human intepretive tendencies too often lead the ranker to choose dispreferred realizations
p8
aVSimple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u005cu2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07,
