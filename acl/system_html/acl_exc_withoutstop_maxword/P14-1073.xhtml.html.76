<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To select a parent for a mention x of type t = x e t , a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and u'\u2662' is selected with probability proportional to u'\u0391' t 0</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The entire corpus, including these entities, is generated according to standard topic model assumptions; we first generate a topic distribution for a document, then sample topics and words for the document [ ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The tuned model then produced a mention clustering on the full political blog corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, for fixed values of the non-mention tokens and their topics, the probability of generating the mention sequence u'\ud835' u'\udc99' is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the choices</a>
