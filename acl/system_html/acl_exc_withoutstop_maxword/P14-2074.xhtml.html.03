<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this paper we estimate the correlation of human judgements with five automatic evaluation measures on two image description data sets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We estimate Spearman u'\u2019' s u'\u03a1' for five different automatic evaluation measures against human judgements for the automatic image description task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>bleu measures the effective overlap between a reference sentence X and a candidate sentence Y</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The sentence-level evaluation measures were calculated for each image u'\u2013' description u'\u2013' reference tuple</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>ter measures the number of modifications a human would need to make to transform a candidate Y into a reference X</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>An analysis of the distribution of ter scores in Figure 2 (a) shows that differences in candidate and reference length are prevalent in the image description task</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The main finding of our analysis is that ter and unigram bleu are weakly correlated against human judgements, rouge-su4 and Smoothed bleu are moderately correlated, and the strongest correlation is found with Meteor</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We failed to find significant correlations between grammatlicality judgements and any of the automatic measures on the Elliott and Keller ( 2013 ) data</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Smoothed bleu and rouge-su4 are moderately correlated with human judgements, and the correlation is stronger than with unigram bleu</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The test data of Elliott and Keller ( 2013 ) contains 101 images paired with three reference descriptions</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The images were retrieved from Flickr, the reference descriptions were collected from Mechanical Turk, and the human judgements were collected from</a>
