<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using the probabilistic parser, we benchmark and conduct systematic comparisons among ours and all previous bootstrapping methods, including self/co/tri-training</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, noise in unlabeled data is largely alleviated, since parse forest encodes only a few highly possible parse trees with high oracle score</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The key idea is the use of ambiguous labelings for the purpose of aggregating multiple 1-best parse trees produced by several diverse parsers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Especially, the unlabeled data with highly divergent structures leads to slightly higher improvement</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally, with sufficient unlabeled data, it is possible that the parser can learn to resolve such uncertainty by biasing to more reasonable parse trees</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Here, u'\u201c' ambiguous labelings u'\u201d' mean an unlabeled sentence may have multiple parse trees as gold-standard reference, represented by parse forest (see Figure 1</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this way, the auto-parsed unlabeled data becomes more reliable</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This kind of syntactic divergence is helpful because it can provide complementary knowledge from a different perspective also show that the diversity of parsers is important for performance improvement when integrating different parsers in the supervised track</a>
