<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We denote the frames that associate with u'\u2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u2113'</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Consequently, the Wsabie Embedding model can share more information between different examples in the training data than the Log-Linear Embedding model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So the second baseline has the same input representation as Wsabie Embedding but uses a log-linear model instead of Wsabie</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The second baseline, tries to decouple the Wsabie training from the embedding input, and trains a log linear model using the embeddings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The model computes a composed representation of the predicate instance by using distributed vector representations for words (3) u'\u2013' the (red) vertical embedding vectors for each word are concatenated into a long vector</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described</a>
