<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Following the evaluation methodology used in the medical record track, we use MAP@1000 as the primary measure for Med11 and also report bpref</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a result, directly applying existing weighting strategies might lead to non-optimal retrieval performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect u'\u201c' children u'\u201d' is mapped to 2 concepts while u'\u201c' dental caries u'\u201d' is mapped to 3 concepts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>S u'\u2062' ( Q , D ) is the relevance score of D with respect to Q e i denotes a concept, and u'\ud835' u'\udc9c' u'\u2062' ( e ) denotes the query aspect associated with e , i.e.,, a set of concepts that are mapped to the same phrases as e by using MetaMap i u'\u2062' ( e ) is the normalized confidence score of the mapping for concept e generated by MetaMap c u'\u2062' ( e , D ) denotes the occurrences of concept e in document D , d u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' ( e ) denotes the number of documents containing e</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Existing studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores</a>
