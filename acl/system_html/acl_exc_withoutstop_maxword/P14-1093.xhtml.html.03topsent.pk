VThis section describes our event causality extraction method
p1
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method
p2
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p3
aVThey ranked event causality candidates by C u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1
p4
aVDo et al used it (along with discourse relations) to extract event causality
p5
aVSection 3.3 shows how to rank event causality candidates
p6
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1
