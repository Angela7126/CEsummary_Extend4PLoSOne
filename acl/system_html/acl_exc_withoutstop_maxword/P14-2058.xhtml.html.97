<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Interestingly, there is a strong correlation (Pearson u'\u2019' s r = 0.85 ) between the difficulty of the words in each group (measured as the error rate on rote memorization) and the positive contribution of the generated sentences to the learning process</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Finally, the relative error rate reduction % e is calculated as the the ratio between the absolute error rate reduction u'\u0394' u'\u2062' e and the error rate of rote memorization e R , i.e</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Similarly, groups A2 and B1 are of average difficulty, whereas group B2 appears to be the most difficult, with an error rate higher than 22% when using only rote memorization</a>
