VIn this paper, we focus on the visit-level relevance because of its simplicity
p1
aVSince each visit can be associated with multiple medical records, the relevance of a visit is related to the relevance of individual associated medical records
p2
aVSince the task is to retrieve relevant visits, we merged all the records from a visit to form a single document for the visit, which leads to 17,198 documents in the collection
p3
aVIn particular, given a patient u'\u005cu2019' s visit, all the medical records generated from this visit are merged as a document
p4
aVExisting studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores as the relevance score of a visit [ 15 , 30 , 12 ]
p5
aVWith the increasing use of electronic health records, it becomes urgent to leverage this rich information resource about patients u'\u005cu2019' health conditions to transform research in health and medicine
p6
aVIn particular, MetaMap is used to map terms from queries and documents (e.g.,, medical records) to the semantic concepts from biomedical knowledge bases such as UMLS
p7
aVSince the goal is to retrieve medical records of patients that satisfying requirements specified in a query, the relevance of medical records should be modeled based on how well
