<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The ANOVA indicates that the number of connectives is not a significant factor for Arabic translation, but significantly impacts Chinese translation quality</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The relation sense makes a significant difference in translation quality for Chinese but not for Arabic</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We compare the translation quality obtained on segments with reference translation containing no discourse connective, exactly one discourse connective and more than one discourse connective</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The test revealed that there is a significant difference in translation quality between 1-1 and 1-many segments for Chinese but not for Arabic</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We examine the quality of translations to English from Chinese and Arabic using Human-targeted Translation Edit Rates (HTER) [ 18 ] , which roughly captures the minimal number of edits necessary to transform the system output</a>
