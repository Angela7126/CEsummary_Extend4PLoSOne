VIn this section, we compare STRUCT to a state-of-the-art NLG system, CRISP, 1 1 We were unfortunately unable to get the PCRISP system to compile, and so we could not evaluate it and evaluate three hypotheses i) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as it generates increasingly large referring expressions, (ii) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as the size of the grammar which they use increases, and (iii) STRUCT is capable of communicating complex propositions, including multiple concurrent goals, negated goals, and nested subclauses

aVThis setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly deal with very specific communicative goals
