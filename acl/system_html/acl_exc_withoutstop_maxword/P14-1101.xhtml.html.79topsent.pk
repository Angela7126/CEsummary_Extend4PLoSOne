VTo demonstrate the benefit of situational information, we develop the Topic-Lexical-Distributional (TLD) model, which extends the LD model by assuming that words appear in situations analogous to documents in a topic model
p1
aVThis is the baseline IGMM model, which clusters vowel tokens using bottom-up distributional information only; the LD model adds top-down information by assigning categories in the lexicon, rather than on the token level
p2
aVIn this paper we explore the potential contribution of semantic information to phonetic learning by formalizing a model in which learners attend to the word-level context in which phones appear (as in the lexical-phonetic learning model of 11 ) and also to the situations in which word-forms are used
p3
aVWe therefore obtain the topic distributions used as input to the TLD model by training an LDA topic model ( 5 ) on a superset of the child-directed transcript data we use for lexical-phonetic learning, dividing the transcripts into small sections (the u'\u005cu2018' documents u'\u005cu2019' in LDA) that serve as our distinct situations u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc89'
p4
aVIn the HDP lexicon, a top-level global lexicon is generated as in the LD model
p5
aVThe TLD model retains the IGMM vowel phone component, but extends the lexicon of the LD model by adding topic-specific lexicons, which capture the notion that lexeme probabilities are topic-dependent
p6
aVHowever, due to a widespread assumption that infants do not know the meanings of many words at the age when they are learning phonetic categories (see 42 for a review), most recent models of early phonetic category acquisition have explored the phonetic learning problem in the absence of semantic information ( 8 ; 9 ; 11 ; 26 ; 50 )
p7
aVLexical information helps with phonetic categorization because it can disambiguate highly overlapping categories, such as the ae and eh categories in Figure 1
p8
aVConversely, potential minimal pairs that occur in situations with similar topic distributions are more likely to belong to the same topic and thus the same lexeme

aVWhen two word tokens contain the same
