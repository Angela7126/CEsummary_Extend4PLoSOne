<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u2062' S c</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling</a>
