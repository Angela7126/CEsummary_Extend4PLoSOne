<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Supervised learning</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This would involve initializing the weights prior to the semi-supervised procedure with the weights from the supervised learning model, so as to seed the semi-supervised approach with reasonable model, and use the partially annotated data to fine-tune the supervised model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We briefly discuss data-driven learning of weights for features that define the motif affinity scores and penalties</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We present a framework for extending distributional semantics to learn semantic representations of both words and phrases in terms of recurrent motifs, rather than arbitrary word tokens</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, the supervised learning model with subsequent annealing outperforms the supervised model in terms of both precision and recall; showing the utility of the semi-supervised method when seeded with a good initial model, and the additive value of partially labeled data</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Section 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmentation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this section, we describe the principal features used in the segmentation model</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For evaluating distributional representations for motifs (in terms of other motifs) learnt by the framework, we test these representations in two downstream tasks sentence polarity classification and metaphor detection</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We first quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the performance of the segmentation model, and then evaluate the distributional motif representations learnt by the model through two downstream applications</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For this task, the motif based distributional embeddings vastly outperform a conventional distributional model (DSM) based on token distributions, as well as additive (AVM) and multiplicative (MVM) models of</a>
