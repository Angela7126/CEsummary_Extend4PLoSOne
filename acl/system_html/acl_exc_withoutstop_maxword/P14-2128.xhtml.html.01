<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Row 4 and row 5 list accuracies of punctuations (all excluding words) on the development and test set, respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To see this, we evaluate the parsing accuracies of the selected parsers on words and punctuations, separately</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our first experiment is to investigate the effect of processing paired punctuations on parsing accuracy</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this section, we conduct a set of experiments to show the influence of punctuations on dependency parsing accuracies</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Results are listed in the fourth column of Table 4, which shows that parsing accuracies can be further improved by also processing non-paired punctuations</a>
