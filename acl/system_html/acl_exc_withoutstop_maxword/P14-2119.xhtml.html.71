<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision is not effective since hand-labeled data will be swamped by a larger amount of distantly labeled data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>[] , we generalize the labeled data through feature selection and model this additional information directly in the latent variable approaches</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In contrast to simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision as in the previous work by Zhang et al</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Instead we propose to perform feature selection to generalize human labeled data into training guidelines , and integrate them into latent variable model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we present the first effective approach,</a>
