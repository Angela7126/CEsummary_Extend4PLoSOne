<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, we have reduced SimRank u'\u2019' s cubic time complexity to a quadratic time complexity for CoSimRank or u'\u2013' assuming that the average degree d does not depend on n u'\u2013' SimRank u'\u2019' s quadratic time complexity to linear time complexity for the case of computing few similarities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step</a>
