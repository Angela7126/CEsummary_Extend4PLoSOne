<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To study the effect of different types of LK in WSD (Section 3.3 ), for each inventory sense, we choose synonyms ( syn ), hypernyms ( hpr ), and hyponyms ( hpo ) as extended LK in addition to its gloss</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Overall, all three sources of LK may complement each other in WSD tasks, with hyponyms particularly promising in both quantity and quality compared to hypernyms and synonyms</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Specifically, highly similar, fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both semantic and distributional), we postulate that their probability in the NBM is uniformly inflated among many sense candidates, and hence they decrease in distinguishability</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The WSD model is evaluated with gloss-only ( glo ), individual extended LK sources, and the combination of all four</a>
