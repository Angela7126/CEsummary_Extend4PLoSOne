<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Except for the phrase feature X 1 [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , our introduced input features X significantly improve the DAE feature learning (row 11 vs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Specially, Table 4 shows the detailed effectiveness of our introduced input features for DAE feature learning, and the results show that each type of features are very effective for DAE feature learning</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, the input original features for the DBN feature learning are too simple, the limited 4 phrase features of each phrase pair, such as bidirectional phrase translation probability and bidirectional lexical weighting [ Koehn et al.2003 ] , which are a bottleneck for learning effective feature representation</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence [ Hinton2002 ] , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation</a>
