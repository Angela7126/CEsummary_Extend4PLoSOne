VThe morphologically-generated candidates for a given source unlabeled phrase are initially defined as the target word sequences in the monolingual data that have the same stem sequence as one of the baseline u'\u005cu2019' s target translations for a source phrase which has the same stem sequence as the unlabeled source phrase
p1
aVIn our problem, the u'\u005cu201c' label u'\u005cu201d' for each node is actually a probability distribution over a set of translation candidates (target phrases
p2
aVwhere u'\u005cu210b' u'\u005cu2062' ( j ) is the translation candidate set for source phrase j , and T t ( e u'\u005cu2032' e ) is the propagation probability between nodes or phrases e and e u'\u005cu2032' on the target side
p3
aVWe then limit the set of translation options for each unlabeled source phrase (§ 2.3
