<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual edit</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Assuming that most edit-turn-pairs are non-corresponding, we expect a heavy imbalance in the class distribution</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As baseline, we defined a majority class classifier, which labels all edit-turn-pairs as non-corresponding</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some of the false positives (i.e., non-corresponding pairs classified as corresponding) were caused by pairs where the revision (as judged by its comment or the edit context) is related to the turn text, however the specific edit in this pair is not</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To assess the reliability of these annotations, one of the co-authors manually annotated a random subset of 100 edit-turn-pairs contained in ETP-gold as corresponding or non-corresponding</a>
