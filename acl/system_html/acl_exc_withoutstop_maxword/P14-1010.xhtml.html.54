<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Instead of producing an abstract feature layer, morphological segmentation transforms the target sentence by segmenting relevant morphemes, which are then handled as regular tokens during alignment and translation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Work on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Doing so enables the inclusion of an unsegmented target language model, and with a small amount of bookkeeping, it also allows the inclusion of features related to the operations performed during desegmentation (see Section 3.4</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>1) clitical u'\u2013' the two systems agree on a stem, but at least one clitic, often a prefix denoting a preposition or determiner, was dropped, added or replaced; (2) lexical u'\u2013' a word was changed to a morphologically unrelated word with a similar meaning; (3) inflectional u'\u2013' the words have the same stem, but different inflection due to a change in gender, number or verb tense; (4) part-of-speech u'\u2013' the two systems agree on the lemma, but have selected different parts of speech</a>
