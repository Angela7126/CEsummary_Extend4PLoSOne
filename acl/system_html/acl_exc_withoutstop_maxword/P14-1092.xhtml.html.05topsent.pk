VThe second baseline (CR + LS) trains a reranking model without discourse, using just the CR and LS features
p1
aVSo far, we have treated LS and discourse as distinct features in the reranking model, However, given that LS features greatly improve the CR baseline, we hypothesize that a natural extension to the discourse models would be to make use of LS similarity (in addition to the traditional information retrieval similarity) to label discourse segments
p2
aVSimilarly, line 9, the top-performing model that combines discourse with LS has a +5.69 absolute P@1 improvement over the CR + LS baseline
p3
aVFor the YA corpus, where lexical semantics showed the most benefit, simply adding LS features to the CR baseline increases baseline P@1 performance from 19.57 to 26.57, a +36% relative improvement
p4
aVFor the Bio corpus where answer candidates consist of entire paragraphs of a biology text, overall performance is dominated by inter-sentence discourse features
p5
aVFor Bio, we retrieved the top 20 answer candidates in CR
p6
aVLine 5, the top-performing model with discourse but without LS outperforms the CR baseline by +5.24 absolute P@1 improvement
