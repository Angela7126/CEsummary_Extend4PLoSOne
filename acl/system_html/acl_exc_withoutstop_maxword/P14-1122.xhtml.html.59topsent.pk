VQuality Enforcement Mechanisms Similar to Infection, TKT includes analogous mechanisms for limiting adversarial player annotations
p1
aVNon-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame
p2
aVThis bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations
p3
aVFor images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer
p4
aVFirst, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing
p5
aVBased on agreement with the gold standard (Table 1 , Col. 5), the estimated cost for crowdsourcing a correct true positive annotation increases to $0.014 for a concept-image and a $0.048 for concepts-concept annotation
p6
aVWhile their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return
