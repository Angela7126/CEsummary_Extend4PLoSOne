<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The second baseline, tries to decouple the Wsabie training from the embedding input, and trains a log linear model using the embeddings</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So the second baseline has the same input representation as Wsabie Embedding but uses a log-linear model instead of Wsabie</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We believe that the Wsabie Embedding model performs better than the Log-Linear Embedding baseline (that uses the same input representation) because the former setting allows examples with different labels and confusion sets to share information; this is due to the fact that all labels live in the same label space, and a single projection matrix is shared across the examples to map the input features to this space</a>
