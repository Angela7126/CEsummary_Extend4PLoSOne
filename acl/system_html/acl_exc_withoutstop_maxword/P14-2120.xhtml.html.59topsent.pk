VMore concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis
p1
aVThe Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p u'\u005cu2032' , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus
p2
aVThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p3
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p4
aVThis section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset
p5
aVFor example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u005cu201c' derailment of train u'\u005cu201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u005cu201c' crash of train u'\u005cu201d'
p6
aVAnother case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI
p7
aVOn the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems
p8
aVThus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text
p9
aVSecond, each NI should be classified as Definite NI (DNI) , meaning that the role filler must exist in the discourse, or Indefinite NI otherwise
