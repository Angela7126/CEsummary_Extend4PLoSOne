<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As an instance of discriminative models, we describe an FFNN-based word alignment model [ 40 ] , which is our baseline</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For the FFNN-based model, we set the word embedding length M to 30, the number of units of a hidden layer z 1 to 100, and the window size of contexts to 5</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the lookup layer, each of these words is converted to its word embedding, and then the concatenation of the two embeddings ( x j ) is fed to the hidden layer in the same manner as the FFNN-based model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that the development data was not used in the alignment tasks, i.e.,, B u'\u2062' T u'\u2062' E u'\u2062' C and H u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' s u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' d u'\u2062' s , because the hyperparameters of the alignment models were set by preliminary small-scale experiments</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that alignments in the FFNN-based model are also governed by first-order Markov dynamics because an alignment score depends on the previous alignment a j - 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Table 4 demonstrates that the proposed RNN-based model outperforms I u'\u2062' B u'\u2062' M u'\u2062' 4 trained from the unlabeled 40 K data by employing either the 1</a>
