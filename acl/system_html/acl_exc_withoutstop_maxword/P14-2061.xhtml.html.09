<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given samples of sign language videos (unknown sign language with one signer per video), our system performs the following steps to learn a feature representation (note that these video samples are separate from the video samples that are later used for classifier learning or testing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For the unsupervised feature learning, two types of patches are created</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We fix the size of the patches such that they all have r rows, c columns and f frames and we extract patches m times</a>
