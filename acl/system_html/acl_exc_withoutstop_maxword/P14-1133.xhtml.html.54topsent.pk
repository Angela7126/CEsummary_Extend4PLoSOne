VWe use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them
p1
aVOnce the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model
p2
aVFor example, the association model identifies that the paraphrase for u'\u005cu201c' What type of music did Richard Wagner Play u'\u005cu201d' is u'\u005cu201c' What is the musical genres of Richard Wagner u'\u005cu201d' , by relating phrases such as u'\u005cu201c' type of music u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' musical genres u'\u005cu201d'
