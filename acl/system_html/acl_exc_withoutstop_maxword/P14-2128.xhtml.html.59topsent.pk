VMoreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations
p1
aVNote that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account
p2
aVOur method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations
p3
aVThe result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing
p4
aVThe fact that parsers achieve low accuracies on punctuations is to some degree expected, because the head of a punctuation mark is linguistically less well-defined
p5
aVSince long sentences are inherently more difficult to parse, to make a fair comparison, we further divide the development set according to sentence lengths as shown in the first row
