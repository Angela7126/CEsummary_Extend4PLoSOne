<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The difference between the sentence subtree and the rooted sentence subtree methods was fairly small</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We denote by r i u'\u2062' j the variable that is one if word i u'\u2062' j is selected as a root of an extracting sentence subtree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Subtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser u'\u2019' s root</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Constraints ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are tree constraints for a document tree and sentence trees r i u'\u2062' j in Constraint ( 3 ) allows the system to extract non-rooted sentence subtrees, as we previously mentioned</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Rooted sentence subtree only selects rooted sentence subtrees 2 2 We achieved this by making R c u'\u2062' ( i ) only return the parser u'\u2019' s root node in Figure 7</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We compared our method ( sentence subtree ) with that of EDU selection [ 11 ]</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Extractive summarization is one well-known approach to text summarization and extractive methods represent a document (or a set of documents) as a set of some textual units</a>
