<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since the annotators are forced to label all required edges, the decision to label an edge as vague instead of a defined temporal relation is critical</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>With this new process, we created a dense ordering of document events that can properly evaluate both relation identification and relation annotation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The annotator did not look at the pair of events, so a relation may or may not exist</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The annotator looked at the pair of events and decided that no temporal relation exists</a>
