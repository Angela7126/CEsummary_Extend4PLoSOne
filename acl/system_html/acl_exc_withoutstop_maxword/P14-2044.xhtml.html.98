<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This means that the membership of a word in a cluster requires only morphological similarity to some other element in the cluster, not to the cluster centroid; which may be more appropriate for languages with multiple morphological paradigms</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Moreover, the mapping between a surface form and morphology is complex and nonlinear, so that simple metrics such as edit distance will only weakly approximate morphological similarity</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>V-m can be somewhat sensitive to the number of clusters [ 19 ] but much less so than m-1 [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In contrast, we use pairwise morphological similarity as a prior in a non-parametric clustering model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Recent work also shows that the combination of morphological and distributional information yields the best results, especially cross-linguistically [ 9 , 3 ]</a>
