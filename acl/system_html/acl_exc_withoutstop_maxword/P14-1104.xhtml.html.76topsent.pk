VWe employ Amazon u'\u005cu2019' s Mechanical Turk (AMT) to label the emotions of Twitter data, and apply the proposed methods to the AMT dataset with the goals of improving the annotation quality at low cost, as well as learning accurate emotion classifiers
p1
aVSpecifically, according to Formula ( 3 ), a high (absolute value of) spread score indicates that the Delta IDF score of that term on that class is high and deviates greatly from the scores on other classes
p2
aV1) accurately predicting the labels of data points and ranking them based on prediction confidence, so that the most likely errors can be effectively identified; (2) requiring less time on training, so that the saved time can be spent on correcting more labeling errors
p3
aVDelta IDF boosts the importance of terms that tend to be class-specific in the dataset, since they are usually effective features in distinguishing one class from another
p4
aVFollowing this idea, we develop computationally cheap feature weighting techniques to counteract such effect by boosting
