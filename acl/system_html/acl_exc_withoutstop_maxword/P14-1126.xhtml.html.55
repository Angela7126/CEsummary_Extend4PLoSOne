<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Another advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Obviously, bilingual treebanks are much more difficult to acquire than the resources required in our scenario, since the labeled training data and the parallel text in our case are completely separated</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work, we propose a learning framework for transferring dependency grammars</a>
