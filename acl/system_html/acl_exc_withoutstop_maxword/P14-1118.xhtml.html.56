<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the next sections, we define a baseline feature vector model and a novel structural model based on kernel methods</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Next, we show the learning curves to analyze the behavior of FVEC and STRUCT models according to the training size</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The learning curves depict the behavior of FVEC and STRUCT models as we increase the size of the training set</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We go beyond traditional feature vectors by employing structural models ( STRUCT ), which encode each comment into a shallow syntactic tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When using AUTO as a source domain, STRUCT model provides additional 1-3% of absolute improvement, except for the sentiment task</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For each of the lexicons, we use the number of words found in the comment that have positive and negative sentiment as a feature</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Intuitively, the STRUCT model relies on more general syntactic patterns and may overcome the sparseness problems incurred by the FVEC model when little training data is available</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One of the challenging aspects of sentiment analysis of YouTube data is that the comments may express the sentiment not only towards</a>
