<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, the lexical heads of punctuations are not as well defined as those of words</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our method is able to capture that the root, w h , of the sub-tree within the paired-punctuation, such as u'\u201c' Mechanisms u'\u201d' in Figure 1, generally serves as a modifier of the words outside, while the</a>
