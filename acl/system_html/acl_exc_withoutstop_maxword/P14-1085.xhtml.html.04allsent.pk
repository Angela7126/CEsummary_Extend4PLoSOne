(lp0
VA hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary
p1
aVAfter the sentences are clustered, we have a structure for the hierarchical summary that dictates the number of summaries and the number of sentences in each summary
p2
aVNotice the contribution from a sentence depends on individual salience, coherence ( C u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' h ) based on sentences visible on the user path down the hierarchy to this sentence, and coherence ( P u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' h ) based on its parent sentence and its child summary
p3
aVMoreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary
p4
aVThe top of the hierarchy is a summary X 1 representing all of D , and each summary X i consists of summary units x i , j ( e.g., the j th sentence of summary i ) that point to a child summary, except at the leaf nodes of the hierarchy
p5
aVUsers navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused
p6
aVOverall, our algorithm is a two level nested search algorithm u'\u005cu2013' beam search in the outer loop to search through the space of partial summaries and local search (hill climbing with random restarts) in the inner loop to pick the best sentence to add to the existing partial summary
p7
aVA user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary
p8
aVThe problem of hierarchical summarization as described in Section 2 has all of the requirements of MDS, and additional complexities of inducing a hierarchical structure, processing an order of magnitude bigger input, generating a much larger output, and enforcing coherence between parent and child summaries
p9
aVSince most of the sentence contributions depend on the path from the root to the sentence, we build our partial summary by incrementally adding a sentence top-down in the hierarchy and from first sentence to last within a cluster summary
p10
aVWe then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4
p11
aVOther research identifies the hierarchical structure of the documents and generates a summary that prioritizes more general information according to the structure [ 22 , 5 ] , or gains coverage by drawing sentences from different parts of the hierarchy [ 34 , 31 ]
p12
aVWe compared Summa against two baseline systems which represent the main NLP methods for large-scale summarization an algorithm for creating timelines over sentences [ 7 ] , 3 3 Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain more recent timeline systems from authors of the systems and a state-of-the-art flat MDS system [ 19 ]
p13
aVLastly, we require that sentences are drawn from the cluster that they represent and that the number of sentences in the summary corresponding to each non-leaf cluster c is equivalent to the number of child clusters of c
p14
aVWe estimate parent to child coherence as the coherence between a parent sentence and each sentence in its child summary as
p15
aVFor example, the reaction sentence, u'\u005cu201c' President Clinton vowed to track down the perpetrators behind the bombs that exploded outside the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Friday, u'\u005cu201d' would have a higher score than the action sentence, u'\u005cu201c' Bombs exploded outside the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Friday u'\u005cu201d' This problem occurs because the first sentence has a higher ROUGE score (it covers more important words than the second sentence
p16
aVFurthermore, the summary should not contain redundant information and each cluster summary should honor the given budget, i.e.,, maximum summary length b
p17
aVInput to a hierarchical summarization system is a set of related documents D and a budget b for each summary within the hierarchy (in bytes, words, or sentences
p18
aVThe parent sentence occasionally expressed a less important fact that the child summary did not then expand on or, more commonly, the child summary was not focused enough
p19
aVFor example, suppose the parent sentence is, u'\u005cu201c' A Swissair plane Wednesday night crashed off Nova Scotia, Canada u'\u005cu201d' A very good child sentence is, u'\u005cu201c' The airline confirmed that all passengers died u'\u005cu201d' However, based on their surface features, the sentence, u'\u005cu201c' A plane made an unscheduled landing after a Swissair plane crashed off the coast of Canada, u'\u005cu201d' appears to be a better choice
p20
aVIntuitively, each cluster summary in the hierarchical summary should convey the most salient information in that cluster
p21
aVWe present Summa , the first hierarchical summarization system, which operates on news corpora and summarizes over an order of magnitude more documents than traditional MDS systems, producing summaries an order of magnitude larger
p22
aVMDS systems do not scale to data sets ten times larger and proportionately longer summaries they either cannot run on large input or produce a disorganized summary that is difficult to understand
p23
aVWe found that for the top level of the summary, the parent sentence generally represented the most important event in the cluster and the child summary usually expressed details or reactions of the event
p24
aVBecause reading 300 articles per topic is impractical, we asked AMT workers to read a Wikipedia article on the same topic and then identify the three most important events and the five most important secondary events
p25
aVWe require two types of coherence coherence between the parent and child summaries and coherence within each summary X i
p26
aVUsers preferred the hierarchical summaries three times more often than timelines and over ten times more often than flat summaries
p27
aVEach non-leaf summary is associated with a set of child summaries where each gives details of an element (e.g., sentence) in the parent summary
p28
aVThe parent sentence must have positive evidence of coherence with the sentences in its child summary
p29
aVWe present a novel MDS paradigm, hierarchical summarization , which operates on large document collections, creating summaries that organize the information coherently
p30
aVOne of the authors graded how much each non-leaf sentence in a summary was coherent with its child summary on a scale of one to five, with one being incoherent and five being perfectly coherent
p31
aVIn this experiment, we assess the salience of the information captured by the different systems, and the ability of Summa to organize the information so that more important information is placed at higher levels
p32
aVA child summary adds more detail to the information in its parent summary unit
p33
aVHowever, when the number of clusters is too large for the given summary budget, the sentences will have to be too short, and when the number of clusters is too small, we will not use enough of the budget
p34
aVIn hierarchical summarization, however, a cluster summary may span hundreds of documents and a wide range of information
p35
aVWe present a user study which demonstrates the value of hierarchical summarization over timelines and flat multi-document summaries in learning about a complex topic
p36
aVUsers overwhelmingly preferred hierarchical summaries to flat summaries (92%) and learned just as much
p37
aVWe set the maximum number of clusters k m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' x and minimum number of clusters k m u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n to be a function of the budget b and the average sentence length in the cluster s a u'\u005cu2062' v u'\u005cu2062' g , such that k m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' x u'\u005cu22c5' s a u'\u005cu2062' v u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2264' b and k m u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu22c5' s a u'\u005cu2062' v u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2265' b / 2
p38
aVOne of the authors then manually identified the presence of these events in the hierarchical summaries, the timelines and the flat MDS summaries
p39
aVA hierarchical summary H of a document collection D is a set of summaries X organized into a hierarchy
p40
aVSince Summa was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1 , it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those from Summa
p41
aVHaving estimated salience, redundancy, and two forms of coherence, we can now put this information together into a single objective function that measures the quality of a candidate hierarchical summary
p42
aVThe event recall shows the percentage of events mentioned at that level or above in the hierarchical summary
p43
aVSome focused on creating a hierarchical summary of a single document [ 3 , 21 ] , relying on the structure inherent in single documents
p44
aVb u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) is the difference in the number of sentences published the day before the first date in c and the average number of sentences published on the first and second date of c
p45
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering
p46
aVIn latter cases, the hierarchical summaries provided little advantage over the timelines because it was more difficult to arrange the sentences hierarchically
p47
aVWe conducted an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) evaluation where AMT workers compared the output of Summa to that of timelines and flat summaries
p48
aVSumma hierarchically clusters the sentences by time, and then summarizes the clusters using an objective function that optimizes salience and coherence
p49
aVWhile the facts of the sentences made sense together, the summaries sometimes did not read as if they were written by a human, but as a series of disparate sentences
p50
aVFurthermore, the hierarchical summary should not include redundant sentences
p51
aVThe features include shared noun counts, sentence length, TF*IDF cosine similarity, timestamp difference, and features drawn from information extraction such as number of shared tuples in Open IE [ 20 ]
p52
aVSince computing the best child summary is also intractable we approximate a solution by a local search algorithm over the child cluster
p53
aVThus, a hierarchical summary must also have intra-cluster coherence and parent-to-child coherence
p54
aVWhile the flat summaries were disjointed, they were good at including salient information, with the most salient tending to be near the start of the summary
p55
aVOur experiments are designed to evaluate how effective hierarchical summarization is in summarizing a large, complex topic and how well this helps users learn about the topic
p56
aVEach summary should maximize coverage of salient information; it should minimize redundancy ; and it should have intra-cluster coherence as well as parent-to-child coherence
p57
aVIn preliminary experiments, we noticed that many sentences that were reaction sentences were given a higher salience than action sentences
p58
aVBecause we are interested in temporal hierarchical summarization, we hierarchically cluster all the sentences in the input documents by time
p59
aVWhen we examined the reasons given by the users, we found that the people who preferred the hierarchical summaries liked that they gave a big picture overview and were then allowed to drill down deeper
p60
aVSecond, each user directs his or her own experience, so a user interested in one aspect need only explore that section of the data without having to view or understand the entire summary
p61
aVIdeally, the maximum depth of the clustering would be a function of the number of sentences in each cluster, but in our implementation, we set the maximum depth to three, which works well for the size of the datasets we use (300 articles
p62
aVWe use SUTime [ 6 ] to normalize temporal references, and we parse the sentences with the Stanford parser [ 13 ] and use a set of simple heuristics to determine if the timestamps in the sentence refer to the root verb
p63
aVOptimizing this objective function is NP-hard, so we approximate a solution by using beam search over the space of partial hierarchical summaries
p64
aVA hierarchical clustering is a tree in which if a cluster g p is the parent of cluster g c , then each sentence in g c is also in g p
p65
aVWe identify redundant sentences using a linear regression classifier trained on a manually labeled subset of the DUC u'\u005cu2019' 03 sentences
p66
aVFor quality control, we asked workers to complete a qualification task first, in which they were required to write a short summary of a news article
p67
aVBelow we describe related work on traditional MDS, structured summaries, timelines, discovering threads of documents and the uses of hierarchies in generating summaries
p68
aVThere are two primary shortcomings to these approaches first, they require the user to sort through large amounts of potentially overwhelming information, and second, the output is static u'\u005cu2013' users with different interests will see the same information
p69
aVFirst, summarizing sentences are rare, making good choices for parent sentences difficult to find
p70
aVWe also evaluated at what level in the hierarchy the events were identified for the hierarchical summaries
p71
aVUsing the same setup as in the previous experiment, for each topic, five AMT workers spent three minutes reading through a timeline or summary and were then asked to write a description of what they had learned
p72
aVAre hierarchical summaries more effective than other methods for learning about complex events
p73
aVTraditionally, MDS systems have focused on three to six sentence summaries covering 10-15 documents
p74
aVThese are coreference mentions or discourse cues where none of the sentences read before (either in an ancestor summary or in the current summary) contain an antecedent
p75
aVWe looked more closely at those cases where the participants either preferred the timelines or were indifferent and found that this preference was most common when the topic was not dominated by a few major events, but was instead a series of similarly important events
p76
aVFor this reason, we may consider a summary acceptable even if it has limited positive evidence of coherence in the ADG, as long as there is no negative evidence in the form of negative edges
p77
aVPrevious work has used AMT workers for summary evaluations and has shown high correlations with expert ratings [ 8 ]
p78
aVFor example, the following is a reasonable summary for events spanning two weeks s 1 Bombs exploded at two US embassies s 2 US missiles struck in Afghanistan and Sudan
p79
aVWe measure salience of a summary ( S u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( X ) ) as the sum of the saliences of individual sentences ( u'\u005cu2211' i S u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( x i )
p80
aVDo users prefer hierarchical summaries for topic exploration
p81
aVTo account for P u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' h , we estimate the contribution of the sentence by jointly identifying its best child summary
p82
aVThe child summary may include sub-events or background and reactions to the event or topic in the parent
p83
aV[ 26 ] extended work on coherent threads to finding coherent maps of documents, where a map is set of intersecting threads representing how the threads interact and relate
p84
aVThe explosion in the number of documents on the Web necessitates automated approaches that organize and summarize large document collections on a complex topic
p85
aVIn this paper, we describe Summa , the first hierarchical summarization system for multi-document summarization
p86
aVWe also have the set of sentences from which each summary is drawn
p87
aVEvaluating how much a user learned is inherently difficult, more so when the goal is to allow the user the freedom to explore information based on individual interest
p88
aVFor this reason, instead of asking a set of predefined questions, we assess the knowledge gain by following the methodology of [ 26 ] u'\u005cu2013' asking users to write a paragraph summarizing the information learned
p89
aVWhile recognizing primary events is relatively simple because they are repeated frequently, identification of important secondary events often requires external knowledge
p90
aVHowever, we do not fix the child summary at this time u'\u005cu2013' we simply use it to estimate P u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' h when using that sentence
p91
aVWe define several metrics in Section 4 for a well-constructed hierarchical summary
p92
aVFor example, Figure 3 shows the number of articles per day related to the 1998 embassy bombings published in the New York Times (identified using a key word search
p93
aVThus, descriptions from both Summa and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information
p94
aVThe output is the hierarchical summary H , which we define formally as follows
p95
aVIn this way, the system can present large amounts of information without overwhelming the user, and the user can tailor the output to their interests
p96
aVWe aggregated responses from ten workers per topic and chose the three most common primary and five most common secondary events
p97
aVWe perform hierarchical clustering top-down, at each point solving for Equation 1 u'\u005cu0391' was set using a grid-search over a development set
p98
aVAt each level, we cluster the sentences by the method described above and choose the number of clusters k according to the gap statistic [ 30 ]
p99
aVThis score will essentially serve as a rough measure of coverage of the entire summary to the Wikipedia article
p100
aVFirst, the information presented at the start is small and grows only as the user directs it, so as not to overwhelm the user
p101
aVWe performed an additional manual evaluation that assesses the recall of important events for each system
p102
aVExisting methods for multi-document summarization (MDS) are designed to produce short summaries of 10-15 documents
p103
aVI am used to these timelines and they feel comfortable u'\u005cu201d' Users complained that the flat summaries were disjointed, confusing, and very frustrating to read
p104
aVTypical responses included, u'\u005cu201c' Could gather and absorb the information at my own pace, u'\u005cu201d' and, u'\u005cu201c' Easier to follow and understand u'\u005cu201d' When users preferred the timelines, they usually remarked that it was more familiar, i.e., u'\u005cu201c' I liked the familiarity of the format
p105
aVThe summary is hierarchically organized along one or more organizational principles such as time, location, entities, or events
p106
aVHierarchical summarization has two important strengths in the context of large-scale summarization
p107
aVWe simplify the problem by decomposing it into two steps hierarchical clustering and summarizing over the clustering (see Figure 2 for an example
p108
aVWe chose topics containing a set of related events that unfolded over several months and were prominent enough to be reported in at least 300 articles
p109
aVWe then asked other AMT workers to read and compare the descriptions written by the first set of workers
p110
aVIt mimics how someone with a general interest in a complex topic would learn about it from an expert u'\u005cu2013' first, the expert would provide an overview, and then more specific information about various aspects
p111
aVThis method finds those sentences more salient that mention nouns or verbs that occur frequently in the cluster
p112
aVTraditional approaches to large-scale summarization have included flat summaries and timelines
p113
aVHow coherent is the hierarchical structure in the summaries
p114
aVThis organizes the information into manageable, semantically-related sections and induces a hierarchical structure over the input
p115
aVHow informative are the hierarchical summaries compared to the other methods
p116
aVThis research was supported in part by ARO contract W911NF-13-1-0246, DARPA Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) contract FA8750-13-2-0019, UW-IITD subcontract RP02815, and the Yahoo
p117
aVAn edge from sentence s i to s j with positive weight indicates that s j may follow s i in a coherent summary, e.g., continued mention of an event or entity, or coreference link between s i and s j
p118
aVWe design a recursive clustering algorithm that automatically chooses the appropriate number of clusters at each split
p119
aVWorkers were not allowed to see the timeline or summary while writing
p120
aVFor example, in the kidnapping and beheading of Daniel Pearl there were two or three obviously major events, whereas in the Kargil War there were many smaller important events
p121
aVWhile ROUGE serves as a rough measure of coverage, we were interested in gathering more fine-grained information on the informativeness of each system
p122
aVSalience is the value of each sentence to the topic from which the documents are drawn
p123
aVShahaf and Guestrin [ 27 ] formalized the characteristics of a good chain of articles and proposed an algorithm to connect two specified articles
p124
aVFor example, given the topic, u'\u005cu201c' 1998 embassy bombings, u'\u005cu201d' the first summary (Figure 1 ) might mention that the US retaliated by striking Afghanistan and Sudan
p125
aVFollowing previous research in MDS, we computed individual saliences using a linear regression classifier trained on ROUGE scores over the DUC u'\u005cu2019' 03 dataset [ 18 , 8 ]
p126
aVA related track of research investigates discovering threads of documents
p127
aVwhere x c p is the parent sentence for cluster c and w G + u'\u005cu2062' ( x c p , x c , i ) is the sum of the positive edge weights from x c p to x c , i in the ADG G
p128
aVThis research operates on the document level, while ours operates on the sentence level
p129
aVLin and Bilmes [ 19 ] proposed a state-of-the-art system that uses submodularity in sentence selection to accomplish these goals
p130
aV[ 32 ] used inter-date and intra-date sentence dependencies, and Chieu and Lee [ 7 ] used sentence similarity
p131
aVwhere d is a date indexed over time, such that d j is a day before d j + 1 , and d i is the first date in c p u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' ( d i ) is the number of sentences published on d i
p132
aVAfter acquiring the timestamps, we must hierarchically cluster the sentences into sets that make sense to summarize together
p133
aVNote that there is no good translation of ROUGE for hierarchical summarization
p134
aVThis paper is also supported in part by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) via AFRL contract number FA8650-10-C-7058
p135
aVWe paired up workers such that one worker would see output from Summa for the first topic and a competing system for the second and the other worker would see the reverse
p136
aV5 5 We excluded one topic (the handover of the Lockerbie bombing suspects) because the corresponding Wikipedia article had insufficient information
p137
aVIn general, the flat summaries were quite redundant, which contributed to the slightly lower event recall
p138
aVWe propose a new task for large-scale summarization called hierarchical summarization
p139
aVSome research has explored generating structured summaries
p140
aVWe first identified which events were most important in a news story
p141
aV81% of the primary events are present in the first or second level, and 76% of the secondary events are mentioned by the third level
p142
aVMost extractive summarization research aims to maximize coverage while reducing redundancy (e.g., [ 4 , 24 , 23 ]
p143
aVAspects are identified either by a training corpus of articles in the same domain [ 25 ] , by an entity-aspect LDA model [ 17 ] , or by Wikipedia templates of related topics [ 35 ]
p144
aVThe hierarchical clustering serves as input to the second step u'\u005cu2013' summarizing given the hierarchy
p145
aVAdditionally, long timelines can be overwhelming, short timelines have low information content, and there is no method for personalized exploration
p146
aVDescriptions written by workers using Summa were preferred over twice as often as those from timelines
p147
aVIn traditional MDS, the documents are usually quite focused, allowing for highly focused summaries
p148
aVThe second problem relates to the difficulty in identifying whether two sentences are on the same topic
p149
aVWe treat redundancy and budget as hard constraints and coherence and salience as soft constraints
p150
aVWe discuss our experiments in Section 5 , related work in Section 6 , and conclusions in Section 7
p151
aVEach node in the hierarchy has an associated flat summary, which summarizes the sentences in that cluster
p152
aVGiven a maximum and minimum number of clusters, we must determine the appropriate number of clusters
p153
aVWe thank Amitabha Bagchi, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Danish Contractor, Oren Etzioni, Tony Fader, Carlos Guestrin, Prachi Jain, Lucy Vanderwende, Luke Zettlemoyer, and the anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and feedback
p154
aV1 1 In the DUC evaluations, summaries have a budget of 665 bytes and cover 10 documents
p155
aVThe difference in recall between Summa and Timeline was significant in both cases, and the difference between Summa and Flat-MDS was not
p156
aVWe next tested the hierarchical coherence
p157
aVSumma output was judged superior more than three times as often as timelines, and users learned more in twice as many cases
p158
aVWe introduce and formalize the novel task of hierarchical summarization
p159
aVThus, we simply use the traditional ROUGE metric, which will not capture any of the hierarchical format
p160
aVThe user can click on this information to learn more about these attacks
p161
aVThe lower coherence scores were often the result of too few lexical connections or lack of a theme or story
p162
aVHierarchical summarization has the following novel characteristics
p163
aVOur measure of intra-cluster coherence minimizes the number of missing references
p164
aVIn the next section, we formalize hierarchical summarization
p165
aVWe rely on the approximate discourse graph (ADG) that was proposed in [ 8 ] as the basis for measuring coherence
p166
aVOthers have emphasized identifying important dates, primarily by bursts of news [ 28 , 1 , 11 , 12 ]
p167
aVEven though there is scope for improvement, we find these coherence scores encouraging for a first algorithm for the task
p168
aVIn this first implementation, we have opted for temporal organization, since this is generally the most appropriate for news events
p169
aVIn future work we intend to design a system that dynamically selects the best organizing principle for each level of the hierarchy
p170
aVThere were two main events u'\u005cu2013' on the 7th, the embassies were bombed and on the 20th, the US retaliated through missile strikes
p171
aVTo adjust for this problem, we use only words identified in the main clause (heuristically identified via the parse tree) to compute our salience scores
p172
aVThe figure shows a correspondence between these events and news spikes
p173
aVThe tradeoff parameters u'\u005cu0392' and u'\u005cu0393' were set based on a development set
p174
aVThe workers were asked which user appeared to have learned more and why
p175
aVIntuitively, the objective function should balance salience and coherence

aVA system may select different organization for different portions of the hierarchy, for example, organizing first by location or prominent entity and then by date for the next level
p188
aVWhile we aim to summarize collections of information, this track seeks to identify relationships between documents
p189
aVOthers investigated creating hierarchies of words or phrases to organize documents [ 15 , 16 , 29 , 10 ]
p190
aVThe number of clusters at each split should be what is most natural for the input data
p191
aV[ 9 ] proposed a probabilistic technique for extracting a diverse set of threads from a given collection
p192
aVWe cannot know a priori the number of clusters for a given topic
p193
aVSome also explained that it was easier to remember information when presented with the overview first
p194
aVFrom this evaluation, one can gather that the systems have similar coverage of the Wikipedia articles

aVThese approaches attempt to identify major aspects of a topic, but do not compile content to describe those aspects

aVWe asked the workers to choose which format they preferred and to explain why
p201
aVWe first automatically assessed informativeness by calculating the ROUGE-1 scores of the output of each of the systems
p202
aVWe drew our articles from the Gigaword corpus, which contains articles from the New York Times and other major newspapers
p203
aVFor the gold standard comparison summary, we use the Wikipedia articles for the topics
p204
aVwhere W k is the score for the clusters computed with Equation 1 , and E n u'\u005cu2217' is the expectation under a sample of size n from a reference distribution
p205
aVSpecifically, for each level, the algorithm will cluster repeatedly with k varying from the minimum to the maximum

p210
aVNews tends to be bursty u'\u005cu2013' many articles on a topic appear at once and then taper out [ 14 ]
p211
aVBefore clustering, we timestamp all sentences
p212
aVFor each topic, we used the 300 documents that best matched a key word search
p213
aVWe selected topics which were between five and fifteen years old so that evaluators would have relatively less pre-existing knowledge about the topic
p214
aVA negative edge indicates an unfulfilled discourse cue or co-reference mention
p215
aVThere are several possible organizing principles for the hierarchy u'\u005cu2013' by date, by entities, by locations, or by events
p216
aVwhere s u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' z u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) is the number of dates in cluster c
p217
aVThese methods assume a common structure for all topics in a category, and do not allow for more than two levels in the structure
p218
aVA few papers have examined the relationship between summarization and hierarchies
p219
aVThe algorithm will return the k that maximizes the gap statistic
p220
aVEach node in the ADG is a sentence from the dataset
p221
aVFive workers were hired to view each topic-system pair

aVFaculty Research and Engagement Award
p223
aVSome organizing principles will fit the data in a document collection better than others
p224
aVUnfortunately, neither agglomerative nor divisive clustering is suitable, since both assume a binary split at each node [ 2 ]
p225
aVWe used the coherence scale from DUC u'\u005cu2019' 04
p226
aVThe timelines, on the other hand, were both incoherent and at the same time reported less important facts
p227
aVFor each pair of descriptions, four workers evaluated the pair
p228
aVHaving defined the task, we now describe the methodology behind our implementation, Summa
p229
aVIdeal splits for this example would occur just before each spike in coverage
p230
aVThis result stems from two problems in our algorithm
p231
aVwhere C is a clustering, B u'\u005cu2062' ( C ) is the burstiness of the set of clusters, E u'\u005cu2062' ( C ) is the evenness of the clusters, and u'\u005cu0391' is the tradeoff parameter
p232
aVStandard checks such as approval rating, location filtering, etc were used for removing spam
p233
aVThe descriptions were randomly ordered to remove bias
