<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Accuracy is defined as the number of correct responses over the number of instances</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The result is a u'\u201c' softer u'\u201d' proxy of association than the binary view of overlaps in existing Lesk variants</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string</a>
