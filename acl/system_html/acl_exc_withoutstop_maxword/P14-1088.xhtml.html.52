<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Star-Sem Data is a portion of the dataset released for the *SEM 2012 shared task [] , parsed using the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG, [] ) and the resulting parse forest disambiguated based on discriminants</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A distinguishing feature of the tectogrammatical analyses, vis a vis the other treebanks we are using, is that semantically empty words only take part in the analytical annotation layer and nodes are inserted at the tectogrammatical layer to represent covert elements of the sentence not present in the surface syntax of the analytical layer</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Instead, the grammar parses the input sentences, and the annotator selects the correct parse (or rejects all the candidates) based on discriminants 2 2 A discriminant is an attribute of the analyses produced by the grammar where some of the analyses differ, e.g., is the word jump a noun or a verb, or does a PP attach to a VP or the VP u'\u2019' s object NP of the parse forest</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore we remove the leaf nodes in the case of phrase structure trees, and in the case of dependency trees we compare trees whose edges are unlabelled and nodes are labelled with the dependency relation between that word and its head; the root node receives the label u'\u0395'</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As shown in \citeN Art:Poe08, such measures are biased in favour of annotation schemes with fewer categories and do not account for skewed distributions between classes, which can give high observed agreement, even if the annotations are inconsistent</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The large number of sentences excluded in the PCEDT is due to the fact that in the tectogrammatical analysis of the PCEDT, inserting and deleting nodes is an important part of the annotation task</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Tree edit distance has previously been used in the TedEval software [] for parser evaluation agnostic to both annotation scheme and theoretical framework, but this by itself is still an uncorrected accuracy measure and thus unsuitable for our purposes</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The reason the PCEDT gets such low LAS is essentially the same as the reason many sentences had to be excluded from the computation in the first place; since inserting and deleting</a>
