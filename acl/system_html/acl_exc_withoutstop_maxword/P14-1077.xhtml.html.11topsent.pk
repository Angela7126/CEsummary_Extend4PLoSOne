VMost existing knowledge bases represent their knowledge facts in the form of ( subject, relation, object ) triple, which can be seen as relational facts between entity tuples
p1
aVSpecifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions
p2
aVIn this paper, we will address how to derive and exploit two categories of these clues the expected types and the cardinality requirements of a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, in the scenario of relation extraction
p3
aVIn contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues
p4
aVThe previous categories of disagreements are all based on the implicit type information of the relations u'\u005cu2019' arguments, Now we make use of the clues of argument cardinality requirements
