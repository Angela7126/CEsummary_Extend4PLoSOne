<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Under the output layer, the network consists of two modules the web-feature module , which incorporates knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM, and the sparse-feature module , which makes use of other POS tagging features</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We can choose to use only the word representations of the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While those approaches mainly explore token-level representations (word or character embeddings), using WRRBM is able to utilize both word and n-gram representations</a>
