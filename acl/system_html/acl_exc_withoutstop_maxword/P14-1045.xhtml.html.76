<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They can be divided in three groups, according to their origin they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of [] as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method MetaCost of [] as a cost-aware learning method</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>First, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u2019' s score; r u'\u2062'</a>
