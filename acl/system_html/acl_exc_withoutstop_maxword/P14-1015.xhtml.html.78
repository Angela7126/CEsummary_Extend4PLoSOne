<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In short, each solution word is assumed to be generated from the language model or the translation model (conditioned on the problem words) with a probability of u'\u039b' and 1 - u'\u039b' respectively, thus accounting for the correlation assumption</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>[ 3 ] reports a study that illustrates that non-solution posts are, on an average, as similar to the problem as solution posts in technical forums</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification</a>
