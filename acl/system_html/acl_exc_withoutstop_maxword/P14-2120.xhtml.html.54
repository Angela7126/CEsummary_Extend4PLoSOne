<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u201c' derailment of train u'\u201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u201c' crash of train u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We ran three configurations for the second feature, where in the first only syntactically expressed relationships are used, in the second all the implied relationships, as detected by a human annotator, are added, and in the third only the implied relationships detected by our algorithm are added</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p u'\u2032' , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems</a>
