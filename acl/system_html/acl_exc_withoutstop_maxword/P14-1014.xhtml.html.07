<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We trained 3 WRRBMs using the email domain data (RBM-E), weblog domain data (RBM-W) and mixed domain data (RBM-M), respectively,</a>
