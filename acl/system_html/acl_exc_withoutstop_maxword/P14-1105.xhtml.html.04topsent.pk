VWith this new dataset we show that rnn s not only label sentences well but also improve further when given additional phrase-level annotations rnn s are quantitatively more effective than existing methods that use syntactic and semantic features separately, and we also illustrate how our model correctly identifies ideological bias in complex syntactic constructions
