<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Algorithms for string alignment were successfully used for identifying cognates based on both their forms, orthographic and phonetic</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, to align pairs of words we employ the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [ 29 ] , which is mainly used for aligning sequences of proteins or nucleotides</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, we use SpSim [ 11 ] , which outperformed the longest common subsequence ratio and a similarity measure based on the edit distance in previous experiments</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>First, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The algorithm uses dynamic programming and, thus, guarantees to find the optimal alignment</a>
