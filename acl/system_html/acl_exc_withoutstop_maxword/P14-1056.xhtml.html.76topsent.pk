VTake, for example, the constraint that the number of number segments does not exceed the number of booktitle segments, as well as the constraint that it does not exceed the number of journal segments
p1
aVSince we truncate penalties at 0, this suggests that we will learn a penalty of 0 for constraints in three categories constraints that do not hold in the ground truth, constraints that hold in the ground truth but are satisfied in practice by performing inference in the base CRF model, and constraints that are satisfied in practice as a side-effect of imposing non-zero penalties on some other constraints
p2
aVHowever, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints
p3
aVThe only one author constraint is particularly useful for correctly labeling editor segments in cases where unconstrained inference mislabels them as author segments
p4
aVThe algorithms we present in later sections for handling soft global constraints and for learning the penalties of these constraints can be applied to general structured linear models, not just CRFs, provided we have an available algorithm for performing MAP inference
p5
aVThe importance score of a constraint provides information about how often it is violated by the CRF, but holds in the ground truth, and a non-zero penalty implies we enforce it as a soft constraint at test time
