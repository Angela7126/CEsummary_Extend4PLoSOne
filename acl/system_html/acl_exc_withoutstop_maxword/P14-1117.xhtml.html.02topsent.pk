VComparing the two approximation strategies shows a clear performance advantage for DP+LP over DP+LP u'\u005cu2192' MST the latter approach entails slower inference due to the overhead of running the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm at every dual update, and furthermore, the error introduced by approximating an integral solution results in a significant decrease in dependency recall

aVFollowing a recent analysis of compression evaluations [ 39 ] which revealed a strong correlation between system compression rate and human judgments of compression quality, we constrained all systems to produce compressed output at a specific rate u'\u005cu2014' determined by the the gold compressions available for each instance u'\u005cu2014' to ensure that the reported differences between the systems under study are meaningful
