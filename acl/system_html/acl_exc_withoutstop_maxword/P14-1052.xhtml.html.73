<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The u'\u201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The immediate value of a state, intuitively, describes closeness of an arbitrary partial sentence to our communicative goal</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because of the structure restriction above (substitution before adjoin), STRUCT generates a valid sentence quickly</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This experiment is set up in the same way as the one above, with the exception of l u'\u201c' distracting u'\u201d' words, words which are not useful in the sentence to be generated l is defined as j - k</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Based on these state and action definitions, the transition function takes a mapping between a partial sentence / action pair and the partial sentences which can result from one particular PLTAG adjoin / substitution, and returns the probability of that rule in the grammar</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this experiment, m u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' x u'\u2062' D u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' p u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' h was set equal</a>
