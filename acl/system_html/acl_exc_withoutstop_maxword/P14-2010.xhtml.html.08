<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>C number of topics on the sprinkled dataset using collapsed Gibbs sampling, where C is the set of class labels of the training documents</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In sprinkling, a set of artificial words are appended to a training document which are specific to the class label of the document</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents</a>
