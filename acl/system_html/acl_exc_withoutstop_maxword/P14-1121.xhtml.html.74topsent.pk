VWe then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora

aVOverall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [ breast cancer corpus 1 ] , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [ diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14 ] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which leads to the introduction of additional noise in the translated context vectors
p2
aVThe main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts

aVAs we can not claim that the prediction of word co-occurrence counts is a linear problem,
