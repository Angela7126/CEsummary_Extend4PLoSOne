<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a naive baseline, we choose one candidate translation at random for each input Urdu sentence</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A candidate is important if 1) it is similar to many of the other proposed candidates and 2) it is authored by better qualified translators and/or post-editors</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This result supports the intuition that a denser collaboration matrix will help propagate saliency to good translators/post-editors and hence provides better predictions for candidate quality</a>
