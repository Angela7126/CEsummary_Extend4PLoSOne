p1
aVWe evaluate the systems using standard F1 on classes of positive, negative, and neutral, where samples predicted as PP and P are positive alignment, and samples tagged as NN and N are negative alignment

aVAs it can be seen, sentiment features obtains the best accuracy among the four types of features

aVFeatures described above mostly depict the global sentiment flow in the discussions
