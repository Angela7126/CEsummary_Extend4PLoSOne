VOn the reasonable assumption that the semantic contribution of the construction did not change, and therefore that all verbs ever attested in it are equally plausible from a semantic point of view, the fact that some verbs joined the distribution later than others is in want of an explanation
p1
aVThese finding support the view that semantic density and type frequency, while they both positively influence syntactic productivity, do so in different ways density defines the necessary conditions for a new coinage to occur, while type frequency increases the confidence that this coinage is indeed possible
p2
aVTo answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information
p3
aVThis measure of density was used as a factor in logistic regression to predict the first occurrence of a verb in the construction, coded as the binary variable Occurrence , set to 1 for the first period in which the verb
