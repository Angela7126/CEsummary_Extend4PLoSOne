<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus far, most lexicon construction approaches focus on constructing general-purpose emotion lexicons [ 11 , 7 , 16 , 4 ]</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For each emotion category, we evaluates it as a binary classification problem</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the evaluation of emotion lexicons, the binary classification is performed in a very simple way</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>These domain-specific words are mostly not included in any other existing general-purpose emotion lexicons</a>
