VThis can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words
p1
aVWe compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice
p2
aVFinnish does not require a table, as all words can be desegmented with simple concatenation
p3
aVWork on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration
p4
aVWe approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words
p5
aVThe first feature indicates that the desegmented morphemes were translated from contiguous source words
p6
aVFortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously by composing the desegmented lattice with a finite state acceptor encoding the LM [ 26 ]
p7
aVA desegmenting transducer can be constructed by first encoding our desegmenter as a table that maps morpheme sequences to words
p8
aVThe lattice (Figure 1 a) can then be desegmented by composing it with the transducer ( 1 b), producing a desegmented lattice ( 1 c

aVThe chains found by this search are
