<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Dual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the most commonly used contemporary approach to character-based segmentation, first proposed by [ 23 ] , CWS is seen as a character sequence tagging task, where each character is tagged on whether it is at the beginning, middle,</a>
