<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this work we suggest a simple, supervised character-level string transduction model which easily incorporates features automatically learned from large amounts of unlabeled data and needs only a limited amount of labeled training data and no lexical resources</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For English, Han and Baldwin ( 12 ) created a small tweet dataset annotated with normalized variants at the word level</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The principal contributions of our work are i) we show that a discriminative sequence labeling model is apt for text normalization and performs at state-of-the-art levels with small amounts of labeled training data; (ii) we show that character-level neural text embeddings can be used to effectively incorporate information from unlabeled data into the model and can substantially boost text normalization performance</a>
