<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We define answer node as the node that is the answer and answer relation as the relation from the answer node to its direct parent</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We treat QA on Freebase as a binary classification task for each node in the topic graph, we extract features and judge whether it is the answer node</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These properties, along with the sibling relationship to the topic node, are important cues for answering the question</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus for the Freebase graph, we use relations (with directions) and properties as features for each node</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unfortunately Freebase does not contain an exact relation called brother , but instead sibling</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given a topic, we selectively roll out the Freebase graph by choosing those nodes within a few hops of relationship to the topic node , and form a topic graph</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We combine question features and Freebase features (per node) by doing a pairwise concatenation</a>
