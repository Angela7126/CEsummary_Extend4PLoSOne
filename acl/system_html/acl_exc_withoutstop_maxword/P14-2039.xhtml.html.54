<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The chunk size directly determines the latency of the system to the end user, as alignment cannot begin until an entire chunk is captured</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second, the fixed window alignment algorithm requires longer chunks ( u'\u2265' 10 seconds) to obtain reasonable accuracy, and thus introduces unsatisfactory latency</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The materials in the output alignment that follow this point is thrown away, and replaced with the output produced by aligning the next chunk starting from this point (line 8</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The A * search algorithm treats each node position n = [ n 1 , u'\u2026' , n K ] as a search state, and estimates the cost function g u'\u2062' ( n ) and the heuristic function h u'\u2062' ( n ) for each state</a>
