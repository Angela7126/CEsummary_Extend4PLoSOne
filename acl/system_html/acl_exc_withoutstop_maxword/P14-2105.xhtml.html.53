<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern u'\u2013' relation and mention u'\u2013' entity pairs, respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The answer to the question can thus be derived by finding the relation u'\u2013' entity triple r u'\u2062' ( e 1 , e 2 ) in the KB and returning the entity not mentioned in the question</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given a pattern and a relation, we compute their relevance score by measuring the cosine similarity between their semantic vectors</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>An example of a single-relation question is u'\u201c' When were DVD players invented u'\u201d' The entity is dvd-player and the relation is be-invent-in</a>
