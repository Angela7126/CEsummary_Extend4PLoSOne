<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As outlined in Table 2 , each ( p , r ) pair would be assigned to one of the classes, solution or non-solution, based on whether it conforms better with the solution models (i.e.,, u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S ) or non-solution models ( u'\ud835' u'\udcae' N u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' N ), as determined using the F u'\u2062' ( ( p , r ) , u'\ud835' u'\udcae' , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ) function, i.e</a>
