<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We then take the Bayesian fusion of this model with the pair LM, by adding them in the log space, to get prediction from both the context and abbreviation model</a>
