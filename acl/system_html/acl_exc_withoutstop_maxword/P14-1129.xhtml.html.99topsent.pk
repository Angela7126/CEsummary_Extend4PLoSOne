VWe treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token
p1
aVFor aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule
p2
aVFor unaligned words, the normal heuristic can also be used, except when the word is on the edge of a rule, because then the target neighbor words are not necessarily known
p3
aVIf t i is unaligned, we inherit its affiliation from the closest aligned word, with preference given to the right
p4
aVOne issue with the S2T NNJM is that the probability is computed over every target word, so it does not explicitly model NULL-aligned source words
p5
aVTo do this, we first say that each target word t i is affiliated with exactly one source word at index a i u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' i is then the m -word source window centered at a i
p6
aVHowever, note that there are only 3 possible positions for each
