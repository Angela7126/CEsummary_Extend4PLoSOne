VIn contrast, our Proposed method predicts the distribution of a word in the target domain, given its distribution in the source domain, thereby explicitly translating the source domain reviews to the target
p1
aVAlthough for illustrative purposes we used the word lightweight , which occurs in both the source and the target domains, our proposed method does not require the source domain distribution w \u005ccS for a word w in a target domain document
p2
aVIn cross-domain POS tagging, WSJ is always the source domain, whereas the five domains in SANCL dataset are considered as the target domains
p3
aVDomain adaptation (DA) of sentiment classification becomes extremely challenging when the distributions of words in the source and the target domains are very different, because the features learnt from the source domain labeled reviews might not appear in the target domain reviews that must be classified
p4
aVBy predicting the distribution of a word across different domains, we can find source domain features that are
