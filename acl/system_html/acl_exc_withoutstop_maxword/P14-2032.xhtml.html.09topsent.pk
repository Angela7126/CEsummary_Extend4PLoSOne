VIn this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition
p1
aVWe also give an updated Viterbi decoding algorithm for CRF and a modified beam-search algorithm for perceptron in Algorithm 2.2
p2
aVThis method is called dual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ]
p3
aVSimilar to previous work [ 13 ] , we solve this DD problem by iteratively updating the sub-gradient as depicted in Algorithm 2.2
