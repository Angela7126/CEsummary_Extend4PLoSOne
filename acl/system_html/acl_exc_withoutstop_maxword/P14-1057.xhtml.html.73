<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>S u'\u2062' ( Q , D ) is the relevance score of D with respect to Q e i denotes a concept, and u'\ud835' u'\udc9c' u'\u2062' ( e ) denotes the query aspect associated with e , i.e.,, a set of concepts that are mapped to the same phrases as e by using MetaMap i u'\u2062' ( e ) is the normalized confidence score of the mapping for concept e generated by MetaMap c u'\u2062' ( e , D ) denotes the occurrences of concept e in document D , d u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' ( e ) denotes the number of documents containing e</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a result, directly applying existing weighting strategies might lead to non-optimal retrieval performance</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al proposed a task-specific representation, i.e.,, using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion method based on the relationships among the medical concepts [ 12 , 13 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Although existing retrieval functions can be directly applied to concept-based representation, they may lead to non-optimal performance</a>
