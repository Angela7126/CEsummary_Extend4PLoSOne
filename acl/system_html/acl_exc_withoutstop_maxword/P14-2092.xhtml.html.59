<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For our skeletal language model, we trained a 5-gram language model on the target-side of the bilingual data by generalizing non-skeleton segments to Xs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Current Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model</a>
