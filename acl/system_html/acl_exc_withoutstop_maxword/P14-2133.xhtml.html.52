<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We began by searching over exponentially-spaced values of u'\u0392' to determine an optimal setting for each training set size; as expected, for small settings of u'\u0392' (corresponding to aggressive smoothing) performance decreased; as we increased the parameter, performance increased slightly before tapering off to baseline parser performance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Word embeddings u'\u2014' representations of lexical items as points in a real vector space u'\u2014' have a long history in natural language processing, going back at least as far as work on latent semantic analysis (LSA) for information retrieval [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While word embeddings can be constructed directly from surface distributional statistics, as in LSA, more sophisticated tools for unsupervised extraction of word representations have recently gained popularity [ 3 , 10 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Intuitively, as u'\u0392' grows small groups of related words will be assigned increasingly similar probabilities of being generated from the same tag (in the limit where u'\u0392' = 0 , Equation 1 is a uniform distribution over the entire vocabulary</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A baseline featured model ( u'\u201c' ident u'\u201d' ) contains only indicator features on word identity (and performs considerably worse than its generative counterpart on small data sets</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A parser which exploited this effect could use this to acquire a robust model of name</a>
