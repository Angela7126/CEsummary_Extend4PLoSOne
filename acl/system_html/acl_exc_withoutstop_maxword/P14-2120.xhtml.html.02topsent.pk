VThe results, presented in Table 4 , first demonstrate the full potential of the implied relationship recognition task to improve textual entailment recognition (Human annotation vs
p1
aVOn the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems
p2
aVFor the scope of this experiment we developed a simple RTE system, which uses the F1 optimized logistic regression classifier of Jansche ( 2005 ) with two features lexical coverage and predicate-argument relationships coverage
p3
aVThis task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic role appears elsewhere and can be inferred from discourse
p4
aVStatistical features in prior works mostly capture general properties of the predicate and the argument, like selectional preferences, lexical similarities, etc
p5
aVOn the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well
p6
aVThis paper addresses a typical sub-task in textual inference scenarios, of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not expressed explicitly through syntactic structure
p7
aVWe suggest, however, that the same challenge, as well as the solutions proposed in our work, are applicable, with proper adaptations, to other textual-inference scenarios, like Question Answering , and Information Extraction (see Section 6
