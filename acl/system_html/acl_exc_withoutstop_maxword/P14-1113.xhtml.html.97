<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We observe that the same property also applies to some hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations and its reverse (hyponym u'\u2013' hypernym) have one-to-one correspondence, their performances are equal</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym pairs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without</a>
