<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data</a>
