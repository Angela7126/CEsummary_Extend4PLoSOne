VOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p1
aVIt is also somewhat similar in spirit to , where a small number of word translation pairs are used to estimate a mapping between distributed representations of words in two different languages and build a word translation model
p2
aVWe did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their dimension when evaluated on source language u'\u005cu2013'
