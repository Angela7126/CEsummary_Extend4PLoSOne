<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The second major row shows the results when we use single 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose a generalized ambiguity-aware ensemble training framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing, which can make better use of unlabeled data, especially when parsers from different views produce divergent syntactic structures</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The first three experiments combine 1-best outputs of two parsers to compose parse forest on unlabeled data u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B+(Z u'\u2229' G) u'\u201d' means that the parse forest is initialized with the Berkeley parse and augmented with the intersection of dependencies of the 1-best outputs of ZPar and GParser</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Results show all the three sets of unlabeled data can help the parser</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Evaluation on labeled data shows the oracle accuracy of parse forest is much higher than that of 1-best outputs of single parsers (see Table 3</a>
