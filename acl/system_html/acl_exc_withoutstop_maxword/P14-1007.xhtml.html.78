<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our algorithm states that for this type of cue (a quantifier) the first step is functor crawling (see 3.3 below), which brings \spred _know_v_1 into the scope</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The main points of difference are in the robustness of the system and in the degree of tailoring of both the rules for determining scope on the logical form level and the rules for handling semantically vacuous elements</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, the string-based annotations also include words which the ERG treats as semantically vacuous</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For negated verbs, the guidelines state that u'\u2018' u'\u2018' If the negated verb is the main verb in the sentence, the entire sentence is in scope u'\u2019' u'\u2019' [ 7 , 17]</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus in order to match the gold annotations, we define a set of heuristics for when to count vacuous words as in scope</a>
