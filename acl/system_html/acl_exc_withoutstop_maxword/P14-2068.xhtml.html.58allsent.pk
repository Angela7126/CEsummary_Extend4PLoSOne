VThis dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message
p1
aVThis enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself
p2
aVHaving obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings
p3
aVThe cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge
p4
aVIn this case, the fact that the predicate indicates a report is not enough to determine the framing different sorts of reports carry radically different perceptions of factuality
p5
aVThe search for reliable signals of information credibility in social media has led to the construction of automatic classifiers to identify credible tweets [ 2 ]
p6
aVThese features are used as predictors in a series of linear ridge regressions, where the dependent variable is the mean certainty rating
p7
aVThe words suggest , think , and believe also purport to describe the private mental state of the source, but their framing function is the opposite of the predicates of knowledge they imply that it is important to mark the claim as the source u'\u005cu2019' s belief, and not a widely-accepted fact
p8
aVDetecting and reasoning about the certainty of propositional content has been identified as a key task for information extraction, and is now supported by the FactBank corpus of annotations for newstext [ 14 ]
p9
aVThese cues carry a substantial amount of framing, as they purport to describe the private mental state of the source
p10
aVWe performed another set of linear regressions, again using the mean certainty rating as the dependent variable
p11
aVWe throw out tweets that were rated as u'\u005cu201c' not applicable u'\u005cu201d' by a majority of raters, but otherwise ignore u'\u005cu201c' not applicable u'\u005cu201d' ratings of the remaining tweets
p12
aVTo ensure quality control we required the Turkers to have at least 85% hit approval rating and to reside in the United States, because the Twitter messages in our dataset were related to American politics
p13
aVOur interest in this text is specifically in quoted content u'\u005cu2014' including u'\u005cu201c' indirect u'\u005cu201d' quotes, which may include paraphrased quotations, as in the examples in Figure 1
p14
aVIn any case, the relevance of these datasets to Twitter text is currently unproven
p15
aVContemporary journalism is increasingly conducted through social media services like Twitter [ 9 , 6 ]
p16
aVWe also allowed for u'\u005cu201c' Not Applicable u'\u005cu201d' option to capture ratings where the Turkers did not have sufficient knowledge about the statement or if the statement was not really a claim
p17
aVAs events unfold, journalists and political commentators use quotes u'\u005cu2014' often indirect u'\u005cu2014' to convey potentially uncertain information and claims from their sources and informants, e.g
p18
aVBoth according and report are often used in conjunction with impersonal and institutional sources, e.g.,, Cuccinelli trails McAuliffe by 24 points , according to a new poll
p19
aVThe word admit often applies to statements that are perceived as damaging to the source, such as Bill Gates admits Control-Alt-Delete was a mistake ; since there can be no self-interest behind such statements, they may be perceived as more likely to be true
p20
aVTherefore, rather than train a supervised model to detect quotations, we apply a simple dependency-based heuristic
p21
aVWe use a combination of regular expressions and dependency rules to capture expressions of the type u'\u005cu201c' claim , according to source u'\u005cu201d' Specifically, the PCOMP path from according is searched for the pattern according to *
p22
aVThis heuristic pipeline may miss many relevant tweets, but since the overall volume is high, we prioritize precision
p23
aVThe ratings were based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from u'\u005cu201c' [-2] Certainly False u'\u005cu201d' to u'\u005cu201c' [2] Certainly True u'\u005cu201d' and allowing for u'\u005cu201c' [0] Uncertain u'\u005cu201d'
p24
aVWhile labeled datasets for such quotes have been created [ 12 , 13 ] , these are not freely available at present
p25
aVFor example, Mubarak clearly believes he has the military leadership u'\u005cu2019' s support
p26
aVIn this case, there was no training/test split, so confidence intervals on the resulting parameters are computed using the analytic closed form
