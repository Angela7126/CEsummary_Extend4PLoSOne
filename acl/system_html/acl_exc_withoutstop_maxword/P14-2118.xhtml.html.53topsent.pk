VWe evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks
p1
aVIn addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p2
aVTo verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al
p3
aVWe conclude by discussing other potential applications of concreteness and subjectivity to NLP
p4
aVFor each noun n we defined its subjectivity profile as the mean of the subjectivity vectors of its modifying adjectives
p5
aVInsight into concreteness can help systems to classify adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p6
aVUsing an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification
p7
aVUnlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ]
p8
aVWe therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u005cu2018' pure u'\u005cu2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives
p9
aVTogether with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness
