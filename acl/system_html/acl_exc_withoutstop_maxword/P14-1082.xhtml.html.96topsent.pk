VWe see that the language model baseline for English u'\u005cu2192' French shows the same substantial improvement over the baseline as our English u'\u005cu2192' Spanish results
p1
aVThe same holds for the Chinese u'\u005cu2192' English experiment
p2
aVAs expected, the LM baseline substantially outperforms the context-insensitive MLF baseline
p3
aVThird, we observe that adding the language model to our classifier leads to another significant gain (configuration l1r1 + LM in the results in Table 2
p4
aVThe auto configuration improves results over the uniformly applied feature selection
p5
aVHowever, if we enable the language model as we do in the auto + LM configuration we do not notice an improvement over l1r1 + LM , surprisingly
p6
aVThis shall be further discussed in Section 6.1
p7
aVPer classifier expert, the best scoring configuration was selected, referred to as the auto configuration in Table 2
p8
aVA context size of one prevails in the vast majority of cases, which is not surprising considering the good results we have already seen with this configuration
p9
aVWe therefore conducted a number of experiments with other language pairs, and present the abridged results in Table 6
p10
aVA second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier
p11
aVThe error rate metrics show improvement as well
p12
aVConclusions with regard to context width may have to be tempered somewhat, as the performance of the l1r1 configuration was found to not be significantly better than that of the l2r2 configuration
p13
aVAutomatic configuration selection was done by performing leave-one-out testing (for small number of instances) or 10-fold-cross validation (for larger number of instances, n u'\u005cu2265' 20 ) on the training data per classifier expert
p14
aVThis baseline, henceforth referred to as the u'\u005cu2019' most likely fragment u'\u005cu2019' baseline (MLF) is analogous to the u'\u005cu2019' most frequent sense u'\u005cu2019' -baseline common in evaluating WSD systems
p15
aVThe language model is a trigram-based back-off language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, computed using SRILM [] and trained on the same training data as the translation model
p16
aVIn order to draw accurate conclusions, experiments on a single data set and language pair are not sufficient
p17
aVThe baseline selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2 fragment according to the phrase-translation table
p18
aVWords or phrases that always map to a single translation are stored in a simple mapping table, as a classifier would have no added value in such cases
p19
aVIf not, we check for the presence of a classifier expert for the offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by extracting the desired number of L2 local context words to the immediate left and right of this fragment and adding those to the feature vector
p20
aVThis intuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem to be better than any other when uniformly applied to
