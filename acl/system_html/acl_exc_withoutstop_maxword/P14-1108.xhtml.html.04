<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Common strategies of these approaches are to either backoff to lower order models when a higher order model lacks sufficient training data for good estimation, to interpolate between higher and lower order models or to interpolate with a prior distribution</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To this end we use text corpora, split them into test and training data, build language models as well as generalized language models over the training data and apply them on the test data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
