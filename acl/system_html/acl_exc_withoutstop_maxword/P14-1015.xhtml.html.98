<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As is the case with any community of humans, discussion forums have their share of inflammatory remarks too</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We will denote the vocabulary size of problem posts as A and that of reply posts as B</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since the first post most usually contains the problem description, identifying its solutions from among the other posts in the thread has been the focus of many recent efforts (e.g.,, [ 8 , 9 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Though most of the answer/solution identification approaches proposed so far in literature are supervised methods that require a labeled training corpus, there are a few that require limited or no supervision</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Being supervised methods, the above assumptions are implicitly factored in by including the appropriate feature (e.g.,, post position in thread) in the feature space so that the learner may learn the correlation (e.g.,, solution posts typically are among the first few posts)</a>
