VInstead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures
p1
aVThe structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic structure of those networks
p2
aVOur ontologization algorithm takes as input a lexicon L and outputs a semantic graph G = ( V , E ) where, as already defined in Section 2 , V is the set of concepts in L and E is the set of semantic relations between these concepts
p3
aVWhen applied to a semantic graph by initializing the random walks from a set of concepts (nodes), ppr yields a vector in which each concept is associated with a weight denoting its
