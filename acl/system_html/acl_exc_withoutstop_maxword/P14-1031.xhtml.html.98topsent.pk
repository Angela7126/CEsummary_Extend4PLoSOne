VIn contrast, both PR l u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' x and PR significantly outperform CRF , which implies that incorporating lexical and discourse constraints as posterior constraints is much more effective
p1
aVThis confirms that encoding lexical and discourse knowledge as posterior constraints allows the feature-based model to gain additional learning power for sentence-level sentiment prediction
p2
aVTo better understand the different effects of lexical and discourse constraints, we report results for applying only the lexical constraints ( CRF-inf l u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' x ) as well as results for applying only the discourse constraints ( CRF-inf d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' c

aVWe can incorporate the proposed constraints (constraints derived from lexical patterns and discourse connectives) as hard constraints into CRF during inference by manually setting u'\u005cu039b' in equation 4 to a large value, 9 9 We set u'\u005cu039b' to 1000 for the lexical constraints and -1000 to the discourse connective constraints in the experiments
