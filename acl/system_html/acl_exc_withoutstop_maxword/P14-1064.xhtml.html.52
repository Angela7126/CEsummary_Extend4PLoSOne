<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The idea presented in this paper is similar in spirit to bilingual lexicon induction (BLI), where a seed lexicon in two different languages is expanded with the help of monolingual corpora, primarily by extracting distributional similarities from the data using word context</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To determine pairwise phrase similarities in order to embed these nodes in their graphs, we utilize the monolingual corpora on both the source and target sides to extract distributional features based on the context surrounding each phrase</a>
