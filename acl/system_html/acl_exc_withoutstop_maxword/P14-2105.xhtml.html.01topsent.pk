aVCNNSM p u'\u005cu2062' m is the full system and consists of two semantic similarity models for pattern u'\u005cu2013' relation and mention u'\u005cu2013' entity

aVBy using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set
p3
aVWe train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern u'\u005cu2013' relation and mention u'\u005cu2013' entity pairs, respectively

aVOur approach in this work can be viewed as a simple semantic parser tailored to single-relation questions, powered by advanced semantic similarity models to handle the paraphrase issue
p6
aVFor each selected relation, the system then checked all triples in the KB that had this relation and computed the similarity score between the mention and corresponding argument entity
