VWe then limit the set of translation options for each unlabeled source phrase (§ 2.3 ), and using a structured graph propagation algorithm, where translation information is propagated from labeled to unlabeled phrases proportional to both source and target phrase similarities, we estimate probability distributions over translations for the unlabeled source phrases (§ 2.4

aVThe morphologically-generated candidates for a given source unlabeled phrase are initially defined as the target word sequences in the monolingual data that have the same stem sequence as one of the baseline u'\u005cu2019' s target translations for a source phrase which has the same stem sequence as the unlabeled source phrase

aVThe morphological generation step adds to the target graph all target word sequences from the monolingual data that map to the same stem sequence
