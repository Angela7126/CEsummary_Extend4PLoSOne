VFurthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2
p1
aVIn this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2
p2
aVWe then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p3
aVHowever, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure
p4
aVThe same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym pairs
p5
aV2009 ) propose a method based on patterns to find hypernyms on arbitrary noun phrases
p6
aVThis paper proposes a novel approach for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings
p7
aVOur previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics
p8
aVA uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym word
