<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This has linguistic interpretations because new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As can be seen from Table 4 , the association model (LRT) remarkably boosts the performance of new word detection, indicating LRT is a key factor for new sentiment word extraction</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In [ 12 ] , new word detection was viewed as a binary classification problem</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The first genre of such studies is to leverage complex linguistic rules or knowledge</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If a candidate word is a new word, it will be more commonly used with diversified lexical patterns since the non-compositionality of new word means that the word can be used in many different linguistic scenarios</a>
