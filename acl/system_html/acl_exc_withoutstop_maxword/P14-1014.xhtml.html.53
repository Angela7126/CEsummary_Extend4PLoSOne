<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\ud835' u'\udc03' of the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The best result achieved by using a 4-gram WRRBM, ( w i - 2 , u'\u2026' , w i + 1 ) , with 300 hidden units learned on 1,000k web domain sentences are shown in row 3 of Table 6</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The averaged accuracies are calculated across the web domain data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The idea of learning representations from unlabelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before [ 26 , 6 , 8 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated</a>
