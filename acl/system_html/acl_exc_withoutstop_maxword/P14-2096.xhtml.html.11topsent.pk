VThe title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector
p1
aVWe can calculate the entropy of the distribution as a value for SVM
p2
aVIn the title similarity method, every Chinese article title is represented as a vector, and each distinct character in all these titles is a dimension of all vectors
p3
aVIn query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia
p4
aVThe similarity values generated by title matching and title similarity are used directly as real value features in the SVM model
p5
aVThen, cosine similarity between this vector and the vector of each Chinese title is measured as title similarity
p6
aVThe first sentence of this article is u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games is a 2008 young adult novel by American writer Suzanne Collins u'\u005cu201d' Since article titles may be named entities or compound nouns, the dependency parser may mislabel them and thus output an incorrect parse tree
