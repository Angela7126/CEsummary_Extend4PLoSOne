VThough coarse-grained tags have their place [ 17 ] , in many cases the distributional and morphological distinctions between words are more closely aligned with the fine-grained tagsets, which typically distinguish between verb tenses, noun number and gender, and adjectival scale (comparative, superlative, etc.), so we feel that the evaluation against fine-grained tagset is more relevant here

aVIn this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model based on the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP; Blei and Frazier, 2011

aVFurther study is also needed to verify that word embeddings effectively capture syntax across languages, and to determine the amount of unlabeled text necessary to learn good embeddings

aVWe find that our model effectively combines morphological features with distributional similarity, outperforming
