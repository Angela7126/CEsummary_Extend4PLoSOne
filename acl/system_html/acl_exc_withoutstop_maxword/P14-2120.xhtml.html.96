<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second, each NI should be classified as Definite NI (DNI) , meaning that the role filler must exist in the discourse, or Indefinite NI otherwise</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>First, some relatively complex steps of the implied SRL task are avoided in our setting, while on the other hand it covers more relevant cases</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text</a>
