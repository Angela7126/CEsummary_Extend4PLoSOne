VIt could be that the distinctions between lexical items that embeddings capture are already modeled by parsers in other ways and therefore provide no further benefit
p1
aVWord embeddings u'\u005cu2014' representations of lexical items as points in a real vector space u'\u005cu2014' have a long history in natural language processing, going back at least as far as work on latent semantic analysis (LSA) for information retrieval [ 4 ]
p2
aVAs described above, the full featured model adds indicator features on the bucketed value of each dimension of the word embedding
p3
aVWhile word embeddings can be constructed directly from surface distributional statistics, as in LSA, more sophisticated tools for unsupervised extraction of word representations have recently gained popularity [ 3 , 10 ]
p4
aVSemi-supervised and unsupervised models for a variety of core NLP tasks, including named-entity recognition [ 5 ] , part-of-speech tagging [ 13 ] , and chunking [ 15 ] have been shown to benefit from the inclusion of word embeddings as features
p5
aVHere, the trend observed in the other two models is even more prominent u'\u005cu2014' embedding features lead to improvements over the featured baseline, but in no case outperform the standard baseline with a generative lexicon
p6
aVA baseline featured model ( u'\u005cu201c' ident u'\u005cu201d' ) contains only indicator features on word identity (and performs considerably worse than its generative counterpart on small data sets
p7
aVIn this paper, we investigate this question empirically, by isolating three potential mechanisms for improvement from pre-trained word embeddings
p8
aVThis paper investigates a variety of ways in which word embeddings might augment a constituency parser with a discrete state space
p9
aVWe use the Maryland implementation of the Berkeley parser as our baseline for the kernel-smoothed lexicon, and the Maryland featured parser as our baseline for the embedding-featured lexicon
p10
aVApparent gains from the OOV and lexicon pooling models remain so small as to be statistically indistinguishable
p11
aVWord embeddings are useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words, because they automatically ensure that unknown words are treated the same way as known words with similar representations
p12
aVWord embeddings are useful for handling in-vocabulary words, by making it possible to pool statistics for related words
p13
aVIn the other direction, access to a syntactic parse has been shown to be useful for constructing word embeddings for phrases compositionally [ 7 , 1 ]
p14
aVTo evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding
p15
aVWe begin by investigating the OOV model
p16
aVWe take the best-performing combination of all of these models (based on development experiments, a combination of the lexical pooling model with u'\u005cu0392' = 0.3 , and OOV, both using c w word embeddings), and evaluate this on the WSJ test set (Table 2
p17
aVAs can be seen, this model alone achieves small gains over the baseline for a 300-word training corpus, but these gains become statistically insignificant with more training data
p18
aVThis ensures that our model continues to include the original Berkeley parser model as a limiting case
p19
aVA parser which exploited this effect could use this to acquire a robust model of name behavior by sharing statistics from all first names together, preventing low counts from producing noisy models of names
p20
aVIf we want to encourage similarly-embedded words to exhibit similar behavior in the generative model, we need to ensure that the are preferentially mapped onto the same latent preterminal tag
p21
aVThe first block in Table 1 shows the best settings of u'\u005cu0392' for each corpus size; as can be seen, this also gives a small improvement on the 300-sentence training corpus, but no discernible once the system has access to a few thousand labeled sentences
p22
aVEach u'\u005cu0391' t , w is learned in the same way as its corresponding probability in the original parser model u'\u005cu2014' during each M step of the training procedure, u'\u005cu0391' w , t is set to the expected number of times the word w appears under the refined tag t
p23
aVAs in the OOV model, we also need to worry about how to handle words for which we have no vector representation
p24
aVIn these cases, we simply treat the words as if their vectors were so far away from everything else they had no influence, and report their weights as p ( w t ) = u'\u005cu0391' w
p25
aVAs u'\u005cu0392' grows large words become more independent (and in the limit where u'\u005cu0392' = u'\u005cu221e' , each summand in Equation 1 is zero except where w u'\u005cu2032' = w , and we recover the original direct-lookup model
p26
aVThe extensions we propose are certainly not the only way to target the hypotheses described above, but they have the advantage of being minimal and straightforwardly interpretable, and each can be reasonably expected to improve parser performance if its corresponding hypothesis is true
p27
aVEmpirically, taking k = 20 gives adequate performance, and increasing it does not seem to alter the behavior of the parser
p28
aVWe began by searching over exponentially-spaced values of u'\u005cu0392' to determine an optimal setting for each training set size; as expected, for small settings of u'\u005cu0392' (corresponding to aggressive smoothing) performance decreased; as we increased the parameter, performance increased slightly before tapering off to baseline parser performance
p29
aVIntuitively, as u'\u005cu0392' grows small groups of related words will be assigned increasingly similar probabilities of being generated from the same tag (in the limit where u'\u005cu0392' = 0 , Equation 1 is a uniform distribution over the entire vocabulary
p30
aVPer-corpus-size settings of the parameter u'\u005cu0392' are set by searching over several possible settings on the development set
p31
aVOur first task is thus to design a set of orthogonal experiments which make it possible to test each of the three hypotheses in isolation
p32
aVThus we have two questions
p33
aVBut we don u'\u005cu2019' t know how prevalent or important such u'\u005cu201c' syntactic axes u'\u005cu201d' are in practice
p34
aVDependency parsers have seen gains from distributional statistics in the form of discrete word clusters [ 9 ] , and recent work [ 2 ] suggests that similar gains can be derived from embeddings like the ones used in this paper
p35
aVFor OOV words which are not in the dictionary of embeddings, we back off to the unknown word model for the underlying parser
p36
aVThe Maryland parser builds on the state-splitting parser, replacing its basic word emission model with a feature-rich, log-linear representation of the lexicon
p37
aVIn order to isolate the contribution from word embeddings, it is useful to demonstrate improvement over a parser that already achieves state-of-the-art performance without vector representations
p38
aVIn order to focus specifically on the effect of word embeddings, we remove the morphological features from the parser, but retain indicators on the identity of each lexical item
p39
aVTo evaluate the vocabulary expansion hypothesis, we introduce a simple but targeted out-of-vocabulary (OOV) model in which every unknown word is simply replaced by its nearest neighbor in the training set
p40
aVWith extremely limited training data, parser extensions using word embeddings give modest improvements in accuracy (relative error reduction on the order of 1.5%
p41
aVThe Berkeley lexicon stores, for each latent (tag, word) pair, the probability p ( w t ) directly in a lookup table
p42
aVLast we consider a model with a featured lexicon, as described in Huang and Harper ( 2011
p43
aVNext we consider the lexicon pooling model
p44
aVWe hypothesize that dependency parsers benefit from the introduction of features (like clusters and embeddings) that provide syntactic abstractions; but that constituency parsers already have access to such abstractions in the form of supervised preterminal tags
p45
aVIt seems clear that word embeddings exhibit some syntactic structure
p46
aVFor the experiments in this paper, we will use the Berkeley parser [ 12 ] and the related Maryland parser [ 8 ]
p47
aVHowever, with reasonably-sized training corpora, performance does not improve even when a wide variety of embedding methods, parser modifications, and parameter settings are considered
p48
aVThe fact that word embedding features result in nontrivial gains for discriminative dependency parsing [ 2 ] , but do not appear to be effective for constituency parsing, points to an interesting structural difference between the two tasks
p49
aVWe are interested in the question of whether a state-of-the-art discrete-variable constituency parser can be improved with word embeddings, and, more precisely, what aspect (or aspects) of the parser can be altered to make effective use of embeddings
p50
aVThe structure of the space used for the embeddings directly encodes syntactic information in its coordinate axes
p51
aVWe observe very small (but statistically significant) gains with 300 and 3000 train sentences, but a decrease in performance on the full corpus
p52
aVThere certainly exist competitive parsers that internally represent lexical items as real-valued vectors, such as the neural network-based parser of Henderson ( 2004 ) , and even parsers which use pre-trained word embeddings to represent the lexicon, such as Socher et al
p53
aVHow much data is needed to learn them without word embeddings
p54
aVBut its distributional representation is very close to the known word hello , and a model capable of mapping hey to its neighbor should be able to assign the right tag
p55
aVLuckily, the exponential decay of the kernel ensures that each word shares most of its weight with a small number of close neighbors, and almost none with words farther away
p56
aVThe fundamental question we want to explore is whether embeddings provide any information beyond what a conventional parser is able to induce from labeled parse trees
p57
aVEmbedding structure hypothesis
p58
aVIn these parsers, however, use of word vectors is a structural choice, rather than an added feature, and it is difficult to disentangle whether vector-space lexicons are actually more powerful than their discrete analogs u'\u005cu2014' perhaps the performance of neural network parsers comes entirely from the model u'\u005cu2019' s extra-lexical syntactic structure
p59
aVwith Z a normalizing constant to ensure that p ( u'\u005cu22c5' t ) sums to one over the entire vocabulary u'\u005cu03a6' u'\u005cu2062' ( w ) is the vector representation of the word w , u'\u005cu0391' t , w are per-basis weights, and u'\u005cu0392' is an inverse radius parameter which determines the strength of the smoothing
p60
aVSecond, and more importantly, the fact that they use no continuous state representations internally makes it easy to design experiments that isolate the contributions of word vectors, without worrying about effects from real-valued operators higher up in the model
p61
aVUpon encountering the unknown word hey , the parser assigns a low posterior probability of having been generated from UH
p62
aVTo investigate the possibility that improvements from embeddings are exceptionally difficult to achieve on the Wall Street Journal corpus, or on English generally, we perform (1) a domain adaptation experiment, in which we use the OOV and lexicon pooling models to train on WSJ and test on the first 4000 sentences of the Brown corpus (the u'\u005cu201c' WSJ u'\u005cu2192' Brown u'\u005cu201d' column in Table 3 ), and (2) a multilingual experiment, in which we train and test on the French treebank (the u'\u005cu201c' French u'\u005cu201d' column
p63
aVExample individual first names are also rare in the treebank, but tend to cluster together in distributional representations
p64
aV1 1 Both downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/umd-featured-parser/ For all experiments, we use 50-dimensional word embeddings
p65
aVFirst, these parsers are among the best in the literature, with a test performance of 90.7 F 1 for the baseline Berkeley parser on the Wall Street Journal corpus (compared to 90.4 for Socher et al
p66
aVTo exploit this, we pre-compute the k -nearest-neighbor graph of points in the embedding space, and take the sum in Equation 1 only over this set of nearest neighbors
p67
aVIt has been less clear how (and indeed whether) word embeddings in and of themselves are useful for constituency parsing
p68
aVFor each dimension i , we create an indicator feature corresponding to the linearly-bucketed value of the feature at that index
p69
aVThese are precisely the kinds of distinctions between determiners that state-splitting in the Berkeley parser has shown to be useful [ 12 ] , and existing work [ 11 ] has observed that such regular embedding structure extends to many other parts of speech
p70
aVThis allows the parser to distinguish between words which share the same tag but exhibit very different syntactic behavior u'\u005cu2014' for example, between articles and demonstrative pronouns
p71
aVThere are computational concerns associated with this approach the original scoring procedure for a (word, tag) pair was a single (constant-time) lookup; here it might take time linear in the size of the vocabulary
p72
aVAre such groupings (learned on large data sets but from less syntactically rich models) better than the ones the parser finds on its own
p73
aVTo evaluate the statistic sharing hypothesis, we propose a novel smoothing technique
p74
aVWe consider three general hypotheses about how embeddings might interact with a parser
p75
aVConsider Figure 1 , which shows embeddings for a variety of English determiners, projected onto their first two principal components
p76
aVFor each training corpus size we also choose a different setting of the number of splitting iterations over which the Berkeley parser is run; for 300 sentences this is two splits, and for 3000 four splits
p77
aVWe prepare three training sets the complete training set of 39,832 sentences from the treebank (sections 2 through 21), a smaller training set, consisting of the first 3000 sentences, and an even smaller set of the first 300
p78
aVVarious model-specific experiments are shown in Table 1

aV2011 ) ; embeddings labeled cbow are from Mikolov et al
p80
aVEmbeddings labeled c w are from Collobert et al
p81
aVStatistic sharing hypothesis
p82
aVThis behavior is almost completely insensitive to the choice of embedding
p83
aVThe Berkeley parser induces a latent, state-split PCFG in which each symbol V of the (observed) X-bar grammar is refined into a set of more specific symbols { V 1 , V 2 , u'\u005cu2026' } which capture more detailed grammatical behavior
p84
aVWe would expect a feature corresponding to a word u'\u005cu2019' s position along this axis to be a useful feature in a feature-based lexicon
p85
aVConsistent with the existing literature, we stop at six splits when using the full training corpus
p86
aVVocabulary expansion hypothesis
p87
aVIn order to do this, we replace this direct lookup with a smoothed, kernelized lexicon, where
p88
aVNote that these hypotheses are not all mutually exclusive, and two or all of them might provide independent gains
p89
aVExample with the exception of a , the vertical axis in Figure 1 seems to group words by definiteness
p90
aVThis is necessary to avoid overfitting on smaller training sets
p91
aVThe choice of this parser family has two motivations
p92
aVWe consider the following extensions
p93
aVIt is also possible that other mechanisms are at play that are not covered by these three hypotheses, but we consider these three to be likely central effects
