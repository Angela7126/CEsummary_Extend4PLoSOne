<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we show that learners could use Bayesian model selection to determine that function words appear on the left periphery in English by comparing the marginal probability of the data for the left-periphery and the right-periphery models</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By comparing the posterior probability of two models u'\u2014' one in which function words appear at the left edges of phrases, and another in which function words appear at the right edges of phrases u'\u2014' we show that a learner could use Bayesian posterior probabilities to determine that function words appear at the left edges of phrases in English, even though they are not told the locations of word boundaries or which words are function words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This suggests that there are acquisition advantages to treating function words specially that human learners could take advantage of (at least to the extent that they are learning similar generalisations as our models), and thus supports the hypothesis that function words are treated specially in human lexical acquisition</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Experimental evidence suggests that infants as young as 8 months of age already expect function words on the correct side for their language u'\u2014' left-periphery for Italian infants and right-periphery for Japanese infants [] u'\u2014' so it is interesting to see whether purely distributional learners such as the ones studied here can identify the correct location of function words in phrases</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We do this by comparing two computational models of word segmentation which differ solely in the way that they model function words</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This question is important because knowing the side where function words preferentially occur is related to the question of the direction of syntactic headedness in the language, and an accurate method for identifying the location of function words might be useful for initialising a syntactic learner</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Presumably this is because it tends to misanalyse multi-syllabic words on the right periphery as sequences of monosyllabic words</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, it is plausible that function words play a crucial role in children u'\u2019' s acquisition of more complex syntactic phenomena [] , so it is interesting to investigate the roles they might play in computational models of language acquisition</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Section 2.3 presents the major novel contribution of this paper by explaining how we modify these adaptor grammars to capture some of the special properties of function words</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Perhaps the simplest word segmentation model is the unigram model , where utterances are modeled as sequences of words, and where each word is a sequence of segments []</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As a reviewer points out, we present no evidence that</a>
