<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A distributional thesaurus is a lexical network that lists semantic neighbours, computed from a corpus and a similarity measure between lexical items, which generally captures the similarity of contexts in which the items occur</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A distributional thesaurus includes a lot of u'\u201c' noise u'\u201d' from a semantic point of view, but also lists relevant lexical pairs that escape classical lexical relations such as synonymy or hypernymy</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We will talk of lexical neighbours or distributional neighbours to label pairs of predicates or arguments, and in the rest of the paper we consider only lexical pairs with a Lin score of at least 0.1, which means about 1.4M pairs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We present the experiments we set up to automatically filter semantic relations in context, with various groups of features that take into account information from the corpus used to build the thesaurus and contextual information related to occurrences of semantic neighbours 3</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We hypothetize that evaluating and filtering semantic relations in texts where lexical items occur would help tasks that naturally make use of semantic similarity relations, but assessing this goes beyond the present work</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For the preliminary test, we asked three annotators to judge the similarity of pairs of lexical items without any context ( no-context ), and to judge the similarity of pairs presented within a paragraph where they both occur ( in context</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can draw the tentative conclusion that the quality of distributional relations depends on the contextualizing of the related lexical items, beyond just the similarity score and the ranks of items as neighbours of other items</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations</a>
