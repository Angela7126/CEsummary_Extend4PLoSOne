VTaking an approach different from previous studies, we formulate the task of assigning a score of syntactic complexity to a spoken response as a classification problem given a spoken response, assign the response to a proficiency class
p1
aVThe performance gain of Base+cos4 over Base , however, is not statistically significant at level = 0.01
p2
aVAs a result, measures of grammatical complexity that are closely tied to a correct syntactic analysis are rendered unreliable
p3
aVSeeking to study the robustness of the measures derived using a shallow analysis, we next compare the two measures studied here, with respect to the impact of speech recognition errors on their correlation with scores of syntactic complexity
p4
aVThe effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency
p5
aVChen and Zechner ( 2011 ) found that while using measures of syntactic complexity obtained from transcriptions, errors in ASR transcripts caused over 0.40 drop in correlation from that found with manual
