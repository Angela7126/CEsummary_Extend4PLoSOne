<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Subsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u2062' ( r</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the (deterministic) tag for each word as its descriptor</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we augment our existing model with standard sentiment analysis features that look at unigrams and bigrams in the span [ 31 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>An anchored rule r is the conjunction of an unanchored grammar rule rule u'\u2062' ( r ) and the start, stop, and split indexes where that rule is anchored, which we refer to as span u'\u2062' ( r</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, the first word in a constituent is a surface property, as is the word directly preceding the constituent</a>
