<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In a shallow-analysis approach to measuring syntactic complexity, we rely on the distribution of POS bigrams at every proficiency level to be representative of the range and sophistication of grammatical constructions at that level</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The measure of syntactic complexity of a response, c u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' s 4 , is its similarity to the highest score class</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we compare the discriminative ability of measures of syntactic complexity (VSM-model based measure with that of the MaxEnt-based measure) across proficiency levels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Additionally, we compare the performance of an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency that includes the measures of syntactic complexity from each of the two models being compared and analyze the gains with respect to the state-of-the-art</a>
