(lp0
VTo avoid this problem, we removed the background by using background subtraction techniques and manually selected thresholds
p1
aVFor example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background
p2
aVPart of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers
p3
aVGiven the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows
p4
aVWe call both the centroids and filters as the learned features
p5
aVThis accuracy is so high that current research has shifted to related more challenging problems language variety identification [ 26 ] , native language identification [ 24 ] and identification at the extremes of scales; many more languages, smaller training data, shorter document lengths [ 1 ]
p6
aVThe second reason for data preprocessing is to make the input size smaller and uniform
p7
aVThe same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions
