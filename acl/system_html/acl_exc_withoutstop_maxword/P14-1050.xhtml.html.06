<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The algorithm works as follows starting from very few seed words (for example, a word in Table 1 ), the algorithm can find lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words in which the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to quantify the degree of association</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Starting from very few seed words (for example, just one seed word), we can extract lexical patterns that have strong statistical association with the seed words; the extracted lexical patterns can be further used in finding more new words, and the most probable new words can be added into the seed word set for the next iteration; and the process can be run iteratively until a stop condition is met</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We investigate the problem of polarity prediction of new sentiment word and demonstrate that inclusion of new sentiment word benefits sentiment classification tasks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>From linguistic perspectives, new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns</a>
