VIn particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e.,, links among mentions within entities) and response coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e.,, links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account
p1
aVSince there is no non-coreference link, BLANC reduces to the coreference F-measure F c
p2
aVSince there is no coreference link, BLANC reduces to the non-coreference F-measure F n
p3
aVIt calculates recall, precision and F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and defines the overall recall, precision and F-measure as the mean of the respective measures for coreference and non-coreference
