VAll words in the top 100 words can be used as feature we thus manually label the polarity of all top 100 words (we did NOT remove incorrect new word

aVA lexical pattern is a triplet A D , * , A U , where A u'\u005cu2062' D is an adverbial word, the wildcard * means an arbitrary number of words 1 1 We set the number to 3 words in this work considering computation costs and A u'\u005cu2062' U denotes an auxiliary word
p2
aVBy looking into the pattern set and the selected words at each iteration, we found that the pattern set ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcab' ) converges soon to the same set after a few iterations; and at the beginning several iterations, the selected words are almost the same although the order of adding the words is different

aVIn these works, new word detection is considered as an integral part of segmentation, where new words are identified as the most probable segments inferred by the probabilistic models; and the detected new word can be further
