<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For all three games, two players play the same game under time limits and then are rewarded if their answers match</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Quality Enforcement Mechanisms Similar to Infection, TKT includes analogous mechanisms for limiting adversarial player annotations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
