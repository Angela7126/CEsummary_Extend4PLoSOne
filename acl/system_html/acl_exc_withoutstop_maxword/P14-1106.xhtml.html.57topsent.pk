VIt shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board
p1
aVOne is based on the leftmost aligned word (leftmost reordering model) and the other is based on the rightmost aligned word (rightmost reordering model), as follows
p2
aVThe syntactic reordering model takes a CFG rule (e.g.,, VP u'\u005cu2192' VP u'\u005cu2062' PP u'\u005cu2062' PP ) and models the reordering of the constituents on the left hand side by examining their translation or visit order according to the target language
p3
aVOf all the semantic role pairs, 44% are in the same CFG rules, indicating that this part of semantic reordering has overlap with syntactic reordering
p4
aVOnce we have the (semi-)gold
