<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>From a computational perspective, adding non-sparse vectors directly as features, including their combinations, can significantly increase the number of active features for scoring syntactic structures (e.g.,, dependency arc</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This framework enables us to learn new syntactically guided embeddings while also leveraging separately estimated word vectors as starting features, leading to improved parsing performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Syntactic relations manifest themselves in a broad range of surface indicators, ranging from morphological to lexical, including positional and part-of-speech (POS) tagging features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This research is developed in collaboration with the Arabic Language Technoligies (ALT) group at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) within the lyas project</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Following standard machine learning practices, these algorithms iteratively select a subset of features by optimizing parsing performance on a development set</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Tensors are increasingly used as tools in spectral estimation [ 15 ] , including in parsing [ 6 ] and other NLP problems [ 10 ] , where the goal is to avoid local optima in maximum likelihood estimation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We obtain role-dependent low-dimensional representations for words (head, modifier) that are specifically tailored for parsing accuracy, and use standard online algorithms</a>
