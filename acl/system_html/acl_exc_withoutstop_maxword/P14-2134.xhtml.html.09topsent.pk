p1
aVFor comparison, we also partition the data among all 51 states, and train a single model for each state using only data from that state
p2
aVWhile the two models that include geographical information naturally outperform the model that does not, the Joint model generally far outperforms the Individual models trained on state-specific subsets of the data
p3
aVcity
p4
aVThis model defines a joint parameterization over all variable values in the data, where information from data originating in California, for instance, can influence the representations learned for Wisconsin; a naive alternative would be to simply train individual models on each variable value (a u'\u005cu201c' California u'\u005cu201d' model using data only from California, etc
p5
aV1 1 This result is robust to the choice of distance metric; an evaluation measuring the Euclidean distance between vectors shows the Joint model to outperform the Individual and u'\u005cu2013' Geo models across all seven categories
p6
aVWe evaluate our model by confirming its face validity in a qualitative analysis and estimating its accuracy at the quantitative task of judging geographically-informed semantic similarity
p7
aVA model that can exploit all of the information in the data, learning core vector-space representations
