VFor each pair neighbour a / neighbour b , we computed a set of features from Wikipedia (the corpus used to derive the distributional similarity
p1
aVWe present the experiments we set up to automatically filter semantic relations in context, with various groups of features that take into account information from the corpus used to build the thesaurus and contextual information related to occurrences of semantic neighbours 3
p2
aVThe outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable
p3
aVA distributional thesaurus is a lexical network that lists semantic neighbours, computed from a corpus and a similarity measure between lexical items, which generally captures the similarity of contexts in which the items occur
p4
aVWe used this dataset to set up a supervised classification experiment in order to automatically predict the relevance of a semantic link in a given discourse
p5
aVThe last set of features derive from the occurrences of related tokens in the considered discourses
p6
aVA few other contextual features are included in the model the distances between pairs of related items, instantiated as
p7
aVdistance in words between occurrences of related word types
p8
aVFinally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features
p9
aVThey can be divided in three groups, according to their origin they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated
p10
aVWe present now the list of features that were used for the model
p11
aVA distributional thesaurus includes a lot of u'\u005cu201c' noise u'\u005cu201d' from a semantic point of view, but also lists relevant lexical pairs that escape classical lexical relations such as synonymy or hypernymy
p12
aVFor the preliminary test, we asked three annotators to judge the similarity of pairs of lexical items without any context ( no-context ), and to judge the similarity of pairs presented within a paragraph where they both occur ( in context
p13
aVA straightforward parameter to include to predict the relevance of a link is of course the similarity measure itself, here Lin u'\u005cu2019' s information measure
p14
aVWe hypothetize that evaluating and filtering semantic relations in texts where lexical items occur would help tasks that naturally make use of semantic similarity relations, but assessing this goes beyond the present work
p15
aVFigure 4 shows examples of self-connected components in an excerpt of the page on Gorille (gorilla), e.g., the set { pelage, dos, fourrure } (coat, back, fur
p16
aVThe resulting feature we used is the product of this measure for neighbour a and neighbour b
p17
aVWe also measured the syntagmatic association of neighbour a and neighbour b , with a mutual information measure [] , computed from the cooccurrence of two tokens within the same paragraph in Wikipedia
p18
aVIn order to evaluate the resource, we set up an annotation in context pairs of lexical items are to be judged in their context of use, in texts where they occur together
p19
aVOur task is to identify relevant similarities between lexical items, between all possible related pairs, and we want to train an inductive model, a classifier, to extract the relevant links
p20
aVWe can draw the tentative conclusion that the quality of distributional relations depends on the contextualizing of the related lexical items, beyond just the similarity score and the ranks of items as neighbours of other items
p21
aVWe similarly defined a tf u'\u005cu22c5' ipf measure based on the frequency of a word within a paragraph with respect to its frequency within the text
p22
aVFirst, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product
p23
aVdos
p24

p25
aVThis is the number of pairs (present in the text) where a lemma appears in

aVeach neighbour productivity p u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' d a and p u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' d b are defined as the numbers of neighbours of respectively neighbour a and neighbour b in the database (thus related tokens with a similarity above the threshold), from which we derive three features as for frequencies the min, the max, and the log of the product
p31
aVFigure 3 shows the influence of the threshold value to select relevant pairs, when considering precision and recall of the pairs that are kept when choosing the threshold, evaluated against the human annotation of relevance in context
p32
aVWe will talk of lexical neighbours or distributional neighbours to label pairs of predicates or arguments, and in the rest of the paper we consider only lexical pairs with a Lin score of at least 0.1, which means about 1.4M pairs
p33
aVIl faut aussi mentionner leurs lignes noires uniques à chaque individu au bout des oreilles , sur le dos de la queue et sur le front
p34
aVthe ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u005cu2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u005cu2019' s score; r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' g b - a is defined similarly and again we consider as features the min, max and log-product of these ranks
p35
aVAs a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u005cu2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22
p36
aVThe method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u005cu201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u005cu201d'

aVfor the no-context annotation, candidate pairs had a Lin score above 0.2 , which placed them in the top 14 u'\u005cu2062' % of lexical neighbours with respect to the similarity level
p43
aVSeveral variants of tf u'\u005cu22c5' idf have been proposed to adapt the measure to more local areas in a text with respect to the whole document
p44
aVThey were asked to judge the relation between two items types, regardless of the number of occurrences in the text
p45
aVOne advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations
p46
aVLe
p47
aVThe filtering approach we propose seems to yield good results, by augmenting the similarity built on the whole corpus with signals from the local contexts and documents where related lexical items appear together
p48
aVWe add two categorial features, of a more linguistic nature
p49
aVWe do this by judging the relevance of a lexical relation in a context where both elements of a lexical pair occur
p50
aVIntrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects []
p51
aVWe differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u005cu201c' existential u'\u005cu201d' view of semantic relatedness
p52
aVThe first thing we can analyse from the annotated data is the impact of a threshold on Lin u'\u005cu2019' s score to select relevant lexical pairs
p53
aVc u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' s is the pair of part-of-speech for the related items, e.g., to distinguish the relevance of NN or VV pairs
p54
aVTo verify that this methodology is useful, we did a preliminary annotation to contrast judgment on lexical pairs with or without this contextual information
p55
aVThen we consider a tf u'\u005cu22c5' idf [] measure, to evaluate the specificity and arguably the importance of a word in a document or within a document
p56
aVThis can be considered as a baseline for extraction of relevant lexical pairs, to which we turn in the following section

aVLe gorille est après le bonobo et le chimpanzé , du
p58
aVExtrinsic evaluations measure the capacity of a system in which a resource or a component to evaluate has been used, for instance in this case information retrieval [] or word sense disambiguation []
p59
aVThis is a rather large window, and thus gives a good coverage with respect to the neighbour database (70% of all pairs

aVa boolean feature c u'\u005cu2062' c saying whether a lexical pair belongs to a connected component of the text, except the largest
p61
aVPearson correlation factor shows that Lin score is indeed significantly correlated to the annotated relevance of lexical pairs, albeit not strongly ( r = 0.159
p62
aVWe tested a few popular machine learning methods, and report on two of them, a naive bayes model and the best method on our dataset, the Random Forest classifier []
p63
aVIn case one wants to optimize the F-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) when extracting relevant pairs, we can see that the optimal point is at .24 for a threshold of .22 on Lin u'\u005cu2019' s score
p64
aVAs for improving distributional thesauri, outside of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial thesaurus is built [] , or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given target []
p65
aVThis reflects the fact that a small component may concern a lexical field which is more specific and thus more relevant to the text
p66
aVFor the larger annotation, the protocol was slightly changed two annotators were given 42 full texts from the original corpus where lexical neighbours occurred
p67
aVWe use a distributional resource for French, built on a 200M word corpus extracted from the French Wikipedia, following principles laid out in [] from a structured model [] , i.e., using syntactic contexts
p68
aVThe similarity of distributions was computed with Lin u'\u005cu2019' s score []
p69
aVfor the in context annotation, the only constraint was that the pairs occur in the same paragraph somewhere in the corpus used to build the resource
p70
aVThe idea is that neighbours whith very high productivity give rise to less reliable relations

aVFinally we discuss some related work on the evaluation and improvement of distributional resources (section 4

aVFor Random Forests, we chose to have ten trees, and each decision is taken on a randomly chosen set of five features
p75
aVTo address class imbalance, two broad types of methods can be applied to help the model focus on the minority class
p76
aVThis time there was no filtering of the lexical pairs beyond the 0.1 threshold of the original resource
p77
aVThey are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard []

aVFor instance [] propose a tf u'\u005cu22c5' isf ( term frequency u'\u005cu22c5' inverse sentence frequency ), for topic segmentation
p81
aVEven with respect to established lexical resources, distributional approaches may improve coverage, complicating the evaluation even more
p82
aVOur work is related to two issues evaluating distributional resources, and improving them
p83
aVIt is not easy to decide if the non-relevant pairs are just noise, or context-dependent associations that were not present in the actual text considered (for polysemy reasons for instance), or just low-level associations
p84
aVIt turns out that the kappa score ( 0.80 ) shows a better inter-annotator agreement than during the preliminary test, which can be explained by the larger context given to the annotator (the whole text), and thus more occurrences of each element in the pair to judge, and also because the annotators were more experienced after the preliminary test
p85
aVAn excerpt of an example text, as it was presented to the annotators, is shown figure 2
p86
aVOverall, it took only a few days to annotate 9885 pairs of lexical items
p87
aVThe random forest model is significantly improved by the balancing techniques the overall best F-score of 46.3% is reached with Random Forests and the cost-aware learning method
p88
aVWe have seen that the relevant/not relevant classification is very imbalanced, biased towards the u'\u005cu201c' not relevant u'\u005cu201d' category (about 11%/89%), so we applied methods dedicated to counter-balance this, and will focus on the precision and recall of the predicted relevant links
p89
aVThis seems to validate the feasability of a reliable annotation of relatedness in context, so we went on for a larger annotation with two of the previous annotators
p90
aVThus there is no need for a syntactic analysis of the context considered when exploiting the resource, and sparsity is less of an issue 1 1 Whenever two predicates with the same lemma have common neighbours, we average the score of the pairs
p91
aVThe goal of the work presented in this paper is to improve distributional thesauri, and to help evaluate the content of such resources
p92
aVBut this can be complemented by additional information on the similarity of the neighbours, namely
p93
aVAmong the pairs that were presented to the annotators, about 11% were judged as relevant by the annotators
p94
aVFor cost-aware learning, a sensible choice is to invert the class ratio for the cost ratio, i.e., here the cost of a mistake on a relevant link (false negative) is exactly 8.5 times higher than the cost on a non-relevant link (false positive), as non-relevant instances are 8.5 times more present than relevant ones
p95
aVaverage distance ( a u'\u005cu2062' d ) ;
p96
aVWe are not aware of any work that would try to evaluate differently semantic neighbours according to the context they appear in
p97
aVThe resource itself is built by choosing a cut-off which is supposed to keep pairs with a satisfactory similarity, but this threshold is rather arbitrary
p98
aVWe followed the well-known postulate [] that all occurrences of a word in the same discourse tend to have the same sense ( u'\u005cu201c' one sense per discourse u'\u005cu201d' ), in order to decrease the annotator workload

aVpoint
p106
aVThis is to keep the predicate/argument distinction since similarities will be computed between predicate pairs or argument pairs, and a lexical item can appear in many predicates and as an argument (e.g., interest as argument, interest_for as one predicate
p107
aVThere is a classical dichotomy when evaluating NLP components between extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations [] , and this applies to distributional thesauri []

aVFor resampling, Smote advises to double the number of instances of the minority class, and we observed that a bigger resampling degrades performances

aVIf we take the best simple classifier (random forests), the precision and recall are 68.1 u'\u005cu2062' % and 24.2 u'\u005cu2062' % for an F-score of 35.7 u'\u005cu2062' % , and this is significantly beaten by the Naive Bayes method as precision and recall are more even (F-score of 41.5%

aVfemelles
p116
aVAlso note that predicting every link as relevant would result in a 2.6% precision, and thus a 5% F-score
p117
aVFor each annotation, 100 pairs were randomly selected, with the following constraints
p118
aVEvaluating distributional resources is the subject of a lot of methodological reflection [] , and as we said in the introduction, evaluations can be divided between extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations
p119
aVThis is already a big improvement on the use of the similarity measure alone (24%
p120
aVOther popular methods (maximum entropy, SVM) have shown slightly inferior combined F-score, even though precision and recall might yield more important variations
p121
aVWe tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of [] as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method MetaCost of [] as a cost-aware learning method
p122

p123
aVWe nonetheless assume that some of the relevant pairs would appear in other thesauri, or would be of interest in an evaluation of another resource
p124
aVWe show not only that this improves the reliability of human judgments, but also that it gives a framework where this relevance can be predicted automatically

p130
aVSmote synthetizes and adds new instances similar to the minority class instances and is more efficient than a mere resampling

aVThey still use u'\u005cu201c' essential u'\u005cu201d' evaluation measures (mostly synonym extraction), although the latter comes close to our work since it also trains a model to detect (intrinsically) bad neighbours by using example sentences with the words to discriminate
