<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We develop a skeleton-based model which divides translation into two sub-models a skeleton translation model (i.e.,, translating the key elements) and a full translation model (i.e.,, translating the remaining source words and generating the complete translation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>where the skeleton translation model handles the translation of the sentence skeleton, while the full translation model is the baseline model and handles the original problem of translating the whole sentence</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The skeleton translation model focuses on the translation of the sentence skeleton, i.e.,, the solid (red) rectangles; while the full translation model computes the model score for all those phrase-pairs, i.e.,, all solid and dashed rectangles</a>
