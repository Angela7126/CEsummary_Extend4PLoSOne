<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We see that the language model baseline for English u'\u2192' French shows the same substantial improvement over the baseline as our English u'\u2192' Spanish results</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Third, we observe that adding the language model to our classifier leads to another significant gain (configuration l1r1 + LM in the results in Table 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As expected, the LM baseline substantially outperforms the context-insensitive MLF baseline</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This intuitively makes sense; a context of one may seem to be better than any other when uniformly applied to all classifier experts, but it may well be that certain classifiers benefit from different feature selections</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The main research question in this research is how to disambiguate an L1 word or phrase to its L2 translation based on an L2 context, and whether such cross-lingual contextual approaches provide added value compared to baseline models that are not context informed or compared to standard language models</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Per classifier expert, the best scoring configuration was selected, referred to as the auto configuration in Table 2</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, if we enable the language model as we do in the auto + LM configuration we do not notice an improvement over l1r1 + LM , surprisingly</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In other words, for each word type or phrase type that occurs as a fragment in the training set, and which does not map to just a single translation, a classifier is trained</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We therefore conducted a number of experiments with other language pairs, and present the abridged results in Table 6</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A second baseline was constructed by weighing the probabilities from the translation table directly with the L2 language model described earlier</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The auto configuration improves results over the uniformly applied feature selection</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The language model is a trigram-based back-off language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing, computed using SRILM [] and trained on the same training data as the translation model</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Our full system, including the scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation, is implemented in Python and freely available as open-source from http://github.com/proycon/colibrita/</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>When presented with test data, in which the L1 fragment is explicitly marked, we first check whether there is ambiguity for this L1 fragment and if a direct translation is available in our simple mapping table</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In order to draw accurate conclusions, experiments on a single data set and language pair are not sufficient</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If not, we check for the presence of a classifier expert for the offered L1 fragment; only then we can proceed by extracting the desired number of L2 local context words to the immediate left and right of this fragment and adding those to the feature vector</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The baseline selects the most probable L1 fragment per L2 fragment according to the phrase-translation table</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Words or phrases that always map to a single translation are stored in a simple mapping table,</a>
