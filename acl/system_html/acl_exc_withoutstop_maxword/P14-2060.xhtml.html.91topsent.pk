VWe also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores
p1
aVThus multiple bin features can be active for a given candidate expansion of the abbreviation
p2
aVThen a small amount of annotated data is used to build models to determine whether to accept a candidate expansion of an abbreviation based on these features
p3
aVWe then take the Bayesian fusion of this model with the pair LM, by adding them in the log space, to get prediction from both the context and abbreviation model
p4
aVWe also have features that fire for each type of contextual
