<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For example, if we train the classifier using words as features, with values representing their frequency relative to the length of the document, the features corresponding to the word China might receive the following weights</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is no doubt that the toponymic terms are useful for increasing the NLI accuracy; however, from the psycho-linguistic perspective, we are more interested in what characteristics of L1 show up in L2 texts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The remaining bigrams indicate function words, toponymic terms like Germany , and frequent content words like take and new</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the fact that the two bigrams are also on the list for the I2 set, which does not include these languages, suggests that their importance is mostly due to the function words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results of this experiment are reported in the Indicative Bigrams column of Table 2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We replicate the experiments of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) by limiting the features to the 200 most frequent character bigrams</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Using Algorithm 2 , we identify the top 20 character bigrams, and replace them with randomly selected bigrams</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We conclude that character bigrams are effective in determining L1 of the author because they reflect differences in L2 word usage that are unrelated to the phonology of L1</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the hypothesis of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) was true, this should not be the case, as the phonology of L1 would influence the choice of words across</a>
