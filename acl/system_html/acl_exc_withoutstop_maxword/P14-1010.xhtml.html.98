<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Finally, we take the closure of this transducer, so that the resulting machine can transduce any sequence of words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Fortunately, LM annotation as well as any necessary lattice modifications can be performed simultaneously by composing the desegmented lattice with a finite state acceptor encoding the LM [ 26 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As Morfessor does not perform any orthographic normalizations, it can be desegmented with simple concatenation</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The lattice (Figure 1 a) can then be desegmented by composing it with the transducer ( 1 b), producing a desegmented lattice ( 1 c</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Table 4 breaks down per-phrase accuracy according to four manually-assigned categories</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The first feature indicates that the desegmented morphemes were translated from contiguous source words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A valid chain is complete if its edges form an entire word, and if it is part of a path through the lattice that consists only of words</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT</a>
