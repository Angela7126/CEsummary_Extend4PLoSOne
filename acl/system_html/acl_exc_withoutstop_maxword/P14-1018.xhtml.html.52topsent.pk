VSharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u005cu2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest
p1
aV[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features
p2
aVSuch extreme divergences in the amount of time required for classification across all graphs should be of strong interest to researchers concerned with latent attribute prediction tasks because Twitter users produce messages with extremely different frequencies
p3
aVFigure 3 demonstrates that more tweets during prediction time lead to higher accuracy by showing that more users with 100 tweets are correctly classified e.g.,, filled green markers in the right upper quadrant are true Republicans and in the left lower quadrant are true Democrats
p4
aVIn addition, we propose streaming models for personal analytics that dynamically update user labels based on their stream of communications which has been addressed previously by Van Durme ( 2012b
p5
aVOther methods characterize Twitter users by applying limited amounts of network structure information in addition to lexical features
p6
aVThese results follow naturally from the underlying feature representation having more tweets per user leads to a lower variance estimate of a target multinomial distribution
p7
aVWe rely on straightforward Bayesian rule update to our batch models in order to simulate a real-time streaming prediction scenario as a first step beyond the existing models as shown in Figure 2
p8
aVFor each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles
p9
aVWe represent p u'\u005cu039c' ( R u'\u005cu2223' T ) as a box and whisker plot with the median, lower and upper quantiles to show the variance; the length of whiskers indicate lower and upper extreme values
p10
aVHowever, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10
p11
aVWe prefer binary to normalized count-based features to overcome sparsity issues caused by making predictions on each tweet individually
p12
aVWe labeled users as Democratic if they exclusively follow both Democratic candidates 4 4 As of
