<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On the u'\u201d' hard u'\u201d' dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Noisy channel and iterative methods u'\u2019' frontiers are considerably inferior to the proposed method on u'\u201d' hard u'\u201d' dataset, which means that our method works better</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We tested all three methods on the u'\u201d' common u'\u201d' dataset</a>
