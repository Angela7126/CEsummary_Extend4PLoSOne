<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>ConnotationWordNet is expected to be the superset of a sentiment lexicon, as it is highly likely for any word with positive/negative sentiment to carry connotation of the same polarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, to show the utility of the resulting lexicon in the context of a concrete sentiment analysis task, we perform lexicon-based sentiment analysis</a>
