<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to produce a solution to this subproblem, we use an LP relaxation of the relevant portion of the ILP from Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) by omitting integer constraints over the token and dependency variables in u'\ud835' u'\udc31' and u'\ud835' u'\udc33' respectively</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This approach requires O u'\u2062' ( n 2 u'\u2062' R ) time in order to identify the highest scoring sequence u'\ud835' u'\udc32' and corresponding</a>
