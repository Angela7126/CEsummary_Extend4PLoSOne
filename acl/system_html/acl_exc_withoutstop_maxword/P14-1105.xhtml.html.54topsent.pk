VBecause our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as u'\u005cu201c' neutral u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' biased u'\u005cu201d' , we filter the dataset further using dualist [ 23 ] , an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences in our dataset

aVTo train the dualist classifier, we manually assigned class labels of u'\u005cu201c' neutral u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' biased u'\u005cu201d' to 200 sentences, and selected typical partisan unigrams to represent the u'\u005cu201c' biased u'\u005cu201d' class dualist labels 11,555 sentences as politically biased, 5,434 of which come from conservative authors and 6,121 of which come from liberal authors
