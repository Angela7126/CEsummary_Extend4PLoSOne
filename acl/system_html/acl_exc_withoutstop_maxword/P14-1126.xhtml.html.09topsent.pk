VOur approach training on only parallel data without unlabeled data for the target language
p1
aVOur approach training on both parallel and unlabeled data
p2
aVIn addition to their original results, we also report results by re-implementing the direct transfer parser based on the first-order projective dependency parsing model [ 30 ] (DTP u'\u005cu2020'
p3
aVHowever, in our scenario we have no labeled training data for target languages but we have some parallel and unlabeled data plus an English dependency parser
p4
aVWe report both the results of the direct transfer and projected transfer parsers directly cited from McDonald et al
p5
aVCentral to our approach is a maximizing likelihood learning framework, in which we use an English parser and parallel text to estimate the u'\u005cu201c' transferring distribution u'\u005cu201d' of the target language parsing model
