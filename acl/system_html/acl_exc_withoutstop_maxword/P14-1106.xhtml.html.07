<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board</a>
