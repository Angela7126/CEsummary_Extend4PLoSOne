VBy inspecting the parser outputs, we found that error propagation caused by assigning incorrect head to punctuations is one of the main reason that leads to this result
p1
aVSince long sentences are inherently more difficult to parse, to make a fair comparison, we further divide the development set according to sentence lengths as shown in the first row 4 4 1694 out of 1700 sentences on the development set with length no larger than 60 tokens
p2
aVAs for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with no
