<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, for effectively classifying a given user v i it is better to take 200 tweets each from 10 neighbors rather than 2,000 tweets from the user</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Similar to our work, they assume that users from a particular class tend to reply and retweet messages of the users from the same class</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>[ 30 ] suggest a hierarchical Bayesian model which takes advantage of user name morphology for predicting user gender and ethnicity</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Next we propose to extend the baseline model by taking advantage of language in user social circles as describe below</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The more robustly this distribution is estimated (based on having more tweets) the more confident we should be in the classifier output</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>[ 15 ] propose a bilinear user-centric model for predicting voting intentions in the UK and Australia from social media data</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We show that three of six social circles u'\u2013' friend, retweet and user-mention yield better accuracy compared to the user model for all graphs when t u'\u2265' 250</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We labeled users as Democratic if they exclusively follow both Democratic candidates 4 4 As of Oct 12, 2012, the number of followers for Obama, Biden, Romney and Ryan were 2m, 168k, 1.3m and 267k u'\u2013' BarackObama and JoeBiden but do not follow both Republican candidates u'\u2013' MittRomney and RepPaulRyan and vice versa</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We demonstrate that increasing the size of the neighborhood leads to better performance across six neighborhood types</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The proposed baseline model follows the same trends as the existing state-of-the-art approaches for user attribute classification in social media as described in Section 8</a>
