<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We classify 7 as typos and 26 as annotation inconsistencies, although the distinction between the two is murky typos are intentionally preserved in the treebank data, but segmentation of typos varies depending on how well they can be reconciled with standard Arabic orthography</a>
