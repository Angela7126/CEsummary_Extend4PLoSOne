<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Scopal information in MRS analyses delivered by the ERG fixes the scope of operators u'\u2014' such as negation, modals, scopal adverbs (including subordinating conjunctions like while ), and clause-embedding verbs (e.g., believe ) u'\u2014' based on their position in the constituent structure, while leaving the scope of quantifiers (e.g., a or every , but also other determiners) free</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>From these underspecified representations of possible scopal configurations, a scope resolution component can spell out the full range of fully-connected logical forms [ 4 ] , but it turns out that such enumeration is not relevant here the notion of scope encoded in the Shared Task annotations is not concerned with the relative scope of quantifiers and negation, such as the two possible readings of ( 3 ) represented informally below</a>
