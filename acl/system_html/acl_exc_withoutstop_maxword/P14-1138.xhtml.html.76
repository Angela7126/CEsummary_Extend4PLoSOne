<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the lookup layer, each of these words is converted to its word embedding, and then the concatenation of the two embeddings ( x j ) is fed to the hidden layer in the same manner as the FFNN-based model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As an instance of discriminative models, we describe an FFNN-based word alignment model [ 40 ] , which is our baseline</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The alignment model based on an FFNN is formed in the same manner as the lexical translation model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the FFNN-based model, we set the word embedding length M to 30, the number of units of a hidden layer z 1 to 100, and the window size of contexts to 5</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that alignments in the FFNN-based model are also governed by first-order Markov dynamics because an alignment score depends on the previous alignment a j - 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The RNN-based model can be trained by a supervised approach, similar to the FFNN-based model, where training proceeds based on the ranking loss defined by Eq</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, the proposed model can find alignments by taking advantage of the long alignment history, while the FFNN-based model considers only the last alignment</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Viterbi alignment is determined using the Viterbi algorithm, similar</a>
