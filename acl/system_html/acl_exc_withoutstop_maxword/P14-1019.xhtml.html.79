<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When proposing a small move, i.e.,, sampling a head of the word, we can also jointly sample its POS tag from a set of alternatives provided by the tagger</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features</a>
