VThe max-violation method performs the update where the model score difference between the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and the best y -good partial derivation is maximal, by penalizing the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and rewarding the y -good partial derivation
p1
aVNote that the y -good derivations are defined over the unpruned whole decoding hypergraph, while the y -bad derivations are defined over the real decoding hypergraph with pruning
p2
aVIn other words, the gold derivation to update towards is a latent variable
p3
aVMore formally, we first find the Viterbi partial derivation d - and the best y -good partial derivation d
