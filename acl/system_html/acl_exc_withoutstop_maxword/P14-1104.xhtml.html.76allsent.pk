VWe employ Amazon u'\u005cu2019' s Mechanical Turk (AMT) to label the emotions of Twitter data, and apply the proposed methods to the AMT dataset with the goals of improving the annotation quality at low cost, as well as learning accurate emotion classifiers
p1
aVSpecifically, according to Formula ( 3 ), a high (absolute value of) spread score indicates that the Delta IDF score of that term on that class is high and deviates greatly from the scores on other classes
p2
aV1) accurately predicting the labels of data points and ranking them based on prediction confidence, so that the most likely errors can be effectively identified; (2) requiring less time on training, so that the saved time can be spent on correcting more labeling errors
p3
aVDelta IDF boosts the importance of terms that tend to be class-specific in the dataset, since they are usually effective features in distinguishing one class from another
p4
aVFollowing this idea, we develop computationally cheap feature weighting techniques to counteract such effect by boosting the weight of discriminative features, so that they would not be subdued and the instances with such features would have higher chance to be correctly classified
p5
aVWith the proposed algorithm, the active learner becomes more accurate and resistant to label noise, thus the mislabeled data points can be more easily and accurately identified
p6
aVNoise tolerance techniques aim to improve the learning algorithm itself to avoid over-fitting caused by mislabeled instances in the training phase, so that the constructed classifier becomes more noise-tolerant
p7
aVOne possible reason is that some effective features that should be given high weights are inhibited in the training phase due to the labeling errors
p8
aVWhile these feature weighting models can be used to score and rank instances for data cleaning, better classification and regression models can be built by using the feature weights generated by these models as a pre-weight on the data points for other machine learning algorithms
p9
aVFor any term t j u'\u005cu2208' V , we can get its Delta IDF score on a class l
p10
aVThe idea is that some effective features may be subdued due to label noise, and the proposed techniques are capable of counteracting such effect, so that the performance of classification algorithms could be less affected by the noise
p11
aVThe mechanism of Formula ( 3 ) is to non-linearly spread out the distribution, so that the importance of class-specific features can be further boosted to counteract the effect of noisy labels
p12
aVOne widely used approach [ 1 , 22 ] is to create an ensemble classifier that combines the outputs of multiple classifiers by either majority vote or consensus, and an instance is tagged as mislabeled and removed from the training set if it is classified into a different class than its training label by the ensemble classifier
p13
aVDifferent from the commonly used TF (term frequency) or TF.IDF (term frequency.inverse document frequency) weighting schemes, Delta IDF treats the positive and negative training instances as two separate corpora, and weighs the terms by how biased they are to one corpus
p14
aVSpecifically, we propose a novel non-linear distribution spreading algorithm, which first uses Delta IDF technique [ 11 ] to weight features, and then leverages the distribution of Delta IDF scores of a feature across different classes to efficiently recognize discriminative features for the classification task in the presence of mislabeled data
p15
aVActive learning for data cleaning differs from traditional active learning because the data already has low quality labels
p16
aVFor example, useful information can be removed with noise elimination, since annotation errors are likely to occur on ambiguous instances that are potentially valuable for learning algorithms
p17
aVAverage Precision (AP) is the average of the algorithm u'\u005cu2019' s precision at every position in the confidence ranked list of results where a true emotional document has been identified
p18
aVThe imbalanced class distribution aggravates the confirmation bias u'\u005cu2013' the minority class examples are especially easy to miss when labeling quickly due to their rare presence in the dataset
p19
aVThe model u'\u005cu2019' s ability to discriminate at the feature level can be further enhanced by leveraging the distribution of feature weights across multiple classes, e.g.,, multiple emotion categories funny , happy , sad , exciting , boring , etc
p20
aVFor example, emoticon u'\u005cu201c' :D u'\u005cu201d' is a good indicator for emotion happy , however, if by mistake many instances containing this emoticon are not correctly labeled as happy , this class-specific feature would be underestimated during training
p21
aVFor a class u , we calculate the spreading score s u'\u005cu2062' p u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' d j u of each feature t j u'\u005cu2208' V using a non-linear distribution spreading formula as following (where s is the configurable spread parameter
p22
aVThe top m instances with the highest probabilities belonging to some class but conflicting preliminary labels are selected as the most likely errors for annotators to fix
p23
aVThe problem is to obtain a high-quality dataset D by fixing labeling errors in D ^ , and learn an accurate classifier C from it
p24
aVSince we focus on n-gram features, we use the words feature and term interchangeably in this paper
p25
aVUsing Formula ( 1 ) and dataset D l ^ , we get the Delta IDF weight vector for each class l u'\u005cu0394' l = ( u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f 1 l , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f
p26
aVWe partition T into k subsets, and each time we keep a different subset as testing data and train a classifier using the other k - 1 subsets of data
p27
aVEach training instance (e.g.,, a document) is represented as a feature vector x i = ( w 1 , i , u'\u005cu2026' , w
p28
aVThus we aim to build a classifier that is both accurate and time efficient
p29
aVThis algorithm first utilizes Delta IDF to weigh the features, and then non-linearly spreads out the distribution of features u'\u005cu2019' Delta IDF scores to exaggerate the weight of discriminative features
p30
aVThis AMT annotated dataset was used as the low quality dataset D ^ in our evaluation
p31
aVIn addition, when the noise ratio is high, there may not be adequate amount of data remaining for building an accurate classifier
p32
aVNote that some tweets were discarded as mixed examples for each emotion based upon thresholds for how many times they were tagged, and it resulted in different number of tweets in each emotion dataset
p33
aVAn intuitive idea is to design algorithms that classify the data points and rank them according to the decreasing confidence scores of their labels
p34
aVUnlike the work in [ 15 ] , this paper focuses on developing algorithms that can enhance the ability of active learner on identifying labeling errors, which we consider as a key challenge of this approach but ALC has not addressed
p35
aVA large number of studies have explored noise elimination techniques [ 1 , 22 , 25 , 13 , 5 ] , which identifies and removes mislabeled examples from the dataset as a pre-processing step before building classifiers
p36
aVDue to these reasons, there is a lack of sufficient and high quality labeled data for emotion research
p37
aVGenerally, Figure 3 shows consistent performance gains as more labels are corrected during active learning
p38
aVAfter that, the same dataset was annotated independently by a group of expert annotators to create the ground truth
p39
aVThe distribution of Delta IDF scores of t j on all classes in L is represented as u'\u005cu0394' j = { u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f j 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f j
p40
aVwhere t u'\u005cu2062' f j , i is the number of times term t j occurs in document x i , and u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f j is the Delta IDF score of t j
p41
aVSince in real world applications people are primarily concerned with how well the algorithm will work for new TV shows or movies that may not be included in the training data, we defined a test fold for each TV show or movie in our labeled data set
p42
aVSince the dataset is highly imbalanced, we applied the under-sampling strategy when training the classifiers
p43
aVWe conduct experiments on a Twitter dataset that contains tweets about TV shows and movies
p44
aVDelta IDF technique boosts the weight of features with strong discriminative power
p45
aVFor the experimental purpose, the re-annotation was done by assigning the ground truth labels to the selected instances
p46
aVBased on the dot product or SVM regression scores, we ranked the tweets by how strongly they express the emotion
p47
aVExtensive experiments show that, the proposed techniques are as effective as more computational expensive techniques (e.g, Support Vector Machines) but require significantly less time for training/running, which makes it well-suited for active learning
p48
aVZeng and Martinez (2001) present an approach based on backpropagation neural networks to automatically correct the mislabeled data
p49
aVDuring the re-annotation process we keep the old labels hidden to prevent that information from biasing annotators u'\u005cu2019' decisions
p50
aVThe algorithm should be computationally cheap as well as accurate, so it fits well with active learning and other problems that require frequent iterations on large datasets
p51
aVSpecifically, we propose a non-linear distribution spreading algorithm for feature weighting
p52
aVVannoorenberghe and Denoeux (2002) propose a method based on belief decision trees to handle uncertain labels in the training set
p53
aVWe consider emotion analysis as an interesting and challenging problem domain of this study, and conduct comprehensive experiments on Twitter data
p54
aVIt demonstrates the challenge of annotation by crowdsourcing
p55
aVAccording to the figure, SVM-Delta-IDF and SVM-TF are the most advantageous methods, followed by Spread and Delta-IDF
p56
aVFor each instance, we can calculate the TF.Delta-IDF score as its weight
p57
aVSee Table 1 for the statistics of the annotations collected from AMT
p58
aVWhen the dataset is imblanced, to avoid building a biased model, we down sample the majority class before calculating the Delta IDF score and then use the a bias balancing procedure to balance the Delta IDF weight vector
p59
aVThis process is repeated k times so that we get a classifier for each of the k subsets
p60
aVAs minority classes, emotional tweets can be easily missed because the last X tweets are all not emotional, and the annotators do not expect the next one to be either
p61
aV2) Emotion expressions could be subtle and ambiguous and thus are easy to miss when labeling quickly
p62
aVIn other words, our algorithm assigns high spread score (absolute value) to a term on a class for which the term has strong discriminative power and very specific to that class compared with to other classes
p63
aVThus, AP places extra emphasis on getting the front of the list correct
p64
aVHowever, because annotators that are recruited this way may lack expertise and motivation, the annotations tend to be more noisy and unreliable, which significantly reduces the performance of the classification model
p65
aVMingers (1989) explores pruning methods for identifying and removing unreliable branches from a decision tree to reduce the influence of noise
p66
aVThe latter option is appealing since it creates a large annotated dataset at low cost
p67
aV2011) and they further demonstrate that its performance can be significantly improved by utilizing unlabeled data
p68
aVTakes the dot product of the Delta IDF weight vector (Formula 1 ) with the document u'\u005cu2019' s term frequency vector
p69
aVThis procedure first divides the Delta IDF weight vector to two vectors, one of which contains all the features with positive scores, and the other of which contains all the features with negative scores
p70
aVThe distinction of multiple classes can be used to further force feature bias scores apart to improve the identification of class-specific features in the presence of labeling errors
p71
aVTakes the dot product of the distribution spread weight vector (Formula 3 ) with the document u'\u005cu2019' s term frequency vector
p72
aVLabeling noise affects the classification accuracy
p73
aVWe first introduce Delta-IDF technique, and then describe our algorithm of distribution spreading
p74
aVThe basic idea of active learning is to learn an accurate classifier using less training data
p75
aVBuilding the classifier C that allows the most likely mislabeled instances to be selected and annotated is the essence of the active learning approach
p76
aVThe more biased a term is to one class, the higher (absolute value of) weight it will get
p77
aVV is the weight of term t j in instance x i
p78
aVWhen the dataset is imbalanced, we apply the similar bias balancing procedure as described in Section 4.1 to the spreading model
p79
aVKalaia and Servediob (2005) present a boosting algorithm which can achieve arbitrarily high accuracy in the presence of data noise
p80
aVOne measure of improvement for annotation quality is the number of mislabeled instances that can be fixed after a certain number of active learning iterations
p81
aVThe data points with the highest confidence scores but conflicting preliminary labels are most likely mislabeled
p82
aVUses a bag of words SVM classification with TF.Delta-IDF weights (Formula 2 ) in the feature vectors before training or testing an SVM
p83
aVIn this work, we borrow the idea of active learning to interactively and iteratively correct labeling errors
p84
aVWe selected the top m tweets with the highest dot product or regression scores but conflicting preliminary AMT labels as the suspected mislabeled instances for re-annotation, just as described in Algorithm 3
p85
aVAn active learner uses a small set of labeled data to iteratively select the most informative instances from a large pool of unlabeled data for human annotators to label [ 17 ]
p86
aVIn each iteration, the algorithm trains classifiers using the training data in T
p87
aVAlgorithm 3 illustrates an active learning approach to the problem
p88
aVUses a bag of words SVM with term frequency weights
p89
aVwhere P (or N ) is the number of positively (or negatively) labeled training instances, P j (or N j ) is the number of positively (or negatively) labeled training instances with term t j
p90
aVInstead of eliminating the mislabeled examples from training data, some researchers [ 24 , 15 , 10 ] propose to correct labeling errors either with or without consulting human experts
p91
aVWe evaluate the proposed approach on two factors, the effectiveness of the models for emotion classification, and the improvement of annotation quality provided by the active learning procedure
p92
aVWe calculate the Delta IDF score of every term in V , and get the Delta IDF weight vector u'\u005cu0394' = ( u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f
p93
aVWhen applying a classifier to classify the instances in the corresponding data subset, we get the probability about how likely one instance belongs to a class
p94
aVThere are two main goals of developing this classifier
p95
aVD ^ contains an unknown number of mislabeled data points
p96
aVSimple add-one smoothing is used to smooth low frequency terms and prevent dividing by zero when a term appears in only one corpus
p97
aVDelta IDF [ 11 ] assigns score u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' _ u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' f j to term t j in V as
p98
aVThe process of selecting and re-labeling data points can be conducted with multiple rounds to iteratively improve the data quality
p99
aV2012) propose an algorithm which first trains individual SVM classifiers on several small, class-balanced, random subsets of the dataset, and then reclassifies each training instance using a majority vote of these individual classifiers
p100
aVIn order to evaluate our approach in real world scenarios, instead of creating a high quality annotated dataset and then introducing artificial noise, we followed the common practice of crowdsoucing, and collected emotion annotations through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT
p101
aVV is the number of unique terms in V
p102
aVKarmaker and Kwek (2006) propose a modified AdaBoost algorithm u'\u005cu2013' ORBoost, which minimizes the impact of outliers and becomes more tolerant to class label noise
p103
aVIn comparison, the average training time of a Spread classifier was only 21.4 seconds, and it required almost no parameter tuning
p104
aVWe used this annotated dataset as ground truth
p105
aVThis algorithm takes the noisy dataset D ^ as input
p106
aVThis is a challenge faced by many real world applications u'\u005cu2013' given a large, quickly and cheaply created, low quality annotated dataset, how can one improve its quality and learn an accurate classifier from it
p107
aVIt uses the difference between the low quality label for each data point and a prediction of the label using supervised machine learning models built upon the low quality labels
p108
aVAfter we obtained the annotated dataset from AMT, we posted the same dataset (without the labels) to a group of expert annotators
p109
aVOverall, at the end of the active learning process, Spread outperforms SVM-TF by 3.03% the MAP score (and by 4.29% the F1 score), and SVM-Delta-IDF outperforms SVM-TF by 8.59% the MAP score (and by 5.26% the F1 score
p110
aVIn many scenarios, it is worth the effort and cost to fix the labeling errors by human experts, in order to obtain a high quality dataset that can be reused by the community
p111
aVTwo noise identification schemes, majority and non-objection, are used to combine the decision from each set of rules to decide whether an instance is mislabeled
p112
aVIn Active Learning [ 17 ] a small set of labeled data is used to find documents that should be annotated from a large pool of unlabeled documents
p113
aV2012) propose a solution called Active Label Correction (ALC) which iteratively presents the experts with small sets of suspected mislabeled instances at each round
p114
aV2003) propose a partition-based approach, which constructs classification rules from each subset of the dataset, and then evaluates each instance using these rules
p115
aVRemoving mislabeled instances has been demonstrated to be effective in increasing the classification accuracy in prior studies, but there are also some major drawbacks
p116
aVOur work employs a similar framework that uses active learning for data cleaning
p117
aVOne of the main disadvantages of noise tolerance techniques is that they are learning algorithm-dependent

aVAmazon Mechanical Turk Annotation we posted the set of 100K tweets to the workers on AMT for emotion annotation
p121
aVThis is similar to the strategy of active learning

aVSupervised classification algorithms require annotated data to teach the machine, by example, how to perform a specific task
p125
aV2004) propose a different approach, which represents the proximity between instances in a geometrical neighborhood graph, and an instance is considered suspect if in its neighborhood the proportion of examples of the same class is not significantly greater than in the dataset itself

p150
aVSome researchers have studied harnessing Twitter hashtags to automatically create an emotion annotated dataset [ 23 ]
p151
aVHowever, the automatic correction may introduce new noise to the dataset by mistakenly changing a correct label to a wrong one

aVSpread and Delta-IDF are superior with respect to the time efficiency
p166
aVIn our experiments, on average, it took 258.8 seconds to train a SVM-TF classifier for one emotion
p167
aVBesides the four methods, we also implemented a random baseline (Random) which randomly selected the specified number of instances for re-annotation in each round
p168
aVWe defined a set of annotation guidelines, which specified rules and examples to help annotators determine when to tag a tweet with an emotion
p169
aVSpread achieves a F1 Score of 58.84%, which is quite competitive compared to 59.82% achieved by SVM-Delta-IDF, though SVM-Delta-IDF outperforms Spread with respect to MAP

p179
aVWe evaluated the results with both Mean Average Precision (MAP) and F1 Score
p180
aVFor further quality control, we also gathered additional annotations from additional workers for tweets where only one out of two workers identified an emotion

aVIn comparison, SVM-Delta-IDF significantly outperforms SVM-TF with respect to both MAP and F1 Score

aVFor all the experiments, we used spread parameter s = 2
p197
aVRe-annotating the whole dataset is too expensive
p198
aVThe other important quantity to measure is annotation quality
p199
aVWe evaluated the overall performance relative to the common SVM bag of words approach that can be ubiquitously found in text mining literature
p200
aVBetter methods can fix more labels with fewer iterations
p201
aVWe defined our own set of emotions to annotate
p202
aVThese tests include (1) identifying workers with poor pairwise agreement, (2) identifying workers with poor performance on English language annotation, (3) identifying workers that were annotating at unrealistic speeds, (4) identifying workers with near random annotation distributions, and (5) identifying workers that annotate each tweet for a given TV show the same (or nearly the same) way
p203
aVSpam tweets were filtered out using a set of heuristics and manually crafted rules
p204
aVEach tweet was annotated by at least two workers
p205
aVAfter the last iteration, SVM-Delta-IDF, SVM-TF, Spread and Delta-IDF has fixed 85.23%, 85.85%, 81.05% and 58.66% of the labels, respectively, all of which significantly outperform the Random baseline (29.74%
p206
aVHigh-quality annotations can be produced by expert annotators, but the process is usually slow and costly
p207
aVThe proposed approach does not suffer these limitations
p208
aVMany different strategies have been used to select the best points to annotate

p210
aVWhen there was a disagreement between two experts, they discussed to reach an agreement or gathered additional opinion from another expert to decide the label of a tweet
p211
aVWe used standard bag of unigram and bigram words representation and topic-based fold cross validation
p212
aVWe stop re-annotating on the I u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' h round after we decide that the reward for an additional round of annotation is too low to justify
p213
aVMuhlenbach et al
p214
aVIn practice, we apply k -fold cross-validation
p215
aVWe have also conducted experiments using Delta-IDF, but its performance is low and not comparable with the other three methods
p216
aVWe manually inspected any worker with low performance on any of these tests before we made a final decision about using any of their annotations
p217
aVIn this work, we annotate eight different emotions
p218
aVThis is highly desirable for many practical application such as intelligent search, recommendation, and target advertising where users almost never see results that are not at the top of the list
