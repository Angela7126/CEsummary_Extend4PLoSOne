VWe next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p1
aVThus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account
p2
aVThe Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predicates with the same syntactic properties were systematically related semantically
p3
aVThe consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames
p4
aVAs noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments
p5
aVThere are many sophisticated rubrics for calculating consistency
p6
aVEven a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames
p7
aVThe consistency for this class/frame combination is 60%
p8
aVPrevious work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs [ 10 ]
p9
aVMean consistency averaged across classes is shown for each task in Table 2
p10
aVIn Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2
p11
aVAs expected, consistency was lowest for Evaluation , which is not expected to necessarily correlate with
