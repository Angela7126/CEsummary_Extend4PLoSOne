VIt may initially seem surprising to have annotations of technical statements not done by domain experts; we did this intentionally because it is common to communicate unfamiliar topics to the public in political and science communication (we comment on non-expert rationales later
p1
aVFor pair 1, while one turker pointed out the decline in number of experiments, most turkers simply labeled it as stronger because it was more specific u'\u005cu201c' Specific u'\u005cu201d' turned out to be a common reason used in the comments, even though we said in the instructions that only additional justification and evidence matter
p2
aVThis could be because a single author enjoys greater freedom and has stronger motivation to make changes, or because multiple authors tend to submit a more polished initial version
p3
aV2 2 http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/u-n-security-council-condemns-terrorist-attack-in-kunming/ In particular, regarding the statement by the US embassy that referred to this incident as the u'\u005cu201c' terrible and senseless act of violence in Kunming u'\u005cu201d' , a Weibo user posted u'\u005cu201c' If you say that the Kunming attack is a u'\u005cu2018' terrible and senseless act of violence u'\u005cu2019' , then the 9/11 attack can be called a u'\u005cu2018' regrettable traffic incident u'\u005cu201d' u'\u005cu2019'
p4
aVThe main contribution of this work is to provide the first large-scale corpus of sentence-level revisions for studying a broad range of variations in statement strength
p5
aVBut the lack of edit histories or revisions makes them not immediately suitable for studying strength differences
p6
aVIn order to align the first version and the final version of the same paper, we first did macro alignment of paper sections based on section titles
p7
aVSince the arXiv started in 1991, it has become u'\u005cu201c' the standard repository for new papers in mathematics, physics, statistics, computer science, biology, and other disciplines u'\u005cu201d' []
p8
aVTo create the pool of pairs for labeling, we randomly sampled 1000 pairs and then removed pairs that we thought were processing errors
p9
aVSince the strength and scope of an argument can be a crucial factor in its success, it is important to understand the effects of statement strength in communication
p10
aVBut it is clear that the majority of changes are rewrites; thus revisions on the arXiv indeed provide a great source for potential strength differences
p11
aVOne might initially think that typo fixes represent a large proportion of revisions, but this is not correct, as shown in Figure 4
p12
aVMany differences between these versions constitute a source of valid and motivated strength differences, as can be seen from the sentential revisions in Table 1
p13
aV1 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack In the aftermath, Chinese media accused Western media of u'\u005cu201c' soft-pedaling the attack and failing to state clearly that it was an act of terrorism u'\u005cu201d'
p14
aVParticipants were then asked to choose labels and write mandatory comments for 50 pairs
p15
aVDeletions represent a substantial fraction, especially in the middle section of a paper
p16
aVSince it is likely that a new version adds or deletes a large sequence of sentences, we did not impose a skip penalty
p17
aV10 10 These decisions were made based on the results and feedback that we got from graduate students in an initial labeling
p18
aVThe instructions included 8 pairs as examples and 10 pairs to label as a training exercise
p19
aVA first step towards addressing this question is to be able to distinguish between strong and weak statements
p20
aVAs strength is inherently relative, it is natural to look at revisions that change statement strength, which we refer to as u'\u005cu201c' strength changes u'\u005cu201d'
p21
aVInstead of cosine similarity, we used an idf-weighted longest-common-subsequence algorithm to define the similarity between two sentences, because changes in word ordering can also be interesting
p22
aVThese datasets are useful for understanding the progress of disciplines or the evolution of topics
p23
aVBut in S2 for that pair, the result holds for strictly fewer possible worlds
p24
aVPair 1 makes the contribution seem more impressive by replacing u'\u005cu201c' studied u'\u005cu201d' with u'\u005cu201c' proposed u'\u005cu201d'
p25
aVPublic datasets of science communication are available, such as the ACL Anthology, 5 5 http://aclweb.org/anthology/ collections of NIPS papers, 6 6 http://nips.djvuzone.org/txt.html and so on
p26
aVFor instance, the majority labeled pair 2 as u'\u005cu201c' stronger u'\u005cu201d'
p27
aV9 9 This differs from the number in Section 1 because articles may not have the tex source available, or the differences between versions may be in non-textual content
p28
aVFirst, participants tend to take details as evidence even when these details are not germane to the statement
p29
aVAccording to the comments written by participants, we believe that they did the labeling in good faith
p30
aVThe comments indicate features that humans think salient
p31
aV8 8 We did not allow cross matching (i.e.,, i u'\u005cu2192' j - 1 , i - 1 u'\u005cu2192' j ), since we thought matching this case as ( i - 1 , i ) u'\u005cu2192' j or i u'\u005cu2192' ( j , j - 1 ) can provide context for annotation purposes
