<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings is denoted as u'\ud835' u'\udc9f' u'\u2032' = { ( u'\ud835' u'\udc2e' i , u'\ud835' u'\udcb1' i ) } i = 1 M , where u'\ud835' u'\udc2e' i is an unlabeled sentence, and u'\ud835' u'\udcb1' i is the corresponding parse forest</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The second major row shows the results when we use single 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Results show all the three sets of unlabeled data can help the parser</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We propose a generalized ambiguity-aware ensemble training framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing, which can make better use of unlabeled data, especially when parsers from different views produce divergent syntactic structures</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using unlabeled data with the results of Berkeley Parser ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B u'\u201d' ) significantly improves parsing accuracy by 0.55% (93.40-92.85) on English and 1.06% (83.34-82.28) on Chinese</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar</a>
