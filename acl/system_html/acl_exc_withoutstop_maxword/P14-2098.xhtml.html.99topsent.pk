VFirst, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced
p1
aVOur analysis confirms that the merging step is the bottleneck in the current correction detection system u'\u005cu2013' it accounts for 75% of the mis-detections
p2
aVWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence
p3
aVComparing a student-written sentence with its revision, we observe that each correction can be decomposed into a set of more basic edits
