<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For source language, this is relatively straightforward, as the intermediate representation can be directly tuned for the problem in question using labeled training data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The shared feature representation for direct transfer is derived from u'\u03a9' 0 by replacing language-specific part-of-speech tags with universal ones [] and adding cross-lingual word clusters [] to word types</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In English-Czech and Czech-English we also use the dependency relation information, since the annotations are partly compatible</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also believe that FRP may profit from using</a>
