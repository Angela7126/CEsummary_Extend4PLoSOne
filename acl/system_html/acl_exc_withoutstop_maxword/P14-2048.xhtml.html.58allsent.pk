VAfter translating the sentences, we take 20,000 sentences from each engine output and conduct the detection experiment by labeling those sentences as MT sentences, and another 20,000 sentences, which are the human reference translations, labeled as reference sentences
p1
aVFor data, we use 20,000 random, non reference sentences from the Hansard corpus, against 20,000 sentences from one MT system per experiment, again resulting in 40,000 sentence instances per experiment
p2
aVWe first use 3000 reference sentences from the WMT13 u'\u005cu2019' English reference translations, against the matching 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment
p3
aVIn the second experiment, we use 3000 random, non reference sentences from the newstest 2011-2012 corpora published in WMT12 u'\u005cu2019' [] against 3000 output sentences from one MT system at a time, again resulting in 6000 sentence instances per experiment
p4
aVUsing simple linear regression, we also obtain an R 2 value (coefficient of determination) over the measurements of detection accuracy and BLEU score, for each of three feature set combinations (function words, POS tags and mixed) and the two data combinations (MT vs reference and MT vs non reference sentences
p5
aVAs can be seen in the above experiments, there is a strong correlation between the BLEU score and the MT detection accuracy of our method
p6
aVWhile applying the same classification method as with the reference sentences, the detection accuracy rises, while the correlation with the translation quality yields R 2 = 0.556 , as can be seen in Figure 4
p7
aVIn Figure 1 , we show the relationship of the observed detection accuracy for each system with the BLEU score of that system
p8
aVSpecifically, given a corpus consisting of both machine-translated English text (English being the target language) and native English text (not necessarily the reference translation of the machine-translated text), we measure the accuracy of the system in classifying the sentences in the corpus as machine-translated or not
p9
aVWhile Arase and Zhou [] considered MT detection at sentence level, as we do in this paper, they did not study the correlation between the translation quality of the machine translated text and the ability to detect it
p10
aVArase and Zhou [] trained a sentence-level classifier to distinguish machine translated text from human generated text on English and Japanese web-page corpora, translated by Google Translate, Bing and an in-house SMT system
p11
aVThis accuracy will be shown to decrease as the quality of the underlying MT system increases
p12
aVIn the third section, we describe experiments regarding the detection of machine translation and in the fourth section we discuss the use of detection techniques as a machine translation quality estimation method
p13
aVIn fact, the correlation is strong enough that we propose that this accuracy measure itself can be used as a measure of MT system quality, obviating the need for a reference corpus, as for example is necessary for BLEU []
p14
aVWe conduct the same classification experiment as above, with features based on function words and POS tags, and SMO-based SVM as the classifier
p15
aVFurthermore, additional features and feature selection techniques can be applied, both for improving detection accuracy and for strengthening the correlation with human quality estimation
p16
aVAs is evident, regardless of the feature set or non-MT sentences used, the correlation between detection accuracy and BLEU score is very high, as we can also see from the R 2 values in Table 1
p17
aVFurther work might include applying our methods to other language pairs and domains, acquiring word-level quality estimation or integrating our method in a machine translation system
p18
aVThis suggests that our method might be used as an unsupervised quality estimation method when no reference sentences are available, such as for resource-poor source languages
p19
aVFor purposes of classification, we use the same content independent features as in the previous experiment, based on function words and POS tags, again with SMO-based SVM as the classifier
p20
aVRegarding the detection of machine translated text, Carter and Inkpen [] translated the Hansards of the 36th Parliament of Canada using the Microsoft Bing MT web service, and conducted three detection experiments at document level, using unigrams, average token length, and type-token ratio as features
p21
aVSeveral works [] used text classification techniques in order to distinguish human translated text from native language text at document or paragraph level, using features like word and POS n-grams, proportion of grammatical words in the text, nouns, finite verbs, auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs, numerals, pronouns, prepositions, determiners, conjunctions etc
p22
aVAs can be seen in Figure 3 , the detection accuracy is strongly correlated with the evaluations scores, yielding R 2 = 0.774
p23
aVProminent among these are how to evaluate the quality of such a system efficiently and how to detect the output of such systems (for example, to avoid using it circularly as input for refining MT systems
p24
aVIt can also be seen that, as might be expected, it is easier to distinguish machine-translated sentences from a non-reference set than from the reference set
p25
aVIn order to do so, we use the Moses statistical machine translation toolkit []
p26
aVUsing these features alone, without the FW and POS tag based features presented above, we obtain an R 2 = 0.829 with a proportion of identically ordered pairs at 0.923 (72 of 78), as shown in Figure 5
p27
aVDue to the sparseness of the data at the sentence level, we use common content-independent linguistic features for the classification task
p28
aVUsing automatic text classification methods in the field of translation studies had many use cases in recent years, mainly as an empirical method of measuring, proving or contradicting translation universals
p29
aVWe consider only those entries that appear at least ten times in the entire corpus, in order to reduce sparsity in the data
p30
aVAs our learning algorithm we use SVM with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), taken from the WEKA machine learning toolkit []
p31
aVAgain, we represent each sentence as a boolean vector, in which each entry represents the presence or absence of the CFG rule in the parse-tree of the sentence
p32
aVTo verify this intuition, we create parse trees using the Berkeley parser [] and extract the one-level CFG rules as features
