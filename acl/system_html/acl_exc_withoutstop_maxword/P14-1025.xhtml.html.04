<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There has been a considerable amount of research on representing word senses and disambiguating usages of words in context ( wsd ) as, in order to produce computational systems that understand and produce natural language, it is essential to have a means of representing and disambiguating word sense wsd algorithms require word sense information to disambiguate token instances of a given ambiguous word, e.g., in the form of sense definitions [] , semantic relationships [ 17 ] or annotated data [ 20 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory</a>
