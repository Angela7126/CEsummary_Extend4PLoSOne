(lp0
VTokens in well-formed sentences participate in a number of syntactic and semantic relationships with other tokens, so one might expect that accounting for heterogenous structural relationships between tokens will improve the coherence of the output sentence
p1
aVEven though compression is typically formulated as a token deletion task, it is evident that dropping tokens independently from an input sentence will likely not result in fluent and meaningful compressive text

aVFollowing this, § 2.3 discusses a dynamic program to find maximum weight bigram subsequences from the input sentence, while § 2.4 covers LP relaxation-based approaches for approximating solutions to the problem of finding a maximum-weight subtree in a graph of potential output dependencies
