<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In bringing in extra-linguistic information to learn word representations, our work falls into the general domain of multimodal learning; while other work has used visual information to improve distributed representations [] , this work generally exploits information about the object being described (e.g.,, strawberry and a picture of a strawberry); in contrast, we use information about the speaker to learn representations that vary according to contextual variables from the speaker u'\u2019' s perspective</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A joint model has three a priori advantages over independent models i) sharing data across variable values encourages representations across those values to be similar; e.g.,, while city may be closer to Boston in Massachusetts and Chicago in Illinois, in both places it still generally connotes a municipality ; (ii) such sharing can mitigate data sparseness for less-witnessed areas; and (iii) with a joint model, all representations are guaranteed to be in the same vector space and can therefore be compared to each other; with individual models (each with different initializations), word vectors across different states may not be directly compared</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The final prediction over the output vocabulary is then found by passing this resulting vector through</a>
