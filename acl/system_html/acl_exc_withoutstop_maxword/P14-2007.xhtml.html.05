<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With regard to this, we introduce a metric called sentiment annotation complexity (SAC</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Also, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensemble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences</a>
