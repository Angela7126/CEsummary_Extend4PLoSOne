<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>RAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We compared the RAkEL algorithm with single-label (SL) classification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>RAkEL overcomes this limitation by constructing a set of LP classifiers, which are trained with different random subsets of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Secondly, for Decision Tree (with predicted history) , 29 classifiers were also trained, but this time the input included the previous decisions made by the previous classifiers (i.e., the history) as well as the set of time-series data in order to emulate the dependencies in the dataset</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The LP method transforms the ML task, into one single-label multi-class classification task, where the possible set of predicted variables for the transformed class is the powerset of labels present in the original dataset</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>RAkEL tackles this problem by constructing an ensemble of LP classifiers and training each one on a different random subset of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The rule-based system and the RL system have lower accuracy compared to the ML system</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>ML classification achieved significantly higher accuracy, which was expected as it is a supervised learning method</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
