<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We run a second order dependency parser trained on the English Penn Treebank corpus to generate the parse trees of the compressed sentences</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Trevor et al. proposed synchronous tree substitution grammar [ 5 ] , which allows local distortion of the tree topology and can thus naturally capture structural mismatches</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our method extends Eisner u'\u2019' s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span, resulting in O u'\u2062' ( n 6 ) time complexity and O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) space complexity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Experiments on the popular Edinburgh dataset show that the proposed approach is 10 times faster than a high-performance commercial ILP solver</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>They used Integer Linear Programming (ILP) for inference which requires exponential running time in the worst case</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The learning task is to estimate the feature weight vector based on the manually compressed sentences</a>
