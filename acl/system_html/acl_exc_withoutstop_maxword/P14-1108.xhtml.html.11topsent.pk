Vwhere c u'\u005cu2062' ( w i - n + 1 i ) provides the frequency count that sequence w i - n + 1 i occurs in training data, D is a discount value (which depends on the frequency of the sequence) and u'\u005cu0393' h u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' h depends on D and is the interpolation factor to mix in the lower order distribution 1 1 The factors u'\u005cu0393' and D are quite technical and lengthy
p1
aVAmong other techniques, skip n -grams have also been considered as an approach to overcome problems of data sparsity []
p2
aVHowever, with their restriction on a subsequence of words, skip n -grams are also used as a technique to overcome data sparsity []
p3
aVModified Kneser-Ney implements smoothing by interpolating between higher and lower order n -gram language models
p4
aVLanguage Models are a probabilistic approach for predicting the occurrence of a sequence of words
p5
aVWe learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison
p6
aVThe data sets cover different domains and languages
p7
aVWe provide a framework for using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing
