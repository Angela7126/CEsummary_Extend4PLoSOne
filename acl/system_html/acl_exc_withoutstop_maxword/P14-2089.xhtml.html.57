<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We trained 200-dimensional embeddings and used output embeddings for measuring similarity</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The cbow and RCM objectives use separate data for learning</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose a new training objective for learning word embeddings that incorporates prior knowledge</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, we include only RCM results trained on PPDB, but show evaluations on both PPDB and WordNet</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While RCM learns embeddings suited to specific tasks based on knowledge resources, cbow learns embeddings for words not included in the resource but appear in a corpus</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our model builds on word2vec [] , a neural network based language model that learns word embeddings by maximizing the probability of raw text</a>
