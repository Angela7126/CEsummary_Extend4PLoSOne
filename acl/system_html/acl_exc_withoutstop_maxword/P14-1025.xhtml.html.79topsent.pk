V1) the well-documented difficulties of sense tagging with fine-grained \u005csmaller WordNet senses [] ; (2) the regular update cycle of \u005csmaller Macmillan (meaning it contains many recently-emerged senses); and (3) the finding in a preliminary sense-tagging task that it better captured Twitter usages than \u005csmaller WordNet (and also \u005csmaller OntoNotes

aVWe further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u005cu2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus

aVFor each dataset, we use HDP to induce topics for each target lemma, compute the similarity between the topics and the \u005csmaller WordNet senses (Equation ( 1 )), and rank the senses based on the prevalence scores (Equation ( 2
