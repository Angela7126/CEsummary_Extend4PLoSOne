<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The semantic aspects expressed by prepositions, modals, particles and verb tenses in English in general correspond to specific morphemes attached to the corresponding word stem</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Turkish, being a fairly scrambling language, uses case markers to denote the syntactic functions of nouns and noun groups</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, when we use the *NONE* tag, permute the nodes and choose the full inflected forms of the glosses in the Turkish tree, we have a powerful method to convert subtrees to an inflected word</a>
