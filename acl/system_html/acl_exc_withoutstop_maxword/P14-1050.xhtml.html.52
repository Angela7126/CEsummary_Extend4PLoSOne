<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on the statistics shown in Table 3 , the likelihood ratio tests (LRT) model captures the statistical association between a pattern p and a word w by employing the following formula</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In these works, new word detection is considered as an integral part of segmentation, where new words are identified as the most probable segments inferred by the probabilistic models; and the detected new word can be further used to improve word segmentation</a>
