<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To address this task, we provide a large and freely available annotated dataset, and propose methods for coping with it</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>First, some relatively complex steps of the implied SRL task are avoided in our setting, while on the other hand it covers more relevant cases</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since our task and dataset are novel, there is no direct baseline with which we can compare this result</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This comparison shows that the contribution of our new features (3%) is meaningful, which is also statistically significant with</a>
