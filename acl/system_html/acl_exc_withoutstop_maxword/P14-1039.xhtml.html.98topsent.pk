VUsing the averaged perceptron algorithm [ 8 ] , White Rajkumar [ 35 ] trained a structured prediction ranking model to combine these existing syntactic models with several n -gram language models
p1
aVWith this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar u'\u005cu2019' s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model
p2
aVTo select preferred outputs from the chart, we use White Rajkumar u'\u005cu2019' s [ 35 , 36 ] realization ranking model, recently augmented with a large-scale 5-gram model based on the Gigaword corpus
p3
aVRajkumar White u'\u005cu2019' s experiments confirmed the efficacy of the features based on Jaeger u'\u005cu2019' s work, including information density u'\u005cu2013' based features, in a local classification model
p4
aVSimple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u005cu2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model u'\u005cu2019' s BLEU score of 87.93
p5
aVThe model takes as its starting point two probabilistic models of syntax that have been developed for CCG parsing, Hockenmaier Steedman u'\u005cu2019' s [ 14 ] generative model and Clark Curran u'\u005cu2019' s [ 7 ] normal-form model
p6
aV2 2 Note that the features from the local classification model for that -complementizer choice have not yet been incorporated into OpenCCG u'\u005cu2019' s global realization ranking model, and thus do not inform the baseline realization choices in this work
p7
aVTherefore, to develop a more nuanced self-monitoring reranker that is more robust to such parsing mistakes, we trained an SVM using dependency precision and recall features for all three parses, their n -best parsing results, and per-label precision and recall for each type of dependency, together with the realizer u'\u005cu2019' s normalized perceptron model score
