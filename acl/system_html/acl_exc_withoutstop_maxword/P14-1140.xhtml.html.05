<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we split the phrase pair embedding into two parts to model the translation confidence directly translation confidence with sparse features and translation confidence with recurrent neural network</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The sparse features are phrase pairs in translation table, and recurrent neural network is utilized to learn a smoothed translation score with the source and target side information</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We use recurrent neural network to generate two smoothed translation confidence scores based on source and target word embeddings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So as to integrate such global information, and also keep the ability to generate tree structure, we combine the recurrent neural network and the recursive neural network to be a recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN</a>
