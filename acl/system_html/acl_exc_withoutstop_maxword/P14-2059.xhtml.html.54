<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We tested three different approaches to generating a document u'\u2019' s VSM representation internal representations , which are based on the contents of the document, external representations , which are built using a document u'\u2019' s incoming link citation contexts (following Ritchie ( 2009 ) and He et al</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This representation can be based on any information found in the document collection, excluding the document d itself e.g., the text of the referenced document and the text of documents that cite it</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Whether this is because the descriptions of these papers in the contexts of incoming link citations capture the essence or key relevance of the paper, or whether this effect is due to authors reusing their work or to these descriptions originating in a seed paper and being then propagated through the literature, remain interesting research questions that we intend to tackle in future work</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our ultimate goal is matching claims and comparing methods, which would likely benefit from an analysis of the full contents of the document and not just previous citations of it, so in future work we also intend to use the context from the successful external results as training data for a summarisation stage</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The external representations ( inlink_context ) are based on extracting the context around citation tokens to the document from other documents</a>
