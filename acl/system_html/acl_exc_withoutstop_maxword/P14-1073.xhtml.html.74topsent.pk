VTo select a parent for a mention x of type t = x e t , a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and u'\u005cu2662' is selected with probability proportional to u'\u005cu0391' t 0

aVOur model is an evolutionary generative process based on the name variation model of , which stipulates that names are often copied from previously generated names, perhaps with mutation (spelling edits
p2
aVTo apply our model to the CDCR task, we observe that the probability that two name mentions are coreferent is the probability that they arose from a common ancestor in the phylogeny

aVName similarity is also an important component of within -document coreference resolution, and efforts in
