<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Supervised Batch Approaches The vast majority of work on predicting latent user attributes in social media apply supervised static SVM models for discrete categorical e.g.,, gender and regression models for continuous attributes e.g.,, age with lexical bag-of-word features for classifying user gender [ 11 , 31 , 5 , 38 ] , age [ 31 , 22 , 21 ] or political orientation</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To investigate all types of social relationships between Twitter users and construct Twitter social graphs we collect lists of followers and friends, and extract user mentions, hashtags, replies and retweets from communications</a>
