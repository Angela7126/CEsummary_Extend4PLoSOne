<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The basic idea involves encoding of class labels as artificial words which are u'\u201c' sprinkled u'\u201d' (appended) to training documents</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1</a>
