<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Such an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions u'\u2014' and predominant senses too u'\u2014' vary from corpus to corpus</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because of domain differences and the skewed nature of word sense distributions, it is often the case that some senses in a sense inventory will not be attested in a given corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The predominant sense and distribution across senses for each target lemma was obtained by aggregating over the sense annotations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The word senses are ranked based on these similarity scores, and the most frequent sense is selected for the corpus that the distributional similarity thesaurus was trained</a>
