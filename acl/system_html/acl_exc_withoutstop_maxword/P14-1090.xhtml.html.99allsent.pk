(lp0
VThese properties, along with the sibling relationship to the topic node, are important cues for answering the question
p1
aVThus for the Freebase graph, we use relations (with directions) and properties as features for each node
p2
aVGiven a topic, we selectively roll out the Freebase graph by choosing those nodes within a few hops of relationship to the topic node , and form a topic graph
p3
aVif a node was tagged with a question feature, then replace this node with its question feature, e.g.,, what u'\u005cu2192' qword=what;
p4
aVWe define answer node as the node that is the answer and answer relation as the relation from the answer node to its direct parent
p5
aVspecial case) if a qtopic node was tagged as a named entity, then replace this node with its its named entity form, e.g.,, bieber u'\u005cu2192' qtopic=person;
p6
aVWe treat QA on Freebase as a binary classification task for each node in the topic graph, we extract features and judge whether it is the answer node
p7
aVWe combine question features and Freebase features (per node) by doing a pairwise concatenation
p8
aVUnfortunately Freebase does not contain an exact relation called brother , but instead sibling
p9
aVThus assuming there is an alignment model that is able to tell how likely one relation maps to the original question, we add extra alignment-based features for the incoming and outgoing relation of each node
p10
aVThus further inference (i.e.,, brother u'\u005cu2194' male sibling) has to be made
p11
aVFurthermore, the reason that we have kept some lexical features, such as brother , is that we hope to learn from training a high correlation between brother and some Freebase relations and properties (such as sibling and male ) if we do not possess an external resource to help us identify such a correlation
p12
aV1) u'\u005cu201c' basic u'\u005cu201d' features include feature productions read off from the feature graph (Figure 1 ); 2) u'\u005cu201c' + word overlap u'\u005cu201d' adds additional features on whether sub-relations have overlap with the question; and 3) u'\u005cu201c' + CluewebMapping u'\u005cu201d' adds the ranking of relation prediction given the question according to CluewebMapping
p13
aVFor instance, for common celebrity gossip questions like who cheated on celebrity A , it is hard for a system to find the Freebase relation celebrity.infidelity.participant as the target relation if it had not observed this pattern in training
p14
aVFor example, the person.parents relationship helps answering questions about parenthood
p15
aVThus for the question, who is the father of King George VI , we ask two questions does the mapping, 1 coverage) contain the answer relation people.person.parents
p16
aVW eb Q uestions not only has answers annotated, but also which Freebase topic nodes the answers come from
p17
aVGiven that turkers annotated answers based on the topic page via a browser, this supports the assumption that the same answer would be located in the topic graph, which is then passed to the QA engine for feature extraction and classification
p18
aVFor the edge, prep_of(qfocus=name, brother) , this would mean the following features qfocus=name , brother , qfocus=name u'\u005cu2223' brother , and qfocus=name u'\u005cu2223' prep_of u'\u005cu2223' brother
p19
aVThe L1 regularization encourages sparse features by driving feature weights towards zero, which was ideal for the over-generated feature space
p20
aVFor example, for the question who cheated on celebrity A , answers can be retrieved via the Freebase relation celebrity.infidelity.participant , but the connection between the phrase cheated on and the formal KB relation is not explicit
p21
aVWith regards to the question, we know we are looking for the name of a person based on the following
p22
aVSome of the mapping can be simply detected as paraphrasing or lexical overlap
p23
aVFor instance, both people.person.parents and fictional_universe.fictional_character.parents indicate the parent relationship but the latter is much less commonly annotated
p24
aVThen we computed how much and how well the answer relation was triggered by ReverbMapping and CluewebMapping
p25
aVIf you asked someone what is the name of justin bieber brother , 3 3 All examples used in this paper come from the training data crawled from Google Suggest
p26
aVThis simple example points out that every part of the question could change what the question inquires eventually
p27
aVWe split each html document by sentences [ 21 ] using NLTK [ 3 ] and extracted those with at least two Freebase entities which has at least one direct established relation according to Freebase
p28
aVThen features are extracted in the following form with s the source and t the target node, for every edge e u'\u005cu2062' ( s , t ) in the graph, extract s , t , s u'\u005cu2223' t and s u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2223' e u'\u005cu2223' u'\u005cu2062' t as features
p29
aVFor the film.film.directed_by relation, some important stop words that could indicate this relation, such as by and with , rank directly after director and direct
p30
aVThese percentage numbers are good clue for feature design for instance, we may be confident in a relation if it is ranked top 5 or 10 by CluewebMapping
p31
aVAs a simple baseline, u'\u005cu201c' word overlap u'\u005cu201d' counts the overlap between relations and the question
p32
aVThe API returns almost identical information as displayed via a web browser to a user viewing this topic
p33
aV2013 ) ) if a predicted answer list does not have a perfect match with all gold answers, as a lot of questions in W eb Q uestions contain more than one answer
p34
aVThus we were firstly interested in the coverage of mined relation mappings
p35
aVWith the recent growth in KBs such as DBPedia [ 1 ] , Freebase [ 4 ] and Yago2 [ 18 ] , it has become more practical to consider answering questions across wider domains, with commercial systems including Google Now , based on Google u'\u005cu2019' s Knowledge Graph , and Facebook Graph Search , based on social network connections
p36
aVFor instance, for the film.actor.film relation (mapping from film names to actor names), the top words given by P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) are won , star , among , show
p37
aVBoth ClueWeb and its Freebase annotation has a bias
p38
aVWe evaluated on the training set in two aspects coverage and prediction performance
p39
aVTreating the aligned pairs as observation , the co-occurrence matrix between aligning relations and words was computed
p40
aVSince the relations on one side of these pairs are not natural sentences, we ran the most simple IBM alignment Model 1 [ 5 ] to estimate the translation probability with GIZA++ [ 30 ]
p41
aVThus we took out the word overlapping and CluewebMapping based features, and the new F 1 on test was 36.9 u'\u005cu2062' %
p42
aV2013 ) , who collected thousands of commonly asked questions by crawling the Google Suggest service
p43
aVThus we evaluated the ranking of retrieval with the gold standard annotation on train-all , shown in Table 3
p44
aV2013 ) originally used it they employed a discriminative log-linear model to judge relations and that might yield better performance
p45
aVBy counting how many times each relation R was annotated, we can estimate P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r
p46
aVTable 3 ), thus we also tested on the top 10 results returned by the Search API
p47
aVWe computed standard MAP (Mean Average Precision) and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), shown in Table 2 (a
p48
aVAs a fair comparison, ranking of CluewebMapping under uniform distribution is also included in Table 2 (a
p49
aVThe Information Extraction (IE) community approaches QA differently first performing relatively coarse information retrieval as a way to triage the set of possible answer candidates, and only then attempting to perform deeper analysis
p50
aVThus we need to count for each word w in Q
p51
aVReverbMapping does the same, except that we took a uniform distribution on P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) since the contributed dataset did not include co-occurrence counts to estimate these probabilities
p52
aVDue to the bias and incompleteness of any data source, we approximate the true probability of P with P ~ under our specific model
p53
aVMore recent research started to minimize this direct supervision by using latent meaning representations [ 2 , 24 ] or distant supervision [ 23 ]
p54
aVThe extraction formed two parallel corpora, one with u'\u005cu201c' relation - sentence u'\u005cu201d' pairs (for estimating P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) ) and the other with u'\u005cu201c' subrelations - sentence u'\u005cu201d' pairs (for P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r )
p55
aVResearchers in semantic parsing have recently explored QA over Freebase as a way of moving beyond closed domains such as GeoQuery [ 35 ]
p56
aV2013 ) also used ClueWeb indirectly through ReVerb
p57
aVOur work pushes the data challenge to the limit by mining directly from ClueWeb , a 5TB collection of web data
p58
aVWe took this as a u'\u005cu201c' good enough u'\u005cu201d' IR front-end and used it on test
p59
aVPerformance is thus bounded by the accuracy of the original semantic parsing, and the well-formedness of resultant database queries
p60
aVWhile making semantic parsing more robust is a laudable goal, here we provide a more rigorous IE baseline against which those efforts should be compared we show that u'\u005cu201c' traditional u'\u005cu201d' IE methodology can significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art as reported in the semantic parsing literature, with a relative gain of  34% F 1 as compared to Berant et al
p61
aVThese systems were limited to closed-domains due to a lack of knowledge resources, computing power, and ability to robustly understand natural language
p62
aVOne challenge for natural language querying against a KB is the relative informality of queries as compared to the grammar of a KB
p63
aVWe will view a KB as an interlinked collection of u'\u005cu201c' topics u'\u005cu201d'
p64
aVWe call this a question feature graph , with every node and relation a potential feature for this question
p65
aVFor each question, we extracted all relations in its corresponding topic graph, and ranked each relation with whether it is the answer relation
p66
aVquestion topic ( qtopic

aV2 precision) predict the answer relation from the question

aVWith an Information Retrieval (IR) front-end, we need to locate the exact Freebase topic node a question is about
p72
aVThe topic of the question helps us find relevant Freebase pages
p73
aVThey are lowercased and some contain typos and gave them access to Freebase, that person might first determine that the question is about Justin Bieber (or his brother), go to Justin Bieber u'\u005cu2019' s Freebase page, and search for his brother u'\u005cu2019' s name
p74
aVFreebase uses a dummy parent node for a list of nodes with the same relation.]
p75
aVAdditionally, we have analyzed how Freebase relations map back to the question
p76
aVThen the question features (§ 4.1 ) and node features (§ 4.2 ) were combined (§ 4.3 ) for each node
p77
aV[Ranking on answer relations
p78
aVWe simply apply a named entity recognizer to find the question topic
p79
aVBesides incoming and/or outgoing relationships, nodes also have properties a string that describes the attribute of a node, for instance, node type, gender or height (for a person
p80
aVBoth relationship and property of a node are important to identifying the answer
p81
aVIn this section we describe a u'\u005cu201c' translation u'\u005cu201d' table between Freebase relations and NL words was built
p82
aVFor instance, without the properties type:person and gender:male , we would not have known the node Jaxon Bieber represents a male person
p83
aVWe aim to maximally automate the answer extraction process, by massively combining discriminative features for both the question and the topic graph
p84
aVOne major difference between relations and properties is that both arguments of a relation are nodes, while only one argument of a property is a node, the other a string
p85
aVthe dependency relation nn(brother, bieber) and the facts that, (i) Bieber is a person and (ii) a person u'\u005cu2019' s brother should also be a person, indicate that the name is about a person
p86
aVOnce a topic is obtained we query the Freebase Topic API [ 14 ] to retrieve all relevant information, resulting in a topic graph
p87
aVThey connect the nodes with the question and describe some unique characteristics
p88
aVWhen given a question about one or several topics, we can select a u'\u005cu201c' view u'\u005cu201d' of the KB concerning only involved topics, then inspect every related node within a few hops of relations to the topic node in order to extract the answer
p89
aVQuestion verbs are also good hints of answer types
p90
aVTo keep things simple, we did not perform answer voting, but simply extracted answers from the first (ranked by the Search API) topic node with predicted answer(s) found
p91
aVTable 1 shows the coverage of CluewebMapping, which covers 93.0 u'\u005cu2062' % of all answer relations
p92
aVCluewebMapping successfully ranked 19 u'\u005cu2062' % of answer relations as top 1
p93
aVthe dependency relation nsubj(what, name) and prep_of(name, brother) indicates that the question seeks the information of a name; 4 4 We use the Stanford collapsed dependency form
p94
aVFor instance, for the previous example question, we want to rank the relation people.person.parents as number 1
p95
aVthe dependency relation prep_of(name, brother) indicates that the name is about a brother (but we do not know whether it is a person name yet);
p96
aVWe call such a view a topic graph and assume answers can be found within the graph
p97
aVThe idea is very similar they intersected Freebase relations with predicates in (arg1, predicate, arg2) triples extracted from ReVerb to learn the mapping between Freebase relations and triple predicates
p98
aVquestion focus ( qfocus ), a cue of expected answer types, such as name/money/time
p99
aVIn this way we hope to capture the association between question patterns and answer nodes
p100
aVThen we convert the dependency parse into a more generic question graph, in the following steps
p101
aVAlso, we did an ablation test on dev about how additional features on the mapping between Freebase relations and the original questions help, with three feature settings
p102
aVNote that there can be more than one topic in the question
p103
aVquestion verb ( qverb ), such as is/play/take , extracted from the main verb of the question
p104
aVThe learning problem is challenging for about 3000 questions in train , there are 3 million nodes ( 1000 nodes per topic graph), and 7 million feature types
p105
aVAll questions were annotated with answers from Freebase
p106
aVThe objective is to find the most likely relation a question prompts
p107
aVOur system learned, for instance, when the question asks for geographic adjacency information ( qverb=border ), the correct answer relation to look for is location.adjoins
p108
aVTable 4 shows that the additional CluewebMapping features improved overall F 1 by 5 u'\u005cu2062' % , a 13 u'\u005cu2062' % relative improvement a remarkable gain given that the model already learned a strong correlation between question types and answer types (explained more in discussion and Table 6 later
p109
aVTable 2 (b) further shows the percentage of answer relations with respect to their ranking
p110
aVIn a more realistic scenario, we had already evaluated that the Freebase Search API returned the correct topic node 95 u'\u005cu2062' % of the time in its top 10 results (c.f
p111
aVThe combination between questions and Freebase nodes captures some real gist of QA pattern typing, shown in Table 6 with sampled features and weights
p112
aVHowever, most Freebase relations are framed in a way that is not commonly addressed in natural language questions
p113

p116
aVAll questions contain at least one answer from Freebase
p117
aVNote that the median rank from CluewebMapping is only 12, indicating that half of all answer relations are ranked in the top 12
p118
aVIn contrast, ReverbMapping covers 89.7 u'\u005cu2062' % of the answer relations
p119
aVArguments of relations are usually interconnected, e.g.,, London can be the place_of_birth for Justin Bieber , or capital_of the UK
p120
aVWe describe such an alignment model in § 5
p121
aVThe converted graph is shown in Figure 1 (a), right side
p122
aVTable 5 gives the final F 1 on test u'\u005cu201c' Gold Retrieval u'\u005cu201d' always ranked the correct topic node top 1, a perfect IR front-end assumption
p123
aVWe propose instead to learn discriminative features from the data with shallow question analysis
p124
aVOur model is inspired by an intuition on how everyday people search for answers
p125
aVAs a comparison, we used a dataset of relation mapping contributed by Berant et al
p126
aVFor this purpose we used the Freebase Search API [ 13 ] .All named entities 8 8 When no named entities are detected, we fall back to noun phrases in a question were sent to this API, which returned a ranked list of relevant topics
p127
aVFinally the ranking (e.g.,, top 1/2/5/10/100 and beyond) of each relation is used as features instead of a pure probability
p128
aVHere we instead directly mine relation mappings from ClueWeb and show that both direct relation mapping precision and indirect QA F 1 improve by a large margin
p129
aVFor instance, in a loglinear model setting, we expect to learn a high feature weight for features like
p130
aVFor instance, for the question who is the father of King George VI , the most likely relation we look for is people.person.parents
p131
aVWe keep our analysis simple and do not use a question classifier, but simply extract the noun dependent of qword as qfocus
p132
aVGiven these two resources, for each binary Freebase relation, we can find a collection of sentences each of which contains both of its arguments, then simply learn how words in these sentences are associated with this relation, i.e.,, P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r
p133
aVIn the following we describe how we represent this process
p134
aVquestion word ( qword ), such as what/who/how many
p135
aVMore interestingly, for the question who is the father of the Periodic Table , the actual relation that encodes its original meaning is law.invention.inventor , rather than people.person.parents
p136
aVArguments of properties are attributes that are only u'\u005cu201c' attached u'\u005cu201d' to certain nodes and have no outgoing edges
p137
aV2013 ) learned question paraphrases from aligning multiple questions with the same answers generated by WikiAnswers
p138
aVWe instead attack the problem of QA from a KB from an IE perspective we learn directly the pattern of QA pairs, represented by the dependency parse of questions and the Freebase structure of answer candidates, without the use of intermediate, general purpose meaning representations
p139
aVOne question of interest is whether our system, aided by the massive web data, can be fairly compared to the semantic parsing approaches (note that Berant et al
p140
aVWe show one example in Figure 1 (a), left side
p141
aVCluewebMapping ranks each relation by P ~ ( R u'\u005cu2223' Q
p142
aVSpecifically, for each relation r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l in a topic graph, we compute P ( r e l u'\u005cu2223' q u e s t i o n ) to rank the relations
p143
aVdrop any leaf node that is a determiner, preposition or punctuation
p144
aVNote the scale difference although ReVerb was also extracted from ClueWeb09, there were only 15 million triples to intersect with the relations, while we had 1.2 billion alignment pairs
p145
aVThis motivates the design of dependency-based features
p146
aVTo alleviate this problem, the best attempt so far is to map from ReVerb [ 10 ] predicate-argument triples to Freebase relation triples [ 6 , 2 ]
p147
aVEvery question was processed by the Stanford CoreNLP suite with the caseless model
p148
aVFor instance, the sub-relations of people.person.parents are people , person , and parents
p149
aVWe next formally evaluate how the learned mapping help predict relations from words
p150
aVTo put it more formally, given a question Q of a word vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' , we want to find out the relation R that maximizes the probability P ( R u'\u005cu2223' Q )
p151
aVThe other question of interest is that whether our system has acquired some level of u'\u005cu201c' machine intelligence u'\u005cu201d' how much does it know what the question inquires
p152
aVWe call this dataset ReverbMapping and ours CluewebMapping
p153
aVAmong them, we were able to learn the rule mapping using more than 10 thousand relation-sentence pairs for each of the 89.5 u'\u005cu2062' % of all answer relations
p154
aVFor example, we learn that given a question concerning money , such as what money is used in ukraine , the expected answer type is likely currency

aVNote that the left is a real but incorrect parse.]
p156
aVFACC1, the Freebase Annotation of the ClueWeb Corpus version 1 [ 15 ] , contains index and offset of Freebase entities within the English portion of ClueWeb
p157
aVWe show with examples why these features make sense later in § 6 Table 6
p158
aVIn answering our example query a person might take into consideration multiple constraints
p159
aVAfter training, we had around 30 thousand features with non-zero weights, a 200 fold reduction from the original features
p160
aVQuestion answering (QA) from a knowledge base (KB) has a long history within natural language processing, going back to the 1960s and 1970s, with systems such as Baseball [ 16 ] and Lunar [ 38 ]
p161
aVThe model challenge involves finding the best meaning representation for the question, converting it into a query and executing the query on the KB
p162
aVTo conclude, we found that CluewebMapping provides satisfying coverage on the 3778 training questions only 7 u'\u005cu2062' % were missing, despite the biased nature of web data
p163
aVNext we evaluated the prediction performance, using the evaluation metrics of information retrieval
p164
aVIt contains 3778 training and 2032 test questions collected from the Google Suggest service
p165
aVOne other reason that we estimated P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r ) for sub-relations is that Freebase relations share some common structures in between them
p166
aVIt contains 5810 questions crawled from the Google Suggest service, with answers annotated on Amazon Mechanical Turk
p167
aVThere were 10,484 relations and sub-relations in all, and we kept the top 20,000 words
p168
aVWith a high performance learner we have found that a system with millions of features can be trained within hours, leading to intuitive, human interpretable features
p169
aVAlso, CluewebMapping gives reasonably good precision on its prediction, despite the noisy nature of web data
p170
aVThis combination greatly enlarges the total number of features, but owing to progress in large-scale machine learning such feature spaces are less of a concern than they once were (concrete numbers in § 6 Model Tuning
p171
aVThe data challenge is more formally framed as ontology or (textual) schema matching [ 17 , 33 , 9 ] matching structure of two ontologies/databases or (in extension) mapping between KB relations and NL text

aVThe learning task can be framed in the following short steps
p209
aVHowever, due to significant popular interest in certain news categories, and the resultant catering by websites to those information desires, then for example we also learned a heavily correlated connection between Jennifer Aniston and celebrity.infidelity.victim , and between some other you-know-who names and celebrity.infidelity.participant

aVResults are reported in terms of macro F 1 with partial credit (following Berant et al
p215
aVMost work approaches this via the bridge of various intermediate representations, including combinatory categorial grammar (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007, 2009; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010, 2011, 2013), synchronous context-free grammars [ 37 ] , dependency trees [ 27 , 2 ] , string kernels [ 20 , 7 ] , and tree transducers [ 19 ]

aVWe further randomly divided train-all by 80 u'\u005cu2062' % / 20 u'\u005cu2062' % to a smaller train and development set dev
p239
aVThe final F 1 of 42.0 u'\u005cu2062' % gives a relative improvement over previous best result [ 2 ] of 31.4 u'\u005cu2062' % by one third
