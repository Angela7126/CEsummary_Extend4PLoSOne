<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of [] as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method MetaCost of [] as a cost-aware learning method</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus there is no need for a syntactic analysis of the context considered when exploiting the resource, and sparsity is less of an issue 1 1 Whenever two predicates with the same lemma have common neighbours, we average the score of the pairs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u2019' s score; r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' g b - a is defined similarly and again we consider as features the min, max and log-product of these ranks</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, we take into account the frequencies of items within the text, with three features as before the min of the frequencies of the two related items, the max, and the log-product</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even</a>
