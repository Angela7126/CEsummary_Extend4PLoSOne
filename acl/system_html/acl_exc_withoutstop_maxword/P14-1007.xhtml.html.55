<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The main points of difference are in the robustness of the system and in the degree of tailoring of both the rules for determining scope on the logical form level and the rules for handling semantically vacuous elements</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, the string-based annotations also include words which the ERG treats as semantically vacuous</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus in order to match the gold annotations, we define a set of heuristics for when to count vacuous words as in scope</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our crawling rules operate on semantic representations, but the annotations are with reference to the surface string</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We combine our system with the outputs from the best-performing 2012 submission, the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12, firstly by relying on the latter for system negation cue detection, 4 4 \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 predicted cues using a closed vocabulary assumption with a supervised classifier to disambiguate instances of cues and secondly as a fall-back in system combination as described in 3.4 below</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To shed more light on specific strengths and weaknesses of our approach, we performed a manual error analysis of scope predictions by Crawler, starting from gold cues so as to</a>
