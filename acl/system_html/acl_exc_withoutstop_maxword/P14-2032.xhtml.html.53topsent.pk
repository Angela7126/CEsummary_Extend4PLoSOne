VIn this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition
p1
aVIn this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition
p2
aVA powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time
p3
aVDual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]
