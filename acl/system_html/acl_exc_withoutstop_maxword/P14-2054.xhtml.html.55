<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are two rules for merging spans one merges two complete spans into an incomplete span, the other merges an incomplete span and a complete span into a large complete span</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A span is a subtree over a number of consecutive words, with the leftmost or the rightmost word as its root</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the right span is left-headed, there are two cases its leftmost word is kept, or no word in the span is kept</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our method extends Eisner u'\u2019' s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span, resulting in O u'\u2062' ( n 6 ) time complexity and O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) space complexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The two complete spans must be single words, as the length of the virtual arc is 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We drop the signature of the virtual arc number from each span, and thus obtain an O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) time algorithm</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can reversely get the the compressed parse tree by removing all</a>
