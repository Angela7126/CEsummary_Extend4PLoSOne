<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The batch model is built by learning only from the training data and is evaluated on the test set without exploiting information from the test instances</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Evaluation is carried out by measuring the performance of the batch (learning only from the training set), the adaptive (learning from the training set and adapting to the test set), and the empty (learning from scratch from the test set) models in terms of global MAE scores on the test set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Large values indicate a low similarity between training and test data and a more challenging scenario for the learning algorithms</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Focusing on the adaptability to user and domain changes, we report the results of comparative experiments with two online algorithms and the standard batch approach</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a final analysis of our results, we investigated how the performance of the different types of models ( batch , adaptive , empty ) relates to the distance between training and test sets</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The result is one training set and one test set for each post-editor within the same domain</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This demonstrates that, as expected, the online algorithms do not take advantage of test data with a label distribution similar to the training set</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This also holds when the amount of test points to learn from is limited, as in the L domain where the test set contains only 80 instances</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is a strong evidence of the fact that, in case of domain changes, online models can still learn from new test instances even if they have a label distribution similar to the training set</a>
