<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>[ 15 ] , the bigram embeddings are pre-trained on unlabeled data with character embeddings, which significantly improves the model performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Tensor-based transformation was also used in other neural network models for its ability to capture multiple interactions in data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Previous work found that the performance can be improved by pre-training the character embeddings on large unlabeled data and using the obtained embeddings to initialize the character lookup table instead of random initialization [ 15 , 35 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, the transition score in equation (4) is not necessary in our model, because, by incorporating tag embedding into the neural network, the effect of tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction are covered uniformly in</a>
