<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that there is no good translation of ROUGE for hierarchical summarization</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since most of the sentence contributions depend on the path from the root to the sentence, we build our partial summary by incrementally adding a sentence top-down in the hierarchy and from first sentence to last within a cluster summary</a>
