<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u2018' birth cluster u'\u2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The sense change detected was categorized as to whether it was a new sense (birth), a single sense got split into two or more senses (split) or two or more senses got merged (join) or a particular sense died (death</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Similarly, for a candidate sense change from t u'\u2062' v i to t u'\u2062' v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t u'\u2062' v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t u'\u2062' v i with any time interval t u'\u2062' v k , intermediate between t u'\u2062' v i and t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Word sense disambiguation as well as word sense discovery have both remained key areas of research right from the very early initiatives in natural language processing research</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Remarkably, comparison with the English WordNet indicates that in 44% cases, as identified by our algorithm, there has been a birth of a completely novel sense, in 46% cases a new sense has split off from an older sense and in 43% cases two or more older senses have merged in to form a new sense</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Toward this objective we make the following contributions a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate</a>
