<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So far, we have treated LS and discourse as distinct features in the reranking model, However, given that LS features greatly improve the CR baseline, we hypothesize that a natural extension to the discourse models would be to make use of LS similarity (in addition to the traditional information retrieval similarity) to label discourse segments</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To tease apart the relative contribution of discourse features that occur only within a single sentence versus features that span multiple sentences, we examined the performance of the full model when using only intra-sentence features, i.e.,, SR0 features for DMM, and features based on discourse relations where both EDUs appear in the same sentence for DPM, versus the full intersentence models</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because these discourse models appear to capture high-level information about answer structures, we hypothesize that the models should make use</a>
