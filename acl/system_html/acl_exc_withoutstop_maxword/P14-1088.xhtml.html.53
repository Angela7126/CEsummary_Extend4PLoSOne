<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Instead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' [] and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>LAS order the corpora NDT 3, 2, 1, CDT da, en, it, es, PCEDT, whereas u'\u0391' d u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' f and u'\u0391' n u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' m gives the order NDT 2, 1, 3, PCEDT, CDT da, en, it, es, and u'\u0391' p u'\u2062' l u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' n gives the same order as the other alphas but with CDT es and it changing places</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These metrics express agreement on a nominal coding task as the ratio u'\u039a' , u'\u03a0' = A o - A e / 1 - A e where A o is the observed agreement and A e the expected agreement according to some model of u'\u201c' random u'\u201d' annotation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by \citeN Fournier13</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The data studied in this work has previously been used by \citeN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The u'\u0394' d u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' f function causes an extreme shift of the distances towards 0; more than 30% of the sentence pairs have distance 0, 1, or 2, which causes D e d u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' f to be extremely low and thus gives disproportionally large weight to non-zero distances in D o d u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' f u'\u2062' f</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Mean LAS at p r u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' c u'\u2062' h = 1 of Figure 5 is 23.9%, clearly much higher than we would expect if the trees were completely random</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A method for perturbing phrase structure trees would also be interesting, as this would allow us to repeat</a>
