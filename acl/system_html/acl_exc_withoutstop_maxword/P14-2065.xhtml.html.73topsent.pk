VThus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet
p1
aVEven a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames
p2
aVAs noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments
p3
aVOne significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in
p4
aVIn Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2
p5
aVThus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account
p6
aVPrevious work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs [ 10 ]
p7
aVThe consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames
p8
aVThe exact semantics associated with a verb may depend on its syntactic frame
p9
aVWe next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
