<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>With the semantic phrase embeddings and the vector space transformation function, we apply the BRAE to measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates in the phrase-based SMT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the semi-supervised RAE for phrase embedding, the objective function over a (phrase, label) pair ( x , t ) includes the reconstruction error and the prediction error, as illustrated in Fig</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Assuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Accordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the</a>
