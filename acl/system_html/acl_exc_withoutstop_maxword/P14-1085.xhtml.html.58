<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, descriptions from both Summa and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since Summa was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1 , it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those from Summa</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary</a>
