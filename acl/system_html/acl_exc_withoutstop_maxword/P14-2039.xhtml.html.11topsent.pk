VTherefore, the j t u'\u005cu2062' h column of A indicates an alignment state for the j t u'\u005cu2062' h position, where the state can have one of the 2 K - 1 possible combinations
p1
aVFor the caption alignment task, we treat each individual word as a symbol in our alphabet u'\u005cu03a3'
p2
aVAs the chunk size parameter increases, the performance of sliding window systems with different values of keep-length parameter converges
p3
aVThe substitution cost for two words is estimated based on the edit distance between two words
p4
aVThe special gap symbol u'\u005cu2018' - u'\u005cu2019' represents a missing word and does not belong to u'\u005cu03a3'
p5
aVFurthermore, we can see that for smaller values of the chunk size parameter, increasing the keep-length makes the system less accurate
