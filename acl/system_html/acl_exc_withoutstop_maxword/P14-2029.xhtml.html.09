<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, we used the same learning algorithms as for our system (i.e.,, ridge regression for the ordinal task and logistic regression for the binary task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the binary task, we report percentage accuracy</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the ordinal task, we report Pearson u'\u2019' s r between the averaged human judgments and each system</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For the binary task, we used the sign test to test for significant differences in accuracy</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We flipped the sign of the misspelling feature when computing accuracy for the binary task</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality of sentences, and present a dataset of learner sentences rated for grammaticality</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality</a>
