VDomain adaptation (DA) of sentiment classification becomes extremely challenging when the distributions of words in the source and the target domains are very different, because the features learnt from the source domain labeled reviews might not appear in the target domain reviews that must be classified

aVAt test time, for each word w that appears in a target domain test sentence, we measure the similarity, sim u'\u005cu2062' ( \u005cmat u'\u005cu2062' M u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2192' \u005ccS ( i ) , w u'\u005cu2192' \u005ccT ) , and select the most similar r words u ( i ) in the source domain labeled sentences as the distributional features for w , with their values set to sim u'\u005cu2062' ( \u005cmat u'\u005cu2062' M u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2192' \u005ccS ( i ) , w u'\u005cu2192' \u005ccT
