<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Instead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, for the first time, Maskey and Zhou (2012) explored the possibility of inducing new features in an unsupervised fashion using deep belief net (DBN) [ Hinton et al.2006 ] for hierarchical phrase-based translation model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To address the first shortcoming, we adapt and extend some simple but effective phrase features as the input features for new DNN feature learning, and these features have been shown significant improvement for SMT, such as, phrase pair similarity [ Zhao et al.2004 ] , phrase frequency, phrase length [ Hopkins and May2011 ] , and phrase generative probability [ Foster et al.2010 ] , which also show further improvement for new phrase feature learning in our experiments</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>2013) presented an ITG reordering classifier based on recursive auto-encoders, and generated vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is encouraging that, non-parametric feature expansion using gaussian mixture model (GMM) [ Nguyen et al.2007 ] , which guarantees invariance to the specific embodiment of the original features, has been proved as a feasible feature generation approach for SMT</a>
