VWe evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks
p1
aVWe thus define adverbiability as the frequency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g
p2
aVWe thus define comparability as the frequency of comparative or superlative forms relative to the frequency of the base form, e.g
p3
aV1985 ) theorizes that subjective adjectives tend to develop derived adverbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives do not
p4
aVTo verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al
p5
aVUnlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ]
p6
aVWe therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions
p7
aVWe consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the frequency of occurrence as the leftmost of two adjectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings
p8
aVBolinger ( 1967 ) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions ( the cake is sweet ), rather than attributive constructions ( the German capital ) more frequently than objective adjectives
p9
aVUsing an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information
