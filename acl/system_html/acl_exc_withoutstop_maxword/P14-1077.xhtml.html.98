<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For the sake of clarity, we describe the constraints derived from each scenario of the two categories of disagreements separately</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The clues are therefore learnt from KBs, and further refined manually if needed</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We add clues according to their related relations u'\u2019' proportions in the local predictions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, Country and birthPlace take up about 30% in the local predictions, we thus add clues that are related to these two relations, and then move on with new clues related to other relations according to those relations u'\u2019' proportions in the local predictions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As is shown in Figure 4 , in both datasets, the clues related to more local predictions will solve more inconsistencies, thus are more effective</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We propose to perform joint inference upon multiple local predictions by leveraging implicit clues that are encoded with relation specific requirements and can be learnt from existing knowledge bases</a>
