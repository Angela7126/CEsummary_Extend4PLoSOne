<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Both work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Combining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and GParser ( u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' B+G u'\u201d' ), we get higher oracle score (96.37% on English and 89.72% on Chinese) and higher syntactic divergence (1.085 candidate heads per word on English, and 1.188 on Chinese) than u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' Z+G u'\u201d' , which verifies our earlier discussion that Berkeley Parser produces more different structures than ZPar</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>16K for Chinese), it is likely that the unlabeled data may overwhelm the labeled data during SGD training</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Especially, the unlabeled data with highly divergent structures leads to slightly higher improvement</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled data</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Therefore, exploiting such unlabeled data may introduce more discriminative syntactic knowledge, largely compensating labeled training data</a>
