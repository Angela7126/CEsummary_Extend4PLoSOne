VClose examination of DF statistics by Church and Gale in their work on Poisson Mixtures (1995) resulted in an analysis of the burstiness of content words
p1
aVLooking close to the y -axis in Figure 9 , we observe a second class of exclusively low frequency words whose burstiness ranges from highly concentrated to singletons
p2
aVThe first illustration of word burstiness can be seen by plotting observed inverse document frequency, IDF w , versus f w in the log domain (Figure 7
p3
aVHowever, considering this estimate in light of the two classes of words in Figure 9 , there are clearly words in Class B with high burstiness that will be ignored by trying to compensate for the high adaptation variability in the low-frequency range
p4
aVThe typical use of Document Frequency ( DF ) in information retrieval or text categorization is to emphasize words that occur in only a few documents and are thus more u'\u005cu201c' rich in content u'\u005cu201d'
p5
aVWe encounter the burstiness property of words again by looking at unigram occurrence probabilities
p6
aVAs it turns out this u'\u005cu2018' burstiness u'\u005cu2019' of words within
