VLexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning
p1
aVTable 4 shows examples where the translation predicted by response-based learning ( Rebol ) differs from the gold standard reference translation, but yet leads to positive feedback via a parse that returns the correct answer from the database
p2
aVInstead of and in addition to learning from human reference translations, response-based learning allows to convert multiple system translations into references
p3
aVTable 5 shows examples where translations from Rebol and Rampion differ from the gold standard reference, and predictions by Rebol lead to positive feedback, while predictions by Rampion lead to negative feedback
p4
aVTable 6 shows examples where translations from Rampion outperform translations from Rebol in terms of task feedback
p5
aVIn case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update
p6
aVBuilding on prior
