<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To fix the negative impact on query aspects, we could leverage the findings in the previous study [ 28 ] and regularize the weighting strategy based on the length of query aspects to favor documents covering more query aspects</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al proposed a task-specific representation, i.e.,, using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion method based on the relationships among the medical concepts [ 12 , 13 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In a way, the constraint aims to counteract the arbitrary statistics inflation caused by MetaMap results and balance the weight among concepts based on the importance of the associated query aspects</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In particular, our preliminary results show that turning on the disambiguation functionality provided by MetaMap (i.e.,, returning only the most likely concept for each query) could lead to worse retrieval performance than using all the candidate mappings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>With the increasing use of electronic health records, it becomes urgent to leverage this rich information resource about patients u'\u2019' health conditions to transform research in health and medicine</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Under such a situation, traditional retrieval functions would likely work well and generate satisfying retrieval performance since the relations among concepts are independent which is consistent with the assumptions made in traditional IR [ 18 ]</a>
