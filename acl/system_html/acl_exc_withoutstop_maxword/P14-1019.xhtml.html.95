<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees</a>
