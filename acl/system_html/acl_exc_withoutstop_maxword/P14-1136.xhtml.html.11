<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We denote the frames that associate with u'\u2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u2113'</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We used the same test set as Das et al containing 23 documents with 4,458 predicates</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The mapping from g u'\u2062' ( x ) to the low dimensional space u'\u211d' m is a linear transformation, so the model parameters to be learnt are the matrix M u'\u2208' u'\u211d' n u'\u2062' k m as well as the embedding of each possible frame label, represented as another matrix Y u'\u2208' u'\u211d' F m where there are F frames in total</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Subsequently, we learn a mapping from this initial</a>
