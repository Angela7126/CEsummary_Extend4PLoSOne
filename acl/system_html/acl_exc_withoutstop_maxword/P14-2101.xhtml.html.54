<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on the observation that a short summary of a collection of documents can serve as a label characterising the collection, we propose to generate topic label candidates based on the summarisation of a topic u'\u2019' s relevant documents</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>[ 15 ] proposed to label topics by selecting top- n terms to label the overall topic based on different ranking mechanisms including pointwise mutual information and conditional probabilities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These TT set corresponds to the top x terms ranked based on the probability of the word given the topic ( p ( w k ) ) from the topic model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The most generic approach to automatic labelling has been to use as primitive labels the top- n words in a topic distribution learned by a topic model such as LDA [ 9 , 2 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, following a similarity alignment approach we performed the steps oulined in Algorithm 3.2 for generating the GS topic labels of a topic in TW</a>
