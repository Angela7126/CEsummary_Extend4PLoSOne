<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Three of the data sets are dependency treebanks (NDT, CDT, PCEDT) and one phrase structure treebank (SSD), and of the dependency treebanks the PCEDT contains semantic dependencies, while the other two have traditional syntactic dependencies</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The only work we know of using chance-corrected metrics is \citeN Rag:Dic13, who use MASI [] to measure agreement on dependency relations and head selection in multi-headed dependency syntax, and \citeN Bha:Sha12, who compute Cohen u'\u2019' s u'\u039a' [] on dependency relations in single-headed dependency syntax</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For large data sets such as the PCEDT set used in this work, computing u'\u0391' with tree edit distance as the distance measure can take a very long time</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, most evaluations of syntactic treebanks use simple accuracy measures such as bracket F 1 scores for constituent trees (NEGRA, [] ; TIGER, [] ; Cat3LB, [] ; The Arabic Treebank, [] ) or labelled or unlabelled attachment scores for dependency syntax (PDT, [] ; PCEDT [] ; Norwegian Dependency Treebank, []</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The data studied in this work has previously been used by \citeN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In our evaluation, we will contrast labelled accuracy, the standard parser evaluation metric, and our three u'\u0391' metrics</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 3 , with the labelled attachment score 6 6 The de facto standard parser evaluation metric in dependency parsing the percentage of tokens that receive the correct head and dependency relation</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In particular, we are interested in the correlation (or lack thereof) between LAS and the alphas, and whether the results of our synthetic experiments correspond well with the results on real-world IAA sets</a>
