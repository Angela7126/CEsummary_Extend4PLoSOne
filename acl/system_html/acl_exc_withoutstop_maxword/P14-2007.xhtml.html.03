<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using the idea of u'\u201c' annotation time u'\u201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our proposed metric measures complexity of sentiment annotation, as perceived by human annotators</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this section, we describe how complexity may be introduced in sentiment annotation in different classical layers of NLP</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To the best of our knowledge, there is no general approach to u'\u201c' measure u'\u201d' how complex a piece of text is, in terms of sentiment annotation</a>
