<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It may be thought that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) provides implicit annotation the higher the agreement, the easier the piece of text is for sentiment annotation</a>
