<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the structural similarity component (Figure 1 (b), bottom), the semantic signature for each concept c i is computed by running the ppr algorithm on its corresponding graph G i , hence a different u'\ud835' u'\udc0c' i is built for each of the two concepts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Here, we describe how the four semantic graphs for our four lexical resources (i.e.,, wn , wp , wt , ow ) were constructed</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The other two resources, i.e.,, wt and ow , do not provide a reliable network of semantic relations, therefore we used our ontologization approach to construct their corresponding semantic graphs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we assume that a lexical resource L can be represented as an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) where V is the set of nodes, i.e.,, the concepts defined in</a>
