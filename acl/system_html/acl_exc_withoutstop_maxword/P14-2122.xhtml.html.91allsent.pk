VThe experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus
p1
aVThese variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS
p2
aVTherefore, we have not explored VB methods in this paper, but we do show that our method is superior to the existing methods
p3
aVWe aware that variational bayes (VB) may be used for speeding up the training of DP-based or PYP-based bilingual UWS
p4
aVThis is because this corpus is out-of-domain for the supervised segmenters
p5
aVUWS learns models by maximizing the likelihood of the unsegmented corpus, formulated as
p6
aVUWS learns from unsegmented raw text, which are available in large quantities, and thus it has the potential to provide more accurate and adaptive segmentation than supervised approaches with less development effort being required
p7
aVThe proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested
p8
aV[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data
p9
aVThe data sets of NIST Eval 2002 to 2005 were used as the development for MERT tuning []
p10
aVThe monolingual expectation is calculated according to Eq
p11
aVThis data set mainly consists of news text 3 3 It also contains a small number of web blogs
p12
aVThe monolingual bigram model, however, was slower to converge, so we started it from the segmentations of the unigram model, and using 10 iterations
p13
aVFor the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than that of the monolingual unigram model, as the states at specific position of F are not only related to the length of the current word, but also related to the length of the word before it
p14
aVThus its complexity is U 2 times the unigram model u'\u005cu2019' s complexity
p15
aVMany languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT
p16
aVThe set u'\u005cu2131' is chosen to represent an unsegmented foreign language sentence (a sequence of characters), because an unsegmented sentence can be seen as the set of all possible segmentations of the sentence denoted F , i.e., F u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu2131'
p17
aVNote that the comparison of speed is only for reference because the times are obtained from their respective papers
p18
aVP ( u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2131' , u'\u005cu2133' ) is the marginal probability of all the possible F u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu2131' that contain u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' as a word, which can be calculated efficiently through dynamic programming (the process is similar to the foreward-backward algorithm in training a hidden Markov model (HMM) []
p19
aV7 can be rewritten (as in IBM model 2
p20
aVwhere K is the number of characters in u'\u005cu2131' , and the k -th character is the start of the word f j , since j and J are unknown during the computation of dynamic programming u'\u005cu0394' b is the window size, u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu03a6' is the prior probability of an empty English word, and u'\u005cu03a3' ensures all the items sum to 1
p21
aVP ( u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' u'\u005cu2131' , E , u'\u005cu212c' ) is the marginal probability of all the possible F u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu2131' that contain u'\u005cu2131' k k u'\u005cu2032' as a word and are aligned with E , formulated as
p22
aVIn order to maintain both speed and accuracy, the following window function is adopted
p23
aVFor UWS, the hidden variables are indicators that identify substrings of sentences in the corpus as words
p24
aVIn monolingual segmentation, the proposed methods with both unigram and bigram models were tested
p25
aVIt was set to 3 for the monolingual unigram model, and 2 for the bilingual unigram model, which provided slightly higher BLEU scores on the development set than the other settings
p26
aVThe training set consists of 1 million parallel sentences extracted from patent documents, and the development set and test set both consist of 2000 sentences
p27
aVWe removed the United Nations corpus and the traditional Chinese data sets from the constraint training resources
p28
aVThe bilingual model is
p29
aVCHILDES [] is the most common test corpus for UWS methods
p30
aVThe first bilingual corpus
p31
aVstate-of-the-art accuracy in monolingual UWS;
p32
aVHowever, bilingual approaches that model word probabilities suffer from computational complexity
p33
aVTo this end, we model bilingual UWS under a similar framework with monolingual UWS in order to improve efficiency, and replace Gibbs sampling with expectation maximization (EM) in training
p34
aVthe first bilingual UWS method practical for large corpora;
p35
aVThe monolingual model u'\u005cu2133' is
p36
aVThis section describes our unified monolingual and bilingual UWS scheme
p37
aVTable 5 presents the run times of the proposed methods on the bilingual corpora
p38
aVThe computational complexity of our method is linear in the number of iterations, the size of the corpus, and the complexity of calculating the expectations on each sentence or sentence pair
p39
aVHowever, VB requires formulating the m expectations of ( m - 1 ) -dimensional marginal distributions, where m is the number of hidden variables
p40
aVThe time cost of the bilingual models is about 5 times that of the monolingual model, which is consistent with the complexity analysis in Section 3
p41
aVFor bilingual segmentation,the size of the alignment window is set to 6 ; the probability u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu03a6' of foreign language words being generated by an empty English word, was set to 0.3

p43
aVimprovement of BLEU scores compared to supervised Stanford Chinese word segmenter
p44
aVIn practical applications, the size of the corpus is fixed, and we found empirically that the number of iterations required by the proposed method for convergence is usually small (less than five iterations
p45
aVCharacter-based segmentation, LDC segmenter and Stanford Chinese segmenters were used as the baseline methods
p46
aVThe approaches of explicitly modeling the probability of words [] significantly outperformed a heuristic approach [] on the monolingual Chinese SIGHAN-MSR corpus [] , which inspired the work of this paper
p47
aVThe bilingual expectation is given by Eq
p48
aV5 ; the complexity is linear in the length of sentences and the square of the predefined maximum length of words
p49
aVTable 4 presents the BLEU scores for Moses using different segmentation methods

aVThis paper is dedicated to bilingual UWS on large-scale corpora to support SMT
p52
aVThe maximum length of foreign language words is set to 4
p53
aV[] used the local best alignment to increase the speed of the Gibbs sampling in training but the impact on accuracy was not explored
p54
aVExperimental results show that they are competitive to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and speed (Table LABEL:tab:mono:acc
p55
aVPatentMT9 is from the shared task of NTCIR-9 patent machine translation
p56
aVThe CTB and PKU Stanford segmenter were both trained on annotated news text, which was the major domain of OpenMT06
p57
aVThe training was started from assuming that there was no previous segmentations on each sentence (pair), and the number of iterations was fixed
p58
aVThen, the previous dynamic programming method can be extended to the bilingual expectation
p59
aVFor example, in machine translation, there are various parallel corpora such as BTEC for tourism-related dialogues [] and PatentMT in the patent domain [] 1 1 http://ntcir.nii.ac.jp/PatentMT , but researchers working on Chinese-related tasks often use the Stanford Chinese segmenter [] which is trained on a small amount of annotated news text
p60
aVMonolingual and bilingual WS can be formulated as follows, respectively

p63
aVIn this section, the proposed method is first validated on monolingual segmentation tasks, and then evaluated in the context of SMT to study whether the translation quality, measured by BLEU, can be improved
p64
aVThis section uses a unigram model for description convenience, but the method can be extended to n -gram models
p65
aVTwo monolingual corpora and two bilingual corpora are used (Table 2
p66
aVInspired by [] , we employ a Pitman-Yor process model to build the segmentation model u'\u005cu2133' or u'\u005cu212c'
p67
aVIn contrast, UWS, spurred by the findings that infants are able to use statistical cues to determine word boundaries [] , relies on statistical criteria instead of manually crafted standards

p74
aVThe results reported in related papers are listed for comparison
p75
aVThough supervised-learning approaches which involve training segmenters on manually segmented corpora are widely used [] , yet the criteria for manually annotating words are arbitrary, and the available annotated corpora are limited in both quantity and genre variety
