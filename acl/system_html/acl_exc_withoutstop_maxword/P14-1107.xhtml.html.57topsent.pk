aVThe Turker graph, G T , is an undirected graph whose edges represent u'\u005cu201c' collaboration u'\u005cu201d' Formally, let t i and t j be two translator/editor pairs; we say that pair t i u'\u005cu201c' collaborates with u'\u005cu201d' pair t j (and therefore, there is an edge between t i and t j ) if t i and t j share either a translator or an editor (or share both a translator and an editor
