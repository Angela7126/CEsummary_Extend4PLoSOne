<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is similar to direct transfer in that we also use a shared feature representation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That includes approaches such as direct model transfer [] and annotation projection []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Direct model transfer attempts to find a shared feature representation for samples from the two languages, usually generalizing and abstracting away from language-specific representations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, a certain preposition attached to a token in the source language might map into a morphological tag in the target language, which would be hard to handle for traditional direct model transfer other than using some</a>
