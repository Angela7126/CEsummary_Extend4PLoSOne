VFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p1
aVHowever, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the skeleton of the input tree/sentence or other not-so-important sub-structures
p2
aVHowever, using different skeleton identification results for training and inference (row 3) does not show big improvements due to the data inconsistency problem
p3
aVWe chose the default feature set of the NiuTrans.Phrase engine for building the baseline, including phrase translation probabilities, lexical weights, a 5-gram language model, word and phrase bonuses, a ME-based lexicalized reordering model
p4
aVThus the problem is in principle the same as sentence simplification/compression
p5
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p6
aVThen we define skeleton-based translation as a task of searching for the best target string t ^ given the source string and its skeleton u'\u005cu03a4'
p7
aVObviously the skeleton used in this work can be viewed as a simplified sentence
p8
aVCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p9
aVE.g., one may introduce syntactic features into g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) due to their good ability in capturing structural information; and employ a standard phrase-based model for g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) in which not all segments of the sentence need to respect syntactic constraints
p10
aVAs is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is used to assign a model score to each derivation
p11
aVIn contrast, we define sentence skeleton as the key segments of a sentence and develop a new MT approach based on this information
p12
aVA derivation d is skeleton-consistent if no phrases in d cross skeleton boundaries (e.g.,, a phrase where two of the source words are in the skeleton and one is outside
p13
aVThere are some previous studies on the use of sentence skeleton or related information in MT [ Mellebeek et al.2006a , Mellebeek et al.2006b , Owczarzak et al.2006 ]
p14
aVThese results indicate that the real improvements are due to the skeleton-based model/features used in this work, rather than the u'\u005cu201d' well-formed u'\u005cu201d' derivations
p15
aVFor our skeletal language model, we trained a 5-gram language model on the target-side of the bilingual data by generalizing non-skeleton segments to Xs
p16
aVThe simplest of these is the phrase-based approach [ Och et al.1999 , Koehn et al.2003 ] which employs a global model to process any sub-strings of the input sentence
p17
aVFor comparison, we also manually annotated the MT development and test data with skeleton information according to the annotation standard provided within NEUCSS
p18
aVSeen from row s-feat., this feature does not show promising improvements
p19
aVWe used the NEU Chinese sentence simplification (NEUCSS) corpus as our training data [ Zhang et al.2013 ]
p20
aVDue to the lack of space, we do not go deep into this problem
p21
aVThen, we can simply define g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) as the model scores of d u'\u005cu03a4' and d
p22
aVHere we choose a simple and straightforward method a skeleton is obtained by dropping all unimportant words in the original sentence, while preserving the grammaticality
p23
aVFurther, we regarded skeleton-consistent derivations as an indicator feature and introduced it into the baseline system
p24
aVThe motivations of defining the problem in this way are two-fold
p25
aVWe used the newswire portion of the NIST MT06 evaluation data as our development set, and used the evaluation data of MT04 and MT05 as our test sets
p26
aVSome of them developed syntax-based models on complete syntactic trees with Treebank annotations [ Liu et al.2006 , Huang et al.2006 , Zhang et al.2008 ] , and others used source-language syntax as soft constraints [ Marton and Resnik2008 , Chiang2010 ]
