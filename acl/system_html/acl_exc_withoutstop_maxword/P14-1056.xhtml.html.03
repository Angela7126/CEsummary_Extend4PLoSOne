<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>MAP inference in the model with soft constraints is performed using Soft-DD, shown in Algorithm 3</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These are same global constraints that were used for citation field extraction in Chang et al</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The global constraints added into the model are simply that each label only occurs once per citation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We now describe the families of global constraints we consider for citation extraction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Pairwise constraints are constraints on the counts of two labels in a citation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this case, the MAP problem can be formulated as a structured linear model similar to equation ( 1 ), for which we have a MAP algorithm, but where we have imposed some additional constraints A u'\u2062' y u'\u2264' b that no longer allow us to use the algorithm</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Initial work in machine learning for citation extraction used Markov models with no global constraints</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using our new method, we are able to incorporate not only all the soft global constraints of Chang et al</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Singleton constraints ensure that each label can appear at most once in a citation</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We consider all constraints of the forms z u'\u2062' ( i , j ) u'\u2264' 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and z u'\u2062' ( i , j ) u'\u2265' 0</a>
