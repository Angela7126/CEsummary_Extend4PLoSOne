VOur parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects
p1
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' Replaced u'\u005cu201d' system modifies the Berkeley parser by replacing rare words with morphological descriptors of those words computed using language-specific modules, which have been hand-crafted for individual languages or are trained with additional annotation layers in the treebanks that we do not exploit
p2
aVBy annotating grammar nonterminals with their headwords, the idea is to better model phenomena that depend heavily on the semantics of the words involved, such as coordination and PP attachment
p3
aVFigure 3 shows an example of one instance of this feature template impact is a noun that is more likely to take a PP than other nouns, and so we expect this feature to have high weight and encourage the attachment; this feature proves generally useful in resolving such cases of right-attachments to noun phrases, since the last word of the noun phrase is often the head
p4
aVThe underlying reason that such propagation is even needed is that PCFG parsers score trees based on local configurations only, and any information that is not threaded through the
