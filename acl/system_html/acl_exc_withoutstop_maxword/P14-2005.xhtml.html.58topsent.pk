aVThe BLANC-gold metric was developed with the assumption that response mentions and key mentions are identical

aVHowever, when response mentions are not identical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) cannot be applied directly to systems with imperfect mentions
