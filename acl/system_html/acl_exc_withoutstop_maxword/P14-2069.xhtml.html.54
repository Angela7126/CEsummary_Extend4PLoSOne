<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our approach is a weakly supervised approach since only some seeds emotion sentiment words are needed to lanch the process of lexicon construction</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The proposed EaLDA model extends the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ] model by employing a small set of seeds to guide the model generating topics</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The experimental results show that our algorithm can successfully construct a fine-grained domain-specific emotion lexicon for this corpus that is able to understand the connotation of the words that may not be obvious without the context</a>
