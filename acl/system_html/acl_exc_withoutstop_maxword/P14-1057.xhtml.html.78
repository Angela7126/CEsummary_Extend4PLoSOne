<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a result, directly applying existing weighting strategies might lead to non-optimal retrieval performance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect u'\u201c' children u'\u201d' is mapped to 2 concepts while u'\u201c' dental caries u'\u201d' is mapped to 3 concepts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al proposed a task-specific representation, i.e.,, using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion method based on the relationships among the medical concepts [ 12 , 13 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Existing studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores as the relevance score of a visit [ 15 , 30 ,</a>
