<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The combination strategy is to simply merge all positive results from the two methods together, and then to infer new relations based on the transitivity of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The result shows that only a small part of the hypernyms can be extracted based on these patterns because only a few hypernym relations are expressed in these fixed patterns, and many are expressed in highly flexible manners</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>
