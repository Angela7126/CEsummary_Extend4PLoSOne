VThe structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic structure of those networks
p1
aVInstead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures
p2
aVHowever, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm
p3
aVOur ontologization algorithm takes as input a lexicon L and outputs a semantic graph G = ( V , E ) where, as already defined in Section 2 , V is the set of concepts in L and E is the set of semantic relations between these concepts
