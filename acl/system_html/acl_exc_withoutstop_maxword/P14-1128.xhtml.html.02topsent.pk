VCrucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u005cu2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]

aVSelf-training Segmenters (STS two variant models were defined by the approach reported in [ 20 ] that uses the supervised CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s decodings, incorporating empirical and constraint information, for unlabeled examples as additional labeled data to retrain a CRFs model

aVThis paper proposes an alternative Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) model adapted to the SMT task, which seeks not only to maintain the advantages of a monolingual supervised model, having hand-annotated linguistic knowledge, but also to assimilate the relevant bilingual segmentation nature
