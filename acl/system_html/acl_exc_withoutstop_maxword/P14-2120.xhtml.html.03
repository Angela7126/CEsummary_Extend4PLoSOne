<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Consequently, we define the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships, with illustrating examples in Table 1 , as follows</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u201c' derailment of train u'\u201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u201c' crash of train u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>On the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>While they are not connected syntactically, each of them often has an explicit relationships with other terms in the text, that might support the sought (implied) relationship between a and p</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in</a>
