V[] also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction
p1
aVBased on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction
p2
aVThe soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u005cu201c' soft constraint u'\u005cu201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions
p3
aVBecause the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed
p4
aVUnlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature
p5
aVIn consideration of the Chinese characteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features
p6
aVBecause we are interested in the 6 annotated major relation types and the 18 subtypes, we average the results of five runs on the 6 positive relation types (and 18 subtypes) as the final performance
p7
aVDeleting of relation instances is acceptable for
