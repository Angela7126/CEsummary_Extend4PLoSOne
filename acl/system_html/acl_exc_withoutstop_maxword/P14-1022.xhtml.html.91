<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Subsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u2062' ( r</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, we augment our existing model with standard sentiment analysis features that look at unigrams and bigrams in the span [ 31 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the (deterministic) tag for each word as its descriptor</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluated our model on the fine-grained sentiment analysis task presented in Socher et al</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The grammar rule 2 u'\u2192' 4 1 already encodes the notion of the sentiment of the right child being dominant, so</a>
