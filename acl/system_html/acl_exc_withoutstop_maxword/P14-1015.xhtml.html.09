<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since the language and translation models operate at the word level, the objective function entails that we let the models learn based on their fractional contribution of the words from the language and translation models</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We model the lexical correlation and solution post character using regularized translation models and unigram language models respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The IBM Model 1 learning process uses an internal EM approach where the E-step estimates the alignment vector for each problem word; this vector indicates the distribution of alignments of the problem word across the solution words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We will use translation and language models in our method for solution identification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Consider a unigram language model u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S that models the lexical characteristics of solution posts, and a translation model u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S that models the lexical correlation between problems and solutions</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>At the end of the iterations, the pairs labeled S are output as solution pairs</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We use the labels and reply-word source estimates from the E-step to re-learn the language and translation models in this step</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We let each reply word contribute as much to the respective language and translation models according to the estimates in Section 4.3.2</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In short, our approach is a 2-way clustering algorithm that uses two pairs of models, [ u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S ] and [</a>
