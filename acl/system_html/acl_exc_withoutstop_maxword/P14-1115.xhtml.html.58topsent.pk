VAs a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]
p1
aVThis means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content
p2
aVAbstractive summary sentences can be created by aggregating and merging multiple sentences into an abstract sentence
p3
aVFor meeting dataset, the percentage of completely grammatical sentences drops dramatically
p4
aVTo estimate the utterance score, we view both the query terms and the signature terms as the terms that should appear in a human query-based summary
p5
aVThe LexRank baseline improves the results of the TextRank system by increasing the precision and balancing the precision and recall scores for ROUGE-1 score
p6
aVIn our pipeline we aim at higher recall, since we later filter sentences and aggregate them to generate new abstract sentences
p7
aVExample 1 shows two queries and their associated human written summaries based on a single chat log
p8
aVIn this way, the title of each summary can be counted as a phrasal query and the corresponding summary is considered as the query-based abstract of the associated chat log including only the information most relevant to the title
p9
aVMoreover, we compare our abstractive system with the first part of our framework (utterance extraction in Figure 1), which can be presented as an extractive query-based summarization system (our extractive system
p10
aVIn this section, we show the evaluation results of our proposed framework and its comparison to the baselines and a state-of-the-art query-focused extractive summarization system
p11
aVIn other words, using our extractive model described in section 2.1, as a stand alone system, is an effective query-based extractive summarization model
p12
aV2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality
