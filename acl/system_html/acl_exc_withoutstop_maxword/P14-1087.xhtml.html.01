<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u2062' S c</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We hypothesize that when more events happen within a particular time span, that time span is potentially more relevant for summarization</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Sentences that mention events found in such a time span should be assigned higher scores</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This corresponds to the number of time spans that the events in a sentence talk about</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In Figure 4 , taking reference from event e (shaded in black), the left peak to the time span which e is in happens to be time span A , while the right peak is time span A + 4</a>
