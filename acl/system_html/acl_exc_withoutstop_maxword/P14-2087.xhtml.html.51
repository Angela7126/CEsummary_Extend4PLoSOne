<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By using only glosses, the proposed model already shows statistically significant improvement over the basic Lesk algorithm (92.4% and 140.5% relative improvement in Senseval-2 coarse- and fine-grained tracks, respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods</a>
