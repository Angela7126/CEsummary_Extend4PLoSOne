<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An edit-turn-pair is defined as a pair of an edit from a Wikipedia article u'\u2019' s revision history and a turn from the discussion page bound to the same article</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article u'\u2019' s discussion page</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, given the high price for a new corresponding edit-turn-pair (due to the high class imbalance in random data), we consider it as a useful starting point for research on edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual edit</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If an article has no discussion page, there are no edit-turn-pairs for this article</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To assess the reliability of these annotations, one of the co-authors manually annotated a random subset of 100 edit-turn-pairs contained in ETP-gold as corresponding or non-corresponding</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Roughly five hours after that turn was issued on</a>
