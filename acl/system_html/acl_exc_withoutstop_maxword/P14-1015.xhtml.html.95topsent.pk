VA variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification
p1
aVAll solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts
p2
aVThe common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification
p3
aV[ 3 ] ), we label the pairs that have the the reply from the second post (note that the first post is assumed to be the problem post) in the thread as a solution post, and all others as non-solution posts
p4
aVTypical response posts include solutions or clarification requests, whereas feedback posts form another major category of forum posts
p5
aV[ 3 ] reports a study that illustrates that non-solution posts are, on an average, as similar to the problem as solution posts in technical forums
p6
aVBeing supervised methods, the above assumptions are implicitly factored in by including the appropriate feature (e.g.,, post position in thread) in the feature space so that the learner may learn the correlation (e.g.,,
