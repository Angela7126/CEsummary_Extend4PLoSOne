<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Each sentence was annotated on a scale from 1 to 4 as described below, with 4 being the most grammatical</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given each sentence, the model obtains the counts of n -grams ( n = 1 u'\u2062' u'\u2026' u'\u2062' 3 ) from English Gigaword and computes the following features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The system was designed for use with a dataset consisting of 50% grammatical and 50% ungrammatical sentences, rather than data with ordinal or continuous labels</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Evaluating on a binary scale allows us to measure how well the system distinguishes grammatical sentences from ungrammatical ones</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Every sentence judged on the 1 u'\u2013' 4 scale must be a clause</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>72 sentences are labeled 1; 538 are 2; 1,431 are 3; 978 are 4; and 110 are u'\u201c' O u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We report performance in terms of Pearson u'\u2019' s r between the averaged 1 u'\u2013' 4 human labels and unrounded system predictions</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality</a>
