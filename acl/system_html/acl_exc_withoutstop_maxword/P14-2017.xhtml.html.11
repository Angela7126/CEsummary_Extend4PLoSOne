<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Algorithms for string alignment were successfully used for identifying cognates based on both their forms, orthographic and phonetic</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Its main idea is that any partial path of the alignment along the optimal path should be the optimal path leading up to that point</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As for the length of the grams, we experiment with n u'\u2208' { 1 , 2 , 3 }</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using aligned pairs of words as input, we extract features around mismatches in the alignments</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, for the above-mentioned pair of cognates, (exhaustiv, esaustivo) , we extract the following features when n = 2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Because we need sets of approximately equal size for comparison across languages, we keep 400 pairs of cognates and 400 pairs of non-cognates for each pair of languages</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The wide range of applications in which cognates prove useful attracted more and more attention on methods for detecting such related pairs of words</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Therefore, the research [ 17 , 25 , 16 ] focused on automatic identification of cognate pairs, starting from lists of known cognates</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of</a>
