<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u2019' s score; r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' g b - a is defined similarly and again we consider as features the min, max and log-product of these ranks</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An important aspect is thus to guarantee that there is a correlation between the similarity score (Lin u'\u2019' s score here), and the evaluated relevance of the neighbour pairs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>each neighbour productivity p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d a and p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d b are defined as the numbers of neighbours of respectively neighbour a and neighbour b in the database (thus related tokens with a similarity above the threshold), from which we derive three features as for frequencies the min, the max, and the log of the product</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u201c' existential u'\u201d' view of semantic relatedness</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This can be considered as a baseline for extraction of relevant lexical pairs, to which we turn in the following section</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database</a>
