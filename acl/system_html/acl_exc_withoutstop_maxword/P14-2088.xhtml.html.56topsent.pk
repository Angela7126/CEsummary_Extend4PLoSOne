VThen we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features
p1
aVWhile the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising autoencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features
p2
aVAs we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces
p3
aVFor each feature template, there are thousands of binary features
p4
aV2012 ) showed that such autoencoders can be learned even as the noising process is analytically marginalized; the idea is similar in spirit
