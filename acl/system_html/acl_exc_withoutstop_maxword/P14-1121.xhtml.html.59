<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [ breast cancer corpus 1 ] , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [ diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14 ] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which</a>
