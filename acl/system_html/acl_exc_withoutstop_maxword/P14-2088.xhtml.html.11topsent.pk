VAs a secondary contribution of this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of unsupervised domain adaptation to the syntactic analysis of historical texts
p1
aVConsequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing [ 25 ]
p2
aVAssume instances u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' n , which are drawn from both the source and target domains
p3
aVWe obtain a projection matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' s for each subset by reconstructing the pivot features from the features in this subset; we can then use the sum of all reconstructions as the new features, tanh u'\u005cu2061' (
