<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Third, we note that both video games in the paid setting incur a fixed cost (for the prizes) and therefore additional games played can only further decrease the cost per annotation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These mechanics ensure the game naturally produces better quality annotations; in contrast, common crowdsourcing platforms do not support analogous mechanics for enforcing this type of correctness at</a>
