(lp0
VHowever, as described in Section 1 , our event causality criteria are different; since they regarded phrase pairs that were not self-contained as event causality (their annotators checked the original sentences of phrase pairs to see if they were event causality), their judgments tended to be more lenient than ours, which explains the performance difference
p1
aVWe observed that CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p and CEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s performed poorly and tended to favor event causality candidates whose phrase pairs were highly relevant to each other but described the contrasts of events rather than event causality (e.g., build a slow muscle and build a fast muscle ) probably because their main components are PMI values
p2
aVOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p3
aVAfter applying additional filters (see Section LABEL:A-sec:filtering-conditions in the supplementary notes) including those based on a stop-word list and a causal connective list to remove unlikely event causality candidates that are not removed by the above filter, we finally acquired 2,451,254 event causality candidates
p4
aVScenarios ( s u'\u005cu2062' c s) generated by chaining causally-compatible phrase pairs are scored by S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c ) , which embodies our assumption that an acceptable scenario consists of plausible event causality pairs
p5
aVThe samples were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who were instructed to regard a sample as acceptable if each event causality that constitutes it is plausible and the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent story
p6
aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
p7
aVFor the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u005cu27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u005cu27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1
p8
aVAn original sentence filter removes a scenario if two event causality pairs that are chained in it are extracted from original sentences between which no word overlap exists other than words constituting causality pairs
p9
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p10
aVNext we describe our experiments on event causality extraction and show (a) that most of our features are effective and (b) that our method outperforms the baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ]
p11
aVNote that means can be seen as u'\u005cu201c' causing u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' realizing u'\u005cu201d' the purpose of using the means in this relation, and actually event causality can be obtained by incorporating noun pairs of this relation into template pairs like activate A u'\u005cu2192' conduct B
p12
aVWe require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted
p13
aVWe extracted 557 social problem nouns and used the cause phrases of the event causality candidates that consisted of one of the social problem nouns as the scenario u'\u005cu2019' s beginning event
p14
aVWe also require the predicate of the cause phrase to syntactically depend on the effect phrase in the sentence from which the event causality was extracted; we guarantee this by verifying the dependencies of the original sentence
p15
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method
p16
aVWe applied our event causality extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Section 3.1 ) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs from them (See Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-event-causality in the supplementary notes for examples
p17
aVOur evaluation is based on average precision ; 9 9 It is obtained by computing the precision for each point in the ranked list where we find a positive sample and averaging all the precision figures [ 18 ] we believe that it is important to rank the plausible event causality candidates higher
p18
aVThis is important since future scenarios, which are generated by chaining event causality as described below, must be self-contained, unlike Hashimoto et al
p19
aVBase features represent the basic properties of event causality like nouns, templates, and their excitation polarities (See Section LABEL:A-sec:base-features in the supplementary notes
p20
aVAccordingly, we generated a scenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus that was crawled in 2007, but the vibrio risk due to global warming has actually been observed in the Baltic sea and reported in Baker-Austin et al
p21
aVWe developed features that capture the characteristics of likely contexts for Japanese event causality (See Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features in the supplementary notes
p22
aVFirst, we assume that two nouns (e.g., slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification ) that take some specific binary semantic relations (e.g., A causes B ) tend to constitute event causality if combined with two predicates (e.g., conduct and exacerbate
p23
aVFor example, our method can identify the compatibility between sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise to chain global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus 2 2 A bacterium in the sea causing food-poisoning fouls (water
p24
aVOur method achieved 70% precision at 13% recall; we can extract about 69,700 event causality pairs with 70% precision, as described below
p25
aVSuch noun pairs mean event causality by substituting them into template pairs like omit A u'\u005cu2192' get B
p26
aV5 5 Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model [ 24 ]
p27
aVIndeed materials can participate in event causality with the help of such template pairs as A is stolen u'\u005cu2192' B is made as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p28
aVIts relation to event causality might seem unclear, but a material can be seen as a u'\u005cu201c' cause u'\u005cu201d' of a product
p29
aVOur future scenario generation method creates scenarios by chaining event causalities
p30
aVUsing the above features, a classifier 6 6 We used SVM l u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' t with the polynominal kernel ( d = 2 ), available at http://svmlight.joachims.org classifies each event causality candidate into causality and non-causality
p31
aVFor event causality extraction , clues used by previous methods can roughly be categorized as lexico-syntactic patterns [ 1 , 20 ] , words in context [ 19 ] , associations among words [ 28 , 22 , 8 ] , and predicate semantics [ 12 ]
p32
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1
p33
aVConsequently we conclude that not only semantic relations directly relevant to causality like Causation but also those that seem to lack direct relevance to causality like Material are somewhat effective
p34
aVFor example, global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) can be chained to constitute an acceptable scenario, but the joint part is not the same string
p35
aVDefinition-based features , as detailed in Section LABEL:A-sec:definition-based-association-features in the supplementary notes, resemble the Wikipedia-based features except that the information source is the definition sentences automatically acquired from our 600 million web pages using the method of Hashimoto et al
p36
aVA common argument filter removes a scenario if a joint part consists of two templates that share no argument in our u'\u005cu27e8' argument, template u'\u005cu27e9' database, which is compiled from the syntactic dependency data between arguments and templates extracted from our web corpus
p37
aVEach event causality candidate may be given multiple original sentences, since a phrase pair can appear in multiple sentences, in which case it is given more than one SVM score
p38
aVBesides features similar to those described above, we propose semantic relation features 3 3 Radinsky et al
p39
aVThey developed an automatic excitation template acquisition method that assigns each template an excitation value in range [ - 1 , 1 ] that is positive if the template is excitatory and negative if it is inhibitory
p40
aVTo this end, we propose a supervised method of extracting such event causality as conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification and use its output to generate future scenarios ( scenarios ), which are chains of causality that have been or might be observed in this world like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification u'\u005cu2192' increase Asian dust (from China) u'\u005cu2192' asthma gets worse
p41
aVThe estimated number is calculated as the product of the recall at 70% precision and the number of acceptable scenarios in all the generated scenarios, which is estimated by the annotated samples
p42
aVProposed , our scenario generation method without the two filters, Proposed+Orig , our method with the original sentence filter, Proposed+Orig+Comm , our method with the original sentence and common argument filters, and Exact , a method that chains event causality by exact matching
p43
aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s web information analysis system provides a what-happens-if QA service, which is based on our scenario generation method
p44
aVExperiments using 600 million web pages [ 2 ] show that our method outperforms baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ] by more than 19% of average precision
p45
aVNote that, for the diversity of the sampled scenarios, our sampling proceeded as follows i) Randomly sample a beginning event phrase from the generated scenarios ii) Randomly sample an effect phrase for the beginning event phrase from the scenarios iii) Regarding the effect phrase as a cause phrase, randomly sample an effect phrase for it, and repeat (iii) up to the specified number of steps (2 or 3
p46
aVCEA-based features are based on the Cause Effect Association (CEA) measure of Do et al
p47
aVOther clues include shared arguments [ 28 , 4 , 5 ] , which we ignore since we target event causality about two distinct entities
p48
aVMany phrase pairs described two events that often happen in parallel but are not event causality (e.g., reduce the intake of energy and increase the energy consumption ) in the highly ranked event causality candidates of Cs u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s and Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p
p49
aVThe baselines are not complete implementations of Do et al u'\u005cu2019' s method which uses discourse relations identified based on Lin et al
p50
aVIn preliminary experiments, since our proposed method u'\u005cu2019' s performance degraded when C u'\u005cu2062' s was incorporated, we did not use it in our method
p51
aVNext we compared our method with the baselines based on Hashimoto et al
p52
aVWe compared our method and two baselines based on Do et al
p53
aVCs u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses C u'\u005cu2062' s for ranking, and Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM with C u'\u005cu2062' s as the only feature that uses SVM scores for ranking
p54
aVThe performance was even worse when using no semantic relation ( u'\u005cu201c' None u'\u005cu201d' in Table 4
p55
aVNonetheless, we believe that this comparison is informative since CEA can be seen as the main component; they achieved a F1 of 41.7% for extracting causal event relations, but with only CEA they still achieved 38.6%
p56
aV2013 ) that observed the emerging vibrio risk in the Baltic sea due to global warming
p57
aVAs such, semantic relations like the Material relation can also be useful
p58
aVWe only keep the event causality candidates each phrase of which consists of excitation templates , which have been shown to be effective for causality extraction [ 12 ] and other semantic NLP tasks [ 19 ]
p59
aVThis is probably because scenario judgment requires careful consideration about various possible futures for which individual annotators tend to draw different conclusions
p60
aVExcitation is divided into six sub types based on the excitation polarity of the binary patterns, the argument positions, and the existence of causative markers
p61
aVThe semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus based on Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008
p62
aVThe curve is drawn in the same way as the precision-recall curve except that the X-axis indicates the estimated number of acceptable scenarios
p63
aVWe then estimated that, with the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality candidates, among which the estimated number of positive examples is 377,794
p64
aVThis relation is, so to speak, u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' since the entity denoted by the noun completing the A slot makes the entity denoted by the B noun NOT realized
p65
aVIndeed, both X rise and X are high are excitatory and hence sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise are causally-compatible
p66
aVAnnotators regarded as event causality only phrase pairs that were interpretable as event causality without contexts (i.e.,, self-contained
p67
aVIts average precision is different from that in Table 6 due to the difference in test data described above
p68
aVHowever, this approach would overlook many acceptable scenarios as discussed in Section 1
p69
aV\u005cUnderline CO2 levels rose, so \u005cUnderline climatic anomalies were observed , while an unlikely context would be
p70
aVFinally, Table 5 shows the performance drop by removing the Wikipedia-, definition-, web-, and CEA-based features
p71
aVProposed is the best and the CEA features slightly contribute to the performance, as Proposed-CEA indicates
p72
aVAccordingly, we estimate that we can generate 2,200 ( 50 , 000 × 22 500 ) acceptable and non-trivial scenarios from the top 50,000
p73
aVAlthough we have no definite answer yet, we name it the causal-compatibility of two phrases and provide its preliminary characterization based on the excitation polarity
p74
aVTwo phrases are causally-compatible if they mention the same entity (typically described by a noun) that is predicated by the templates of the same excitation polarity
p75
aVNote that, in this paper, A u'\u005cu2192' B denotes that A causes B , which means that u'\u005cu201c' if A happens, the probability of B increases u'\u005cu201d' Our notion of causality should be interpreted probabilistically rather than logically
p76
aVWe also checked whether an Wikipedia article whose title is a cause (effect) noun contains its effect (cause) noun, as detailed in Section LABEL:A-sec:wikipedia-based-association-features in the supplementary notes
p77
aVIt remains uncertain whether if \u005cUnderline the recession is bottomed \u005cUnderline the declining birth rate is halted
p78
aVWikipedia-based features are the co-occurrence counts and the PMI values between cause and effect nouns calculated using Wikipedia (as of 2013-Sep-19
p79
aVSince Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p performed slightly better when using all of the training data in our preliminary experiments, we used all of it
p80
aVOur ultimate goal is to develop a system that supports scenario planning through generating possible future events using big data, which would contain what Donald Rumsfeld called u'\u005cu201c' unknown unknowns u'\u005cu201d' 1 1 http://youtu.be/GiPe1OiKQuk [ 27 ]
p81
aVWe show that such thorough exploitation of new and existing features leads to high performance
p82
aVThe challenge is that many acceptable scenarios are overlooked if we require the joint part of the chain ( B above) to be an exact match
p83
aVThe world can be seen as a network of causality where people, organizations, and other kinds of entities causally depend on each other
p84
aVIn Japanese, since the temporal order between events is usually determined by precedence in a sentence, we require the cause phrase to precede the effect phrase
p85
aVFinal judgment was made by majority vote
p86
aVThis network is so huge and complex that it is almost impossible for humans to exhaustively predict the consequences of a given event
p87
aVTo increase the number of acceptable scenarios, our method identifies compatibility w.r.t causality between two phrases by a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation [ 12 ] , which properly relaxes the chaining condition (Section 3.1 describes it
p88
aVSuch semantic relations can be expressed by (otherwise unintuitive) patterns like A is an ingredient for B
p89
aVNoun pairs with this relation can constitute event causality when combined with template pairs like improve A u'\u005cu2192' cultivate B
p90
aVIn a nutshell, they represent a connective ( C1 and C2 in Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features ), the distance between the elements of event causality candidate ( C3 and C4 ), words in context ( C5 to C8 ), the existence of adnominal modifier ( 9 to C10 ), and the existence of additional arguments of cause and effect predicates ( C13 to C20 ), among others
p91
aVNote that semantic relations are not restricted to those directly relevant to causality like A causes B but can be those that might seem irrelevant to causality like A is an ingredient for B (e.g., plutonium and atomic bomb as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p92
aVUse is the relation between means (or instruments) and the purpose for using them
p93
aVFor example, omit toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' get a cavity is self-contained, but omit toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' get a girlfriend is not since this is not intelligible without a context
p94
aVOur underlying intuition is the observation that event causality tends to hold between two entities linked by semantic relations which roughly entail that one entity strongly affects the other
p95
aVWe omit Do et al u'\u005cu2019' s D u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t , which is a constant since we set our window size to one
p96
aVEach phrase in the event causality must consist of a predicate with an argument position ( template , hereafter) like conduct X and a noun like slash-and-burn agriculture that completes X
p97
aVAn event causality candidate is given a causality score C u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e , which is the SVM score (distance from the hyperplane) that is normalized to [ 0 , 1 ] by the sigmoid function 1 1 + e - x
p98
aVThen we check a noun pair (the nouns of the cause and effect phrases) for each event causality candidate, and give the candidate all the patterns in the database that co-occur with the noun pair
p99
aVBinary pattern of our semantic relations that co-occurs with two nouns of an event causality candidate in our web corpus
p100
aVTo favor the baselines for fairness, the event causality candidates of the development and test data were restricted to those with excitation values
p101
aVAs the beginning event of a scenario, we extracted nouns that describe social problems ( social problem nouns , e.g., deforestation ) from Wikipedia to focus our evaluation on the ability to generate scenarios about them, which is a realistic use-case of scenario generation
p102
aVThe experiments in Section 5.1.1 show that not only Causation and Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) but the other relations are also effective for event causality extraction
p103
aV2012 ) used semantic relations to generalize acquired causality instances that include those that are not obviously related to causality
p104
aVWeb-based association measures were obtained from the same database as AC4 in Table 2
p105
aVIn this case, the two event causality pairs tend to be about different topics and constitute an incoherent scenario
p106
aVSection 3.1 describes how to extract event causality candidates, and Section 3.2 details our features
p107
aVThis section describes our event causality extraction method
p108
aVSome phrase pairs have the same noun pairs and the same template polarity pairs (e.g., omit toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' get a cavity and neglect toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' have a cavity , where omit X and neglect X are inhibitory and get X and have X are excitatory
p109
aVWe hypothesize that two nouns with some particular semantic relations are more likely to constitute event causality
p110
aV22 among the 341 samples were non-trivial
p111
aVWe extract the event causality between two events represented by two phrases from single sentences that are dependency parsed
p112
aVBelow we describe the semantic relations that we believe are likely to constitute event causality
p113
aVFor context feature extraction, the event causality candidates are accompanied by the original sentences from which they were extracted
p114
aVWe applied the excitation filter to all 272,025,401 event causality candidates from the web and 132,528,706 remained
p115
aV× s 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the two phrases of event causality candidates, and s 1 and s 2 are the absolute excitation values of p 1 u'\u005cu2019' s and p 2 u'\u005cu2019' s templates
p116
aVFrom the training data, our method seemed to successfully learn what self-contained event causality is
p117
aVThese datasets were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who annotated the event causality candidates without looking at the original sentences
p118
aVSection 3.3 shows how to rank event causality candidates
p119
aVWe implement what we consider likely contexts for event causality as context features
p120
aVWe acquired 43,697 excitation templates by Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method and the manual annotation of excitation template candidates
p121
aVTo make event causality self-contained, we wrote guidelines for manually annotating training/development/test data
p122
aVWe removed such phrase pairs except those with the highest C u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e , and 960,561 phrase pairs remained, from which we generated two- or three-step scenarios that consisted of two or three phrase pairs
p123
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates in Section 3.1
p124
aVwhere C u'\u005cu2062' A u'\u005cu2062' U u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c ) is a set of event causality pairs that constitutes s u'\u005cu2062' c and c u'\u005cu2062' s is a member of C u'\u005cu2062' A u'\u005cu2062' U u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c
p125
aVFor effective decision making that carefully considers any form of future risks and chances, we need a system that helps humans do scenario planning [ 23 ] , which is a decision-making scheme that examines possible future events and assesses their potential chances and risks
p126
aVNeither involves chaining and restricts themselves to only one event causality step
p127
aVThey ranked event causality candidates by C u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1
p128
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates
p129
aVDo et al used it (along with discourse relations) to extract event causality
p130
aVThe last assumption embodied in our association features is that each word of the cause phrase must have a strong association (i.e.,, PMI, for example) with that of the effect phrase as slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification in the above example, as in Do et al
p131
aVIndeed, after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, few expected that it would lead to an enormous trade deficit in Japan due to a sharp increase in energy imports
p132
aVOur second assumption is that there are grammatical contexts in which event causality is more likely to appear
p133
aVOur experiments also show that we generated 50,000 scenarios with 68% precision, which include conduct terrorist operations u'\u005cu2192' terrorist bombing occurs u'\u005cu2192' cause fatalities and injuries u'\u005cu2192' cause economic losses and the above u'\u005cu201c' slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu201d' scenario (Section 5.2
p134
aVFor example, a likely context of event causality (underlined) would be
p135
aVTo show that our future scenario generation methods can generate many acceptable scenarios with reasonable precision, we experimentally compared four methods
p136
aVTable 3 shows the results of removing the semantic relation, the context, and the association features from our method
p137
aVOur method exploits these features on top of our base features such as nouns and predicates
p138
aV2011 ) generated semantic knowledge like causality that is written in no sentence
p139
aVThese features measure the association strength between slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification in conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification for instance and consist of CEA-, Wikipedia-, definition-, and web-based features
p140
aVNext we examined whether the semantic relations that do not seem directly relevant to causality like Material are effective
p141
aVWe simply add an additional argument position to each template in the 43,697 excitation templates to make binary patterns
p142
aVIn addition, we invented the \u005cUnderline Excitation relation that is expressed by binary patterns made of excitatory and inhibitory templates (Section 3.1
p143
aVHowever, their method cannot combine more than two pieces of knowledge unlike ours, and their target knowledge consists of nouns, but ours consists of verb phrases, which are more informative
p144
aVMoreover, for broader coverage, we acquired binary patterns that entail or are entailed by one of the patterns of the above six semantic relations
p145
aVIn a sense, we u'\u005cu201c' predicted u'\u005cu201d' an event observed in 2013 from documents written in 2007, although the scenario was ranked as low as 240,738th
p146
aVScenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) was generated by Proposed+Orig+Comm
p147
aVFor B3 and B4 , 500 semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus using the method of Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008 )
p148
aVFor instance, we make binary patterns A rises B and A lowers B from excitatory template rise X and inhibitory template lower X respectively
p149
aVBesides, the events they predict must be those for which similar events have previously been observed, and their method only applies to news domain
p150
aVExcitatory templates such as cause X entail that the function, effect, purpose or role of their argument u'\u005cu2019' s referent is activated, enhanced, or manifested, while inhibitory templates such as lower X entail that it is deactivated or suppressed
p151
aVUseful context information includes the mood of the sentences (e.g.,, the uncertainty mood expressed by uncertain above), which is represented by lexical features (Section 3.2.2
p152
aVthe performance degraded (46.27 u'\u005cu2192' 45.86) when we only used the Causation binary patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns compared to Proposed
p153
aVFleiss u'\u005cu2019' kappa of their judgments was 0.53 (moderate agreement), which is lower than the kappa for the causality judgment
p154
aVWeb-based features provide association measures between nouns using various window sizes in the 600 million web pages
p155
