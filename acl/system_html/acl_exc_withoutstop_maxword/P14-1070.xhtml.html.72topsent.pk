VIt contains projective dependency trees that were automatically derived from the latest status of the French Treebank [ 1 ] , which consists of constituency trees for sentences from the newspaper Le Monde , manually annotated with phrase structures, morphological information, and grammatical functional tags for dependents of verbs

aVThe MWE analyzer is a CRF-based sequential labeler, which, given a tokenized text, jointly performs MWE segmentation and POS tagging (of simple tokens and of MWEs), both tasks mutually helping each other 9 9 Note that in our experiments, we use this analyzer for MWE analysis only, and discard the POS tagging prediction

aVSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification
