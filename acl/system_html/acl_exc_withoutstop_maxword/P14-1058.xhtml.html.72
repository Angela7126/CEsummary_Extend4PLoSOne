<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Adding latent states to the smoothing model further improves the POS tagging accuracy [] propose a training set filtering method where they eliminate shorter words from the training data based on the intuition that longer words are more likely to be examples of productive linguistic processes than shorter words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Prior knowledge of the sentiment of words, such as sentiment lexicons, has been incorporated into cross-domain sentiment classification propose a joint sentiment-topic model that imposes a sentiment-prior depending on the occurrence of a word in a sentiment lexicon represent source and target domain reviews as nodes in a graph and apply a label propagation algorithm to predict the sentiment labels for target domain reviews from the sentiment labels in source domain reviews</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Consequently, a tagger trained on WSJ would incorrectly tag signal in MEDLINE append the source domain labeled data with predicted pivots (i.e., words that appear in both the source and target domains) to adapt a POS tagger to a target</a>
