<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Moreover, we compare our abstractive system with the first part of our framework (utterance extraction in Figure 1), which can be presented as an extractive query-based summarization system (our extractive system</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>1) To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first abstractive system that generates summaries based on users phrasal queries, instead of well-formed questions</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In other words, using our extractive model described in section 2.1, as a stand alone system, is an effective query-based extractive summarization model</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To address such limitations, we propose a fully automatic unsupervised abstract generation framework based on phrasal queries for multimodal conversation summarization</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Moreover, this step, stand alone, corresponds to an extractive summarization system</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>To achieve this, the most relevant (summary-worthy) utterances that we select are the ones that maximize the coverage of such terms</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In this section, we show the evaluation results of our proposed framework and its comparison to the baselines and a state-of-the-art query-focused extractive summarization system</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We use the extracted key-phrases as queries to generate query-based abstracts</a>
