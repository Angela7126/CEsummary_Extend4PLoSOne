VBecause these discourse models appear to capture high-level information about answer structures, we hypothesize that the models should make use of many of the same discourse features, even when training on data from different domains
p1
aVThus, to answer NF questions, one needs a model of what these answer structures look like
p2
aVThe first is a measure of the overall LS similarity of the question and answer candidate, which is computed as the cosine similarity between the two composite vectors of the question and the answer candidate
p3
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this is one of the most striking demonstrations of domain transfer in answer ranking for non-factoid QA, and highlights the generality of these discourse features in identifying answer structures across domains and genres
p4
aVSo far, we have treated LS and discourse as distinct features in the reranking model, However, given that LS features greatly improve the CR baseline, we hypothesize that a natural extension to the discourse models would be to make use of LS similarity (in addition to the traditional information retrieval similarity) to label discourse segments
p5
aVArgument labels indicate only if lemmas from the question were found in a discourse structure present in an answer candidate, and do not speak to the specific lemmas that were found
p6
aVHere, both the CR and full model chose a paragraph containing a different gold answer
p7
aVWe demonstrate good domain transfer performance between these corpora, suggesting that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain, and thus broadly applicable to NF QA
p8
aVWe propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework [ 7 ]
p9
aVTo tease apart the relative contribution of discourse features that occur only within a single sentence versus features that span multiple sentences, we examined the performance of the full model when using only intra-sentence features, i.e.,, SR0 features for DMM, and features based on discourse relations where both EDUs appear in the same sentence for DPM, versus the full intersentence models
p10
aVWe extend this work by showing that discourse models coupled with LS achieve the best performance for NF AR
p11
aVSpecifically, as in § 4.3 , we compute the cosine similarity between the composite LS vectors of the question text and each marker argument (in DMM) or EDU (in DPM), and label the corresponding answer segment QSEG if this score is higher than a threshold, or OTHER otherwise
p12
aVFinally, while the discourse models perform well for HOW or manner questions, performance on Bio WHY corpus suggests that reason questions are particularly amenable to discourse analysis
p13
aVThe discourse parser model (DPM) is based on the RST discourse framework [ 7 ]
p14
aV[ 20 ] extracted 47 cue phrases such as because from a small collection of web documents, and used the cosine similarity between an answer candidate and a bag of words containing these cue phrases as a single feature in their reranking model for non-factoid why QA
p15
aVIt is important to note that these discourse features are more expressive than features based on discourse markers alone [ 5 , 19 ]
p16
aVHowever, as discussed, gold answers may unevenly straddle paragraph boundaries, and the paragraph chosen by the model happened to have a somewhat lower overlap with its gold answer than the one chosen by the baseline
p17
aVIn these cases, the model selected an on-topic answer paragraph in the same subsection of the textbook as a gold answer
p18
aV15 15 The performance of all models can ultimately be increased by using more sophisticated learning frameworks, and considering more answer candidates in CR (for Bio
p19
aVFor example, if the best answer for a question appears at rank 2 with an F1 score of 0.3 , the corresponding MRR score is 0.3 / 2
p20
aVThe model chose a paragraph that had many of the same words as the question, but is on a different topic
p21
aVThe ensemble model without LS (third line) has a nearly identical P@1 score as the equivalent in-domain model (line 13 in Table 1), while slightly surpassing in-domain MRR performance
p22
aVWe adapted them to this dataset by weighing each answer by its overlap with gold answers, where overlap is measured as the highest F1 score between the candidate and a gold answer
p23
aVThus, for a given question, all its answers are fetched from the answer collection, and an initial ranking is constructed based on the cosine similarity between theirs and the question u'\u005cu2019' s lemma vector representations, with lemmas weighted using tf.idf (Ch
p24
aVDue to the speed limitations of the discourse parser, we randomly drew 10,000 QA pairs from the corpus of how questions described by Surdeanu et al
p25
aV9 9 We investigated more complex features, e.g.,, by exploring depths of two and three in the discourse tree, and also models that relied on tree kernels over these trees, but none improved upon this simple representation
p26
aVWe use this setup to answer questions from a biology textbook, where each section is indexed as a standalone document, and each paragraph in a given document is considered as a candidate answer
p27
aVThe in-domain performance of the ensemble model is similar to that of the single classifier in both YA and Bio HOW so we omit these results here for simplicity
p28
aVThus, P@1 reduces to this F1 score for the top answer
p29
aVThese composite vectors are assembled by summing the vectors for individual question (or answer candidate) words, and re-normalizing this composite vector to unit length
p30
aVFor example, for the question u'\u005cu201d' How are fossil fuels formed, and why do they contain so much energy u'\u005cu201d' , the model selected an answer that mentions fossil fuels in a larger discussion of human ecological footprints
p31
aVIn the Bio corpus, because answer candidates are not guaranteed to match gold annotations exactly, these metrics do not immediately apply
p32
aVSimilar to the DMM, these features take real values obtained by averaging the cosine similarity of the arguments with the question content
p33
aVIf text before or after a marker out to a given sentence range matches the entire text of the question (with a cosine similarity score larger than a threshold), that argument takes on the label QSEG , or OTHER otherwise
p34
aVBecause we are adding two new discourse models, we now tune four segment matching thresholds, one for each of the DMM, DPM, DMM L u'\u005cu2062' S , and DPM L u'\u005cu2062' S models
p35
aVBecause the number of answer candidates is typically large (e.g.,, equal to the number of paragraphs in the textbook), we return the N top candidates with the highest scores
p36
aV[ 17 ] using their filtering criteria, with the additional criterion that answers had to contain at least four community-generated answers, one of which was voted as the top answer
p37
aV8 8 Including these scores as features in the reranker model is a common strategy that ensures that the reranker takes advantage of the analysis already performed by the CR model
p38
aVExamples of these markers include and, in, that, for, if, as, not, by, and but ; (2) two marker arguments , i.e.,, text segments before and after the marker, labeled to indicate if they are related to the question text or not; and (3) a sentence range around the marker, which defines the length of these segments (e.g.,, ± 2 sentences
p39
aV1) A discourse marker from Daniel Marcu u'\u005cu2019' s list (see Appendix B in Marcu [ 9 ] ), that serves as a divisive boundary between sentences
p40
aVWe demonstrate that modeling discourse is greatly beneficial for NF AR for two types of NF questions, manner ( u'\u005cu201c' how u'\u005cu201d' ) and reason ( u'\u005cu201c' why u'\u005cu201d' ), across two large datasets from different genres and domains u'\u005cu2013' one from the community question-answering (CQA) site of Yahoo
p41
aVOften times this paragraph directly preceded or followed the gold answer
p42
aVThe entire biology text (at paragraph granularity) serves as the possible set of answers
p43
aVWe chose the Bio setup for this analysis because it is more complex than the CQA one here gold answers may have a granularity completely different from what the system choses as best answers (in our particular case, the QA system is currently limited to answers consisting of single paragraphs, whereas gold answers may be of any size
p44
aVNote that, because these domains are considerably different from the RST Treebank, the parser fails to produce a tree on a large number of answer candidates
p45
aV7 7 http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm_light/svm_rank.html In addition to these features, each reranker also includes a single feature containing the score of each candidate, as computed by the above candidate retrieval (CR) component
p46
aVWe label marker arguments based on their similarity to question content
p47
aVWe derive two LS measures from these vectors, which are then are included as features in the reranker
p48
aVThe number of answers to each question ranged from 4 to over 50, with the average 9
p49
aVThis is problematic for NF QA, where questions are answered not by atomic facts, but by larger cross-sentence conceptual structures that convey the desired answers
p50
aVWe propose two separate discourse representation schemes u'\u005cu2013' one shallow, centered around discourse markers, and one deep, based on RST
p51
aVTo this end, for every relation, we extract the entire text dominated by each of its arguments, and we generate labels for the two participants in the relation using the same strategy as the DMM (based on the similarity with the question content
p52
aVHowever, this also introduces noise because discourse analysis is a complex task and discourse parsers are not perfect
p53
aV[ 22 ] , we include lexical semantics in our reranking model
p54
aVWe hypothesize that the limited transfer observed for models with LS compared to their counterparts without LS is due to the disparity in the size and utility of the biology LS training data compared to the open-domain LS resources
p55
aVWe implemented two such models, denoted DMM L u'\u005cu2062' S and DPM L u'\u005cu2062' S , by replacing the component that assigns argument labels with one that relies on LS
p56
aVTo mitigate this, we used a simple feature generation strategy, which creates one feature for each individual discourse relation by concatenating the relation type with the labels of the discourse units participating in it
p57
aV[ 18 ] conducted an initial evaluation of the utility of RST structures to why QA by evaluating performance on a small sample of seven WSJ articles drawn from the RST Treebank [ 1 ]
p58
aVThis disparity is likely due to the difficulty in assembling LS training data at an appropriate level for the biology corpus, contrasted with the relative abundance of large scale open-domain lexical semantic resources
p59
aVFor the YA CQA corpora, 50% of QA pairs were used for training, 25% for development, and 25% for test
p60
aVNote that while our system retrieves answers at paragraph granularity, the expert was not constrained in any way during the annotation process, so gold answers might be smaller than a paragraph or span multiple paragraphs
p61
aVFurther, the text preceeding by matches text from the question (and is therefore labeled QSEG ), while the text after by differs considerably from the question text, and is labeled OTHER
p62
aVThe setup in this paper, commonly used in the CQA community [ 21 ] , is more relevant here because it includes both high and low quality answers
p63
aVHere we use no meta data and rely solely on linguistic features
p64
aVThe body of work on factoid QA is too broad to be discussed here (see, e.g.,, the TREC workshops for an overview
p65
aVBecause of the small size of the Bio corpus, it was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, with three folds for training, one for development, and one for test
p66
aVExamining Table 1 , several trends are clear
p67
aV[ 12 ] built a classifier to identify causal relations using a small set of cue phrases (e.g.,, because and is caused by
p68
aVLike any language model, a RNNLM estimates the probability of observing a word given the preceding context, but, in this process, it learns word embeddings into a latent, conceptual space with a fixed number of dimensions
p69
aVIn the bottom part of Figure 2 , we show hypotactic relations as directed arrows, from the nucleus to the satellite
p70
aVThis confirms existing evidence that ensemble models perform better cross-domain because they overfit less [ 2 , 4 ]
p71
aVConsequently, related words tend to have vectors that are close to each other in this space
p72
aVThe latter was created by extracting a) pages matching a word/phrase in a glossary of biology (derived from the textbook); plus (b) pages hyperlinked from (a) that are also tagged as being in a small set of (hand-selected) biology-related categories
