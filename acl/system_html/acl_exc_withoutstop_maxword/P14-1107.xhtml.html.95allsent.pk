VThis allows us to compare the BLEU score achieved by our methods against the BLEU scores achievable by professional translators
p1
aVSince we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score [ 27 ] for one professional translator (P1) using the other three (P2,3,4) as a reference set
p2
aVIn the following sections, we evaluate each of our methods by calculating BLEU scores against the same four sets of three reference translations
p3
aVThis output translation is the result of the combined translation and editing stages
p4
aVWe use translation edit rate (TER) as a measure of translation similarity
p5
aVUsing the raw translations without post-editing, our graph-based ranking method achieves a BLEU score of 38.89, compared to Zaidan and Callison-Burch ( 2011 ) u'\u005cu2019' s reported score of 28.13, which they achieved using a linear feature-based classification
p6
aVTo establish an upper bound for our methods, and to determine if there exist high-quality Turker translations at all, we compute four oracle scores
p7
aVTherefore, each number reported in our experimental results is an average of four numbers, corresponding to the four possible ways of choosing 3 of the 4 reference sets
p8
aVAs a naive baseline, we choose one candidate translation at random for each input Urdu sentence
p9
aVTheir linear classifier achieved a reported score of 39.06 2 2 Note that the data we used in our experiments are slightly different, by discarding nearly 100 NULL sentences in the raw data
p10
aVTER represents the amount of change necessary to transform one sentence into another, so a low TER means the two sentences are very similar
p11
aVWe measure aggressiveness by looking at the TER between the pre- and post-edited versions of each editor u'\u005cu2019' s translations; higher TER implies more aggressive editing
p12
aVTherefore, our method operates over a heterogeneous network that includes translators and post-editors as well as the translated sentences that they produce
p13
aVAccording to our experiments, most of the results generated by baselines and oracles are very close to the previously reported values when combining information from both translators and editors
p14
aVThis is because the cost of hiring professional translators is prohibitively high
p15
aVThey also hired US-based Turkers to edit the translations, since the translators were largely based in Pakistan and exhibited errors that are characteristic of speakers of English as a language
p16
aV1) based on the unedited translations only and 2) based on the edited sentences after translator/editor collaborations
p17
aVSince the oracles select from a small group of only 4 translations per source segment, they are not overly optimistic, and rather reflect the true potential of the collected translations
p18
aVThe ranking method allows us to obtain a global ranking by taking into account the intra-/inter-component dependencies
p19
aVThis material is based on research sponsored by a DARPA Computer Science Study Panel phase 3 award entitled u'\u005cu201c' Crowdsourcing Translation u'\u005cu201d' (contract D12PC00368
p20
aVWe first examine the centroid-based ranking on the candidate sub-graph ( G C ) alone to see the effect of voting among translated sentences; we denote this strategy as plain ranking
p21
aVWe also split our editors into 5 bins, based on their effectiveness (i.e., the average amount by which their editing reduces TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d
p22
aVTo address this question, we split our translations into 5 bins, based on their TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d
p23
aVA candidate is important if 1) it is similar to many of the other proposed candidates and 2) it is authored by better qualified translators and/or post-editors
p24
aVThere are various options for creating training data for new language pairs
p25
aVThis result supports the intuition that a denser collaboration matrix will help propagate saliency to good translators/post-editors and hence provides better predictions for candidate quality
p26
aVThis setup presents unique challenges, since it typically involves non-professional translators whose language skills are varied, and since it sometimes involves participants who try to cheat to get the small financial reward [ 43 ]
p27
aVUntil relatively recently, little consideration has been given to creating parallel data from scratch
p28
aVThen we incorporate the standard random walk on the Turker graph ( G T ) to include the structural information but without yet including any collaboration information; that is, we incorporate information from G T and G C without including edges linking the two together
p29
aVEdges in G T u'\u005cu2062' C connect author pairs (nodes in G T ) to the candidate that they produced (nodes in G C
p30
aVThese two graphs, G T and G C are combined as subgraphs of a third graph ( G T u'\u005cu2062' C
p31
aVThe Turker graph, G T , is an undirected graph whose edges represent u'\u005cu201c' collaboration u'\u005cu201d' Formally, let t i and t j be two translator/editor pairs; we say that pair t i u'\u005cu201c' collaborates with u'\u005cu201d' pair t j (and therefore, there is an edge between t i and t j ) if t i and t j share either a translator or an editor (or share both a translator and an editor
p32
aVTo this end, we must make the c and t column stochastic [ 20 ] c and t are therefore normalized after each iteration of Equation (4) and (5
p33
aVBecause of this, collecting parallel corpora for minor languages has become an interesting research challenge
p34
aVWe treat a candidate as a short document and weight each term with tf.idf [ 23 ] , where tf is the term frequency and idf is the inverse document frequency
p35
aVThis drastically limits which languages SMT can be successfully applied to
p36
aVBy fusing the above equations, we can have the following iterative calculation in matrix forms
p37
aVThe first oracle operates at the segment level on the sentences produced by translators only for each source segment, we choose from the translations the one that scores highest (in terms of BLEU) against the reference sentences
p38
aVThe approach which selects the translations with the minimum average TER [ 33 ] against the other three translations (the u'\u005cu201c' consensus u'\u005cu201d' translation) achieves BLEU scores of 35.78
p39
aVThe second method selects the translation generated by the Turker who, on average, provides translations with the minimum average TER
p40
aVThe third oracle operates at the worker level for each source segment, we choose from the translations the one provided by the worker whose translations (over all sentences) score the highest on average
p41
aVThe first method selects the translation with the minimum average TER [ 33 ] against the other translations; intuitively, this would represent the u'\u005cu201c' consensus u'\u005cu201d' translation
p42
aVFor comparison, the data also includes 4 different reference translations for each source sentence, produced by professional translators
p43
aVTo capture the quality ( u'\u005cu201c' professionalness u'\u005cu201d' ) of a translation, we take the average TER of the translation against each of our gold translations
p44
aVThe problem definition of the crowdsourcing translation task is straightforward given a set of candidate translations for a source sentence, we want to choose the best output translation
p45
aVOn average, the reference translations give a score of 42.38
p46
aVWe repeat the process four times, scoring each professional translator against the others, to calculate the expected range of professional quality translation
p47
aVWe form two graphs the first graph ( G T ) represents Turkers (translator/editor pairs) as nodes; the second graph ( G C ) represents candidate translated and post-edited sentences (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' candidates u'\u005cu201d' ) as nodes
p48
aVAlthough hiring professional translators to create bilingual training data for machine translation systems has been deemed infeasible, Mechanical Turk has provided a low cost way of creating large volumes of translations [ 9 , 3 ]
p49
aVThis result suggests that finding good editor/translator pairs, rather than good editors and good translators in isolation, should produce the best translations overall
p50
aVThis boost in BLEU score confirms our intuition that the hidden collaboration networks between candidate translations and transltor/editor pairs are indeed useful
p51
aVThe fourth oracle also operates at the worker level, but selects from sentences produced by translator/post-editor collaborations
p52
aVTable 1 gives an example of an unedited translation, an edited translation, and a professional translation for the same sentence
p53
aVTo sort good translations from bad, researchers often solicit multiple, redundant translations and then build models to try to predict which translations are the best, or which translators tend to produce the highest quality translations
p54
aVStatistical machine translation (SMT) systems are trained using bilingual sentence-aligned parallel corpora
p55
aVFigure 3 gives an example of how an initially medium-quality translation, when combined with good editing, produces a better result than the higher-quality translation paired with mediocre editing
p56
aVIn order to determine a value for u'\u005cu039b' , we used the average BLEU, computed against the professional reference translations, as a tuning metric
p57
aVWe see that good editors are able to make improvements to translations of all qualities, but that good editing has the greatest impact on lower quality translations
p58
aVIn our setup the poor translations are produced by bilingual individuals who are weak in the target language, and in their experiments the translations are the output of a machine translation system
p59
aVThe second oracle is applied similarly, but chooses from the candidates produced by the collaboration of translator/post-editor pairs
p60
aVWe are interested in testing our random walk method, which incorporates information from both the candidate translations and from the Turkers
p61
aVFor instance, Germann ( 2001 ) hoped to hire professional translators to create a modest sized 100,000 word Tamil-English parallel corpus, but were stymied by the costs and the difficulty of finding good translators for a short-term commitment
p62
aVTheoretically, SMT can be applied to any language pair, but in practice it produces the state-of-art results only for language pairs with ample training data, like English-Arabic, English-Chinese, French-English, etc
p63
aVAs discussed, we model the collection of candidates as a weighted undirected graph, G C , in which nodes in the graph represent candidate sentences and edges represent lexical relatedness
p64
aVThey solicited multiple redundant translations from different Turkers for a collection of Urdu sentences that had been previously professionally translated by the Linguistics Data Consortium
p65
aV× 1 to denote the saliency scores u'\u005cu03a0' of candidates and Turker pairs
p66
aV52 different Turkers took part in the translation task, each translating 138 sentences on average
p67
aVInterestingly, we observe that when modeling the linkage between the collaboration pairs, connecting Turker pairs which share either a translator or the post-editor achieves better performance than connecting pairs that share only translators or connecting pairs which share only editors
p68
aVThis data set consists 1,792 Urdu sentences from a variety of news and online sources, each paired with English translations provided by non-professional translators on Mechanical Turk
p69
aVAs expected, random selection yields bad performance, with a BLEU score of 30.52
p70
aVThese oracle methods represent ideal solutions under our scenario
p71
aVThis paper is most closely related to previous work by Zaidan and Callison-Burch ( 2011 ) , who showed that non-professional translators could approach the level of professional translators
p72
aVIn contrast, our proposed graph-based ranking framework achieves a score of 41.43 when using the same information
p73
aVTo put this in perspective, the output of a state-of-the-art machine translation system (the syntax-based variant of Joshua) achieves a score of 26.91, which is reported in [ 43 ]
p74
aVThis trend conforms to our intuition that editing is most useful when the translation has much room for improvement, and opens the question of whether good editors can offer improvements to translations of all qualities
p75
aVIn this work, we show that the collaboration design of two heads u'\u005cu2013' non-professional Urdu translators and non-professional English editors u'\u005cu2013' yields better translated output than would either one working in isolation, and can better approximate the quality of professional translators
p76
aVSome editors may be very aggressive (they make many changes to the original translation) but still be ineffective (they fail to bring the quality of the translation closer to that of a professional
p77
aVDo all translations improve with editing
p78
aVTo measure effectiveness, we look at the change in TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d that results from the editing; negative u'\u005cu0394' TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d means the editor effectively improved the quality of the translation, while positive u'\u005cu0394' TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d means the editing actually brought the translation further from our gold standard
p79
aVFor numerical computation of the saliency scores, the initial scores of all sentences and Turkers are set to 1 and the following two steps are alternated until convergence to select the best candidate
p80
aVA new graph-based algorithm for selecting the best translation among multiple translations of the same input
p81
aVSMT gets stuck in a severe bottleneck for many minority or u'\u005cu2018' low resource u'\u005cu2019' languages with insufficient data
p82
aVThat is, we define TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d of translation t as
p83
aVEach Urdu sentence was translated redundantly by 3 distinct translators, and each translation was edited by 3 separate (native English-speaking) editors to correct for grammatical and stylistic errors
p84
aVThese have focused on an iterative collaboration between monolingual speakers of the two languages, facilitated with a machine translation system
p85
aVFigure 2 shows the degree to which editors at each level are able to improve the translations from each bin
p86
aVLet G denote the heterogeneous graph with nodes V and edges E
p87
aVThis method takes into account the collaborative relationship between the translators and the editors
p88
aVWe see that while most translations require only a few edits, there are a large number of translations which improve substantially after heavy editing
p89
aVThe oracles indicate that there is usually an acceptable translation from the Turkers for any given sentence
p90
aVWe also examine two voting-inspired methods
p91
aVWe review relevant research from NLP and human-computer interaction (HCI) on collaborative translation processes in Section 2
p92
aVwhere a lower TER g u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' d is indicative of a higher quality (more professional-sounding) translation

p96
aVThis suggests that both sources of information u'\u005cu2013' the candidate itself and its authors u'\u005cu2013' are important for the crowdsourcing translation task

p100
aVIn the editing task, 320 Turkers participated, averaging 56 sentences each
p101
aVA natural approach for trying to shore up the skills of weak bilinguals is to pair them with a native speaker of the target language to edit their translations
p102
aVIn total, this gives us 12 non-professional English candidate sentences (3 unedited, 9 edited) per original Urdu sentence
p103
aVThis ranking schema is actually a reinforced process across the heterogeneous graphs
p104
aVWe know from inspection that translations seem to improve with editing (Table 1
p105
aVFinally, we examine the two-step collaboration based candidate-Turker graph using several variations on edge establishment
p106
aVAnalogously, a translator/editor pair is believed to be better qualified if 1) the editor is collaborating with a good translator and vice versa and 2) the pair has authored important candidates
p107
aVRather than relying on volunteers or gamification, NLP research into crowdsourcing translation has focused on hiring workers on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform [ 9 ]
p108
aVThe translations provided by translators on MTurk are generally done conscientiously, preserving the meaning of the source sentence, but typically contain simple mistakes like misspellings, typos, and awkward word choice
p109
aVWe investigate three settings in which 1) edges connect two nodes when they share only a translator, 2) edges connect two nodes when they share only a post-editor, and 3) edges connect two nodes when they share either a translator or a post-editor

aVWe examine the relative contribution of each component of our approach on the overall performance
p123
aVWe define an edge u'\u005cu2019' s weight to be the cosine similarity between the candidates represented by the nodes that it connects

aVThese studies are similar to ours in that they rely on native speakers u'\u005cu2019' understanding of the target language to correct the disfluencies in poor translations
