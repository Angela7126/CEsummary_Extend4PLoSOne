<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In our case this is not appropriate, so the final rank for each mention is determined after graph ranking, by combining the graph rank with the initial confidence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Initial confidence is used as an initial rank for the graph nodes, while entities u'\u2019' coherence measures are used as link weights which play a role in distributing a node u'\u2019' s rank over its outgoing nodes</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our approach first ranks all nodes in the solution graph using the Page-Rank algorithm, then re-ranks all nodes by combining the initial confidence and graph ranking</a>
