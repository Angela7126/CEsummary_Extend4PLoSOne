VWordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding word forms) that are semantic related to the inventory senses under WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been exploited by many existing studies
p1
aVThe input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' , while the similarity measure remains unchanged
p2
aVThese systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods
p3
aVSpecifically, highly similar, fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both semantic and
