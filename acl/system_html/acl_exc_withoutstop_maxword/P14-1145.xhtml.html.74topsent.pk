VOur belief propagation based connotation sentiment inference algorithm has one user-specified parameter u'\u005cu0395' (see Table 1
p1
aVTherefore in this work, we employ a computationally tractable (in fact linearly scalable with network size) approximate inference algorithm called Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) [ 37 ] , which we extend to handle typed graphs like our connotation graph

aVHowever, as for the second sense, for which u'\u005cu201c' burst u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' bristle u'\u005cu201d' can be used interchangeably with respect to this particular sense, 1 1 Hence a sense in WordNet is defined by synset (= synonym set) , which is the set of words sharing the same sense the general overtone is slightly more negative with a touch of unpleasantness, or at least not as positive as that of the first sense

aVConnotationWordNet is expected to be the superset of a sentiment lexicon, as it is highly
