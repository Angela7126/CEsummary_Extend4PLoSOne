<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Guided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In a shallow-analysis approach to measuring syntactic complexity, we rely on the distribution of POS bigrams at every proficiency level to be representative of the range</a>
