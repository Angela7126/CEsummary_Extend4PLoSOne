<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u201c' backwards u'\u201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We associate each sentence with an undirected latent tree graphical model, which is a tree consisting of both observed variables (corresponding to the words in the sentence) and an additional set of latent variables that are unobserved in the data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Chow-Liu algorithm essentially computes the distances among all pairs of variables (the negative of the mutual information) and then finds the minimum cost tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>What is needed is a u'\u201c' special u'\u201d' distance function that allows us to reverse engineer the distances among the latent variables given</a>
