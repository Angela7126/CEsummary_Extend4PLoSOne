<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This dense representation should preserve the information from the bag-of-words input, meanwhile alleviate data sparse problem</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since the vectors from DAE are trained using information from monolingual training data independently, these vectors may be inadequate to measure bilingual topic similarity due to their different topic spaces</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, it helps to train a smarter translation model with the embedded topic information</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since a parallel sentence pair should have the same topic, our goal is to maximize the similarity score between the source sentence and target sentence</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our problem fits well into the neural network framework and we expect that it can further improve inferring the topic representations for sentences</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the pre-training phase, all parallel data is fed into two neural networks respectively for DAE training, where network parameters W and b are randomly initialized</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is not simply coincidence since we can interpret their approach as a special case in our neural network method when a parallel</a>
