<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For the semantic reordering model, it takes a PAS and models its reordering on the target side</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models, and the gain achieved by the semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the MR08 syntactic features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For models with syntactic reordering, we add two new features (i.e.,, one for the leftmost reordering model and the other for the rightmost reordering model) into the log-linear translation model in Eq</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board</a>
