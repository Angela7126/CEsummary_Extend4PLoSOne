VThus, if u'\u005cu0391' + u'\u005cu0392' = 1 , Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s ratio model becomes simply

aVMotivated by the problem of measuring how well the distribution of one word w 1 captures the distribution of another w 2 , Weeds and Weir [ 21 ] also explore asymmetric models, expressing similarity calculations as weighted combinations of
