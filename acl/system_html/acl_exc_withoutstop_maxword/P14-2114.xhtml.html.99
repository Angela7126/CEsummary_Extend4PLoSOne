<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this model, we assume that each tweet message m u'\u2208' { 1 u'\u2062' M } is assigned to one event instance e , while e is modeled as a joint distribution over the named entities y , the date/time d when the event occurred, the location l where the event occurred and the event-related keywords k</a>
