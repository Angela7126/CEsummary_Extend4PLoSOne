<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For a small set of frequent, conventionalized abbreviations (e.g.,, ca for California u'\u2014' 63 pairs in total u'\u2014' mainly state abbreviations and similar items), we assign an fixed pair LM score, since these examples are in effect irregular cases, where the regularities of the productive abbreviation process do not capture their true cost</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the other hand, someone who writes svc ctr for service center in a product review is probably merely trying to save time and so expanding the abbreviations in that</a>
