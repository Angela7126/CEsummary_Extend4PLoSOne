VWe generalize the latent variable violation-fixing perceptron framework to inexact search over hypergraphs, which subsumes previous algorithms for PBMT and bottom-up parsing as special cases (see Fig

aVAfter numerous attempts by various researchers [ 17 , 20 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 9 , 10 ] , the recent work of \u005cnewcite yu+:2013 finally reveals a major reason it is the vast amount of (inevitable) search errors in MT decoding that astray learning
