VThe max-violation method performs the update where the model score difference between the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and the best y -good partial derivation is maximal, by penalizing the incorrect Viterbi partial derivation and rewarding the y -good partial derivation

aVIf a boundary word does not occur in the reference, its index is set to u'\u005cu221e' so that its language model score will always be - u'\u005cu221e' ; if a boundary word occurs more than once in the reference, its - u'\u005cu2062' LM node is split into multiple + u'\u005cu2062' LM nodes, one for each such index
