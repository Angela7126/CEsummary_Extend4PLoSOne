VWe evaluate CoSimRank for the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction
p1
aVThe disadvantage of this similarity measure is significant and even more visible on bilingual lexicon extraction than on synonym extraction (see Table 2
p2
aV4 ) for synonym extraction and the two-graph version (Eq
p3
aVCompared to PPR+cos, CoSimRank is roughly four times faster on synonym extraction and has comparable performance on lexicon extraction
p4
aVSynonym extraction is run on the English graph
p5
aVCompared to SimRank, CoSimRank is more than 40 times faster on synonym extraction and six times faster on lexicon extraction
p6
aVWe use the basic version of CoSimRank (Eq
p7
aVThe counteracting effects of fewer iterations and more vector similarity computations can give either CoSimRank or PPR+cos an advantage, as is the case for synonym extraction and lexicon extraction, respectively
p8
aVFor lexicon extraction, we use the
p9
