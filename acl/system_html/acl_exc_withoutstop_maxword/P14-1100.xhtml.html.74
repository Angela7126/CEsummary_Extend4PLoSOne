<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Following this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing states and words for each tag sequence u'\ud835' u'\udc99' as a latent tree graphical model, which encodes conditional independences among the words given the latent states</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u201c' backwards u'\u201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Unlike in phylogenetics and graphical models, where a single latent tree is constructed for all the data, in our case, each part of speech sequence is associated with its own parse tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics</a>
