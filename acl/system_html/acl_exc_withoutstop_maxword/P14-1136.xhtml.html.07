<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, akin to the first context function, we also added all dependency labels to the context set</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space representation</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most work on frame-semantic parsing has usually divided the task into two major subtasks frame identification , namely the disambiguation of a given predicate to a frame, and argument identification (or semantic role labeling), the analysis</a>
