VFor each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles
p1
aVSharing restrictions and rate limits on Twitter data collection only allowed us to recreate a semblance of ZLR data 6 6 This inability to perfectly replicate prior work based on Twitter is a recognized problem throughout the community of computational social science, arising from the data policies of Twitter itself, it is not specific to this work u'\u005cu2013' 193 Democratic and 178 Republican users with 1K tweets per user, and 20 neighbors of four types including follower, friends, user mention and retweet with 200 tweets per neighbor for each user of interest
p2
aV[ 7 ] rely on identifying strong partisan clusters of Democratic and Republican users in a Twitter network based on retweet and user mention degree of connectivity, and then combine this clustering information with the follower and friend neighborhood size features
p3
aVFinally, similarly to the results for the user model given in Figure 3 , increasing the number of tweets per neighbor from 5 to 200 leads to a significant gain in performance for all neighborhood types
p4
aVOther methods characterize Twitter users by applying limited amounts of network structure information in addition to lexical features
p5
aVWe show that three of six social circles u'\u005cu2013' friend, retweet and user-mention yield better accuracy compared to the user model for all graphs when t u'\u005cu2265' 250

aVIn addition, we propose streaming models for personal analytics that dynamically update user labels based on their stream of communications which has been addressed previously by Van Durme ( 2012b
p7
aVHowever, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10
p8
aVBaseline User Model As input we are given a set of vertices representing users of interest v i u'\u005cu2208' V along with feature vectors f u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2062' ( v i ) derived from content authored by the user of interest
p9
aV[ 30 ] suggest a hierarchical Bayesian model which takes advantage of user name morphology for predicting user gender and ethnicity
p10
aVThe existing batch models for predicting latent user attributes rely on thousands of tweets per author [ 31 , 7 , 27 , 5 , 42 , 21 ]
p11
aVSimilar to our work, they assume that users from a particular class tend to reply and retweet messages of the users from the same class
p12
aVNext we propose to extend the baseline model by taking advantage of language in user social circles as describe below
p13
aVThus, for effectively classifying a given user v i it is
