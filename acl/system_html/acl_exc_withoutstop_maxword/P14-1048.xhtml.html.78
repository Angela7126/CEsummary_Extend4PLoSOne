<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For each sentence S k with m k EDUs, the overall time complexity to perform intra-sentential parsing is O u'\u2062' ( m k 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because the structure model is the first component in our pipeline of local models, its accuracy is crucial</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, as shown in Table 2 , the average number of sentences in a document is 26.11, which is already too large for optimal parsing models, e.g.,, the CKY-like parsing algorithm in j CRF, let alone the fact that the largest document contains several hundred of EDUs and sentences</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is possible to optimize Joty et al u'\u2019' s CKY-like parsing by replacing their CRF-based computation for upper-level constituents with some local computation based on the probabilities of lower-level constituents</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After an intra- or multi-sentential discourse tree is fully built, we perform a post-editing to consider possible modifications to the current tree, by considering useful information from the discourse constituents on upper levels, which is unavailable in the bottom-up tree-building process</a>
