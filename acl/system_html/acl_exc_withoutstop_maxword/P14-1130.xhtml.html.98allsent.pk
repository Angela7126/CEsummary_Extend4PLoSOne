VBecause of this issue, Cirik and u'\u005cu015e' ensoy ( 2013 ) used word vectors only as unigram features (without combinations) as part of a shift reduce parser [ 32 ]
p1
aVFor each word in the sentence, we add its own word vector as well as the vectors of its left and right words
p2
aVThis framework enables us to learn new syntactically guided embeddings while also leveraging separately estimated word vectors as starting features, leading to improved parsing performance
p3
aVIn contrast, we represent words as vectors in a manner that is directly optimized for parsing
p4
aVThis low dimensional syntactic abstraction can be thought of as a proxy to manually constructed POS tags
p5
aVWe begin by representing high-dimensional feature vectors as multi-way cross-products of smaller feature vectors that represent words and their syntactic relations (arcs
p6
aVTo add auxiliary word vector representations, we use the publicly available word vectors [ 5 ] , learned from raw data [ 13 , 20 ]
p7
aVEach entry of the word vector is added as a feature value into feature vectors u'\u005cu03a6' h and u'\u005cu03a6' m
p8
aVWe thank Volkan Cirik for sharing the unsupervised word vector data
p9
aVFrom a computational perspective, adding non-sparse vectors directly as features, including their combinations, can significantly increase the number of active features for scoring syntactic structures (e.g.,, dependency arc
p10
aVWord-level vector space embeddings have so far had limited impact on parsing performance
p11
aVFinally, we use a similar set of feature templates as Turbo v2.1 for 3rd order parsing
p12
aVWe depart from this view and leverage high-dimensional feature vectors by mapping them into low dimensional representations
p13
aVThe resulting embedding is therefore tied to the syntactic roles of the words (and arcs), and learned in order to perform well in parsing
p14
aVSince our model learns a compressed representation of feature vectors, we are interested to measure its performance when part-of-speech tags are not provided (See Table 4
p15
aVThe two r-dimension vectors are concatenated as an u'\u005cu201c' averaged u'\u005cu201d' vector
p16
aVBy learning parameters U , V , and W that function well in dependency parsing, we also learn context-dependent embeddings for words and arcs
p17
aVEach y is understood as a collection of arcs h u'\u005cu2192' m where h and m index words in x
p18
aVMoreover, by controlling the amount of information we can extract from each of the component feature vectors (via rank r ), the statistical estimation problem does not scale dramatically with the dimensions of u'\u005cu03a6' h , u'\u005cu03a6' m and u'\u005cu03a6' h , m
p19
aVSuch problems include, for example, multi-task learning and collaborative filtering
p20
aVWe will start by introducing the notation used in the paper, followed by a more formal description of our dependency parsing task
p21
aVAs Table 3 shows, adding this information increases the parsing performance for all the three languages
p22
aVTherefore updating parameters and decoding a sentence is still efficient, i.e.,, linear in the number of values of the feature vector
p23
aVWe can alternatively specify arc features in terms of rank-1 tensors by taking the Kronecker product of simpler feature vectors associated with the head (vector u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n ), and modifier (vector u'\u005cu03a6' m u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n ), as well as the arc itself (vector u'\u005cu03a6' h , m u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d
p24
aVBy taking the cross-product of all these component feature vectors, we obtain the full feature representation for arc h u'\u005cu2192' m as a rank-1 tensor
p25
aVFor example, we can easily incorporate additional useful features in the feature vectors u'\u005cu03a6' h , u'\u005cu03a6' m and u'\u005cu03a6' h , m , since the low-rank assumption (for small enough r ) effectively counters the otherwise uncontrolled feature expansion
p26
aVThe associated parameters are viewed as a tensor (multi-way array) of low rank, and optimized for parsing performance
p27
aVAs described in previous section, we do so by appending the values of different coordinates in the word vector into u'\u005cu03a6' h and u'\u005cu03a6' m
p28
aVFollowing standard machine learning practices, these algorithms iteratively select a subset of features by optimizing parsing performance on a development set
p29
aVTherefore, we may suffer a performance loss if we select only a small subset of the features
p30
aVIn contrast, we expand features for parsing into a multi-way tensor, and operate with an explicit low-rank representation of the associated parameter tensor
p31
aVBy automatically selecting a small number of dimensions useful for parsing, we can leverage a wide array of (correlated) features
p32
aVTensors are increasingly used as tools in spectral estimation [ 15 ] , including in parsing [ 6 ] and other NLP problems [ 10 ] , where the goal is to avoid local optima in maximum likelihood estimation
p33
aVNote that elements of this rank-1 tensor include feature combinations that are not part of the feature crossings in u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m
p34
aVThese features are not redundant
p35
aVThe majority of features in this MST component can be expressed as elements of the feature tensor, i.e.,, as [ u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2297' u'\u005cu03a6' m u'\u005cu2297' u'\u005cu03a6' h , m ] i , j , k
p36
aVThe decoding algorithm for the third-order parsing is based on [ 46 ]
p37
aVBy comparing NT-1st and NT-3rd (models without low-rank) with our full model (with low-rank), we obtain 0.7% absolute improvement on first-order parsing, and 0.3% improvement on third-order parsing
p38
aVLearning of the tensor is harder because the scoring function is not linear (nor convex) with respect to parameters U , V and W
p39
aVIn other words, keeping updating the model may lead to large parameter values and over-fitting
p40
aVOn the other hand, by including all the rich features, we face over-fitting problems
p41
aVSpecifically, U u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h (for a given sentence, suppressed) is an r dimensional vector representation of the word corresponding to h as a head word
p42
aVBased on this feature representation, we define the score of each arc as s u'\u005cu0398' ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) = u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0398' , u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m u'\u005cu27e9' where u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' L represent adjustable parameters to be learned, and L is the number of parameters (and possible features in u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m
p43
aVThe sparse matrix is used to highlight a small number of parameters that should vary independently even if most of them lie on a low-dimensional subspace [ 42 , 4 ]
p44
aVWe will commence here by casting first-order dependency parsing as a tensor estimation problem
p45
aVMany machine learning problems can be cast as matrix problems where the matrix represents a set of co-varying parameters
p46
aVWe will directly learn a low-rank tensor A (because r is small) in this form as one of our model parameters
p47
aVBased on these results, estimating a rank-50 tensor together with MST parameters only increases the running time by a factor of 1.7
p48
aVNote that u'\u005cu03a6' h , u'\u005cu03a6' m , u'\u005cu03a6' h , m , and u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m are typically very sparse for each word or arc
p49
aVWe denote each element of the tensor as A i , j , k where i u'\u005cu2208' [ n ] , j u'\u005cu2208' [ n ] , k u'\u005cu2208' [ d ] and [ n ] is a shorthand for the set of integers { 1 , 2 , u'\u005cu22ef' , n }
p50
aVWe should note that since our model parameter A is represented and learned in the low-rank form, we only have to store and maintain the low-rank projections U u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h , V u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' m and W u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h , m rather than explicitly calculate the feature tensor u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2297' u'\u005cu03a6' m u'\u005cu2297' u'\u005cu03a6' h , m
p51
aVSpecifically, we define the arc score s u'\u005cu0393' ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) as the combination
p52
aVWe can therefore create a tensor representation of u'\u005cu0398' such that B i , j , k equals the corresponding parameter value in u'\u005cu0398'
p53
aVIn an online learning setup, we update parameters successively based on each sentence
p54
aVThe alternating online algorithm relies on how we initialize U , V , and W since each update is carried out in the context of the other two
p55
aVFirst, we test our model by varying the hyper-parameter u'\u005cu0393' which balances the tensor score and the traditional MST/Turbo score components
p56
aVThe objective as stated is not jointly convex with respect to U , V and W due to our explicit representation of the low-rank tensor
p57
aVAs a result, the arc score for the tensor reduces to evaluating U u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h , V u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' m , and W u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h , m which are all r dimensional vectors and can be computed efficiently based on any sparse vectors u'\u005cu03a6' h , u'\u005cu03a6' m , and u'\u005cu03a6' h , m
p58
aVTheir orientation is defined based on usage
p59
aVWe begin by training our model without any low-rank parameters, and obtain parameters u'\u005cu0398'
p60
aVSimilarly, V u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' m provides an analogous representation for a modifier m
p61
aVA random initialization of these parameters is unlikely to work well, both due to the dimensions involved, and the nature of the alternating updates
p62
aVFor example, u u'\u005cu2297' v is a rank-1 matrix u u'\u005cu2062' v T when u and v are column vectors ( u T u'\u005cu2062' v if they are row vectors
p63
aVWe define the inner product of two tensors (or matrices) as u'\u005cu27e8' A , B u'\u005cu27e9' = vec u'\u005cu2062' ( A ) T u'\u005cu2062' vec u'\u005cu2062' ( B ) , where vec u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) concatenates the tensor (or matrix) elements into a column vector
p64
aVwhere u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' L , U u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × n , V u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × n , and W u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × d are the model parameters to be learned
p65
aVIndeed, recent approaches to matrix problems decompose the parameter matrix as a sum of low-rank and sparse matrices [ 40 , 47 ]
p66
aVAs a result, the objective will be jointly convex with respect to u'\u005cu0398' and U and could be optimized using standard tools
p67
aV2 2 Note that in the case of high-order parsing, the sum S u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) may also include local scores for other syntactic structures, such as grandhead-head-modifier score s ( g u'\u005cu2192' h u'\u005cu2192' m
p68
aVWe use a low-rank version of B as the initialization
p69
aVHowever, if we fix any two sets of parameters, for example, if we fix V and W , then the combined score S u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) will be a linear function of both u'\u005cu0398' and U
p70
aVSpecifically, we unfold the tensor B into a matrix B ( h ) of dimensions n and n u'\u005cu2062' d , where n = d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu03a6' h ) = d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu03a6' m ) and d = d u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu03a6' h , m
p71
aVIf the arc has not been seen in the available training data, it does not contribute to the traditional arc score s u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5'
p72
aVFor instance, a rank-1 tensor can be unfolded as u u'\u005cu2297' v u'\u005cu2297' w = u u'\u005cu2297' vec u'\u005cu2062' ( v u'\u005cu2297' w
p73
aVThis is possible since the objective function with respect to ( u'\u005cu0398' , U ) has a similar form as in the original passive-aggressive algorithm
p74
aVWhen u'\u005cu0393' = 0 , the arc scores are entirely based on the low-rank tensor and u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0398' = 0
p75
aVWe consider here instead a reasonable deterministic u'\u005cu201c' guess u'\u005cu201d' as the initialization method
p76
aVFollowing standard practices, we train our full model and the baselines for 10 epochs
p77
aVWe then obtain parameter increments u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0398' and u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' U by solving
p78
aVLow-rank constraints are commonly used for improving generalization [ 19 , 37 , 38 , 12 ]
p79
aVTherefore d u'\u005cu2062' u and d u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0398' are also sparse and can be computed efficiently
p80
aVWe compute the top-r SVD of the resulting unfolded matrix such that B ( h ) = P T u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' Q
p81
aVAs the evaluation measure, we use unlabeled attachment scores (UAS) excluding punctuation
p82
aVThe constraints serve to separate the gold tree from other alternatives in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ^ i ) with a margin that increases with distance
p83
aVThe predicted parse is obtained as y ^ = arg u'\u005cu2062' max y u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) u'\u005cu2061' S u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y )
p84
aVEnglish has 50 dimensional word vectors, while German and Swedish have 25 dimensional word vectors
p85
aVTo assess the ability of our model to incorporate a range of features, we add unsupervised word vectors to our model
p86
aVWhile this method learns to map word combinations into vectors, it builds on existing word-level vector representations
p87
aVFor the arc feature vector u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m , we use the same set of feature templates as MST v0.5.1
p88
aVFirst, features may lack clear linguistic interpretation as in distributional features or continuous vector embeddings of words
p89
aVOur parameters are divided into a sparse set corresponding to manually chosen MST or Turbo parser features and a larger set governed by a low-rank tensor
p90
aVAnother application of word vectors is compositional vector grammar [ 36 ]
p91
aVWe obtain role-dependent low-dimensional representations for words (head, modifier) that are specifically tailored for parsing accuracy, and use standard online algorithms for optimizing the low-rank tensor components
p92
aVOur low dimensional embeddings are tailored to the syntactic context of words (head, modifier
p93
aVFor this purpose, we train a model with only a tensor component (such that it has to learn an accurate tensor) on the English dataset and obtain low dimensional embeddings U u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' w and V u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' w for each word
p94
aVUnlike parsers such as MST, we can easily benefit from auxiliary information (e.g.,, word vectors) appended as features
p95
aVFinally, we demonstrate that the model can successfully leverage word vector representations, in contrast to the baselines
p96
aVThese feature selection methods are particularly promising in parsing scenarios where the optimal feature set is likely to be a small subset of the original set of candidate features
p97
aVOur parsing model aims to combine the strengths of both traditional features from the MST/Turbo parser as well as the new low-rank tensor features
p98
aVThe exploding dimensionality of rich feature vectors must then be balanced with the difficulty of effectively learning the associated parameters from limited training data
p99
aVIn contrast, assume we take the cross-product of the auxiliary word vector values, POS tags and lexical items of a word and its context, and add the crossed values into a normal model (in u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m
p100
aVWe compare our model to MST and Turbo parsers on non-projective dependency parsing
p101
aV3 , for parsing performance
p102
aVTraditionally, parsing research has focused on modeling the direct connection between the features and the predicted syntactic relations such as head-modifier (arc) relations in dependency parsing
p103
aVDiscrete features, and their cross products, can be further complemented with auxiliary information about words participating in an arc, such as continuous vector representations of words
p104
aVWe expect a dependency parsing model to benefit from several aspects of the low-rank tensor scoring
p105
aVIndeed, in the full English training set of CoNLL-2008, the tensor involves around 8 × 10 11 entries while the MST feature vector has approximately 1.5 × 10 7 features
p106
aVFor head/modifier vector u'\u005cu03a6' h and u'\u005cu03a6' m , we show the complete set of feature templates used by our model in Table 1
p107
aVIn our implementation, we run one epoch of our model without low-rank parameters and initialize the tensor A
p108
aVSecond, designing a small subset of templates (and features) is challenging when the relevant linguistic information is distributed across the features
p109
aVNote that the vectors u , v , and w may be column or row vectors
p110
aVOur model outperforms Turbo parser, MST parser, as well as its own variants without the tensor component
p111
aVHere u'\u005cu03a6' h , m is much lower dimensional than the MST arc feature vector u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m discussed earlier
p112
aVThe explicit representation sidesteps inherent complexity problems associated with the tensor rank [ 14 ]
p113
aVBy explicitly representing the tensor in a low-rank form, we have direct control over the effective dimensionality of the set of parameters
p114
aVTo counter this feature explosion, we restrict the parameters A to have low rank
p115
aVwhere the adjustable parameters A also form a tensor
p116
aVThe improvement on the overall parsing performance was marginal
p117
aVGiven the typical dimensions of the component feature vectors, u'\u005cu03a6' h , u'\u005cu03a6' m , u'\u005cu03a6' h , m , it is not even possible to store all the parameters in A
p118
aVWe follow this decomposition while extending the parameter matrix into a tensor
p119
aVFollowing the MST parser [ 27 ] we can define rich features characterizing each head-modifier arc, compiled into a sparse binary vector u'\u005cu03a6' h u'\u005cu2192' m u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' L that depends on the sentence x as well as the chosen arc h u'\u005cu2192' m (again, we suppress the dependence on x
p120
aVThe updates also illustrate how u'\u005cu0393' balances the effect of the MST component of the score relative to the low-rank tensor score
p121
aVIn this way, our model is able to capture a wide range of information including the auxiliary features without having uncontrolled feature explosion, while still having the full accessibility to the manually engineered features that are proven useful
p122
aVRather than assuming that each parameter can be set independently of others, it is helpful to assume that the parameters vary in a low dimensional subspace that has to be estimated together with the parameters
p123
aVThree languages in our dataset u'\u005cu2013' English, German and Swedish u'\u005cu2013' have corresponding word vectors in this collection
p124
aVEven in the case of first-order parsers, this results in a high-dimensional vector representation of each arc
p125
aVA predominant way to counter the high dimensionality of features is to manually design or select a meaningful set of feature templates, which are used to generate different types of features [ 27 , 16 , 22 ]
p126
aVIn contrast, with the low-rank constraint, the arc score in Eq
p127
aVIn this sense, the rank-1 tensor represents a substantial feature expansion
p128
aVThe leading left and right singular vectors of this matrix are assigned to V u'\u005cu2062' ( i and W u'\u005cu2062' ( i respectively
p129
aVTable 6 illustrates the impact of estimating low-rank tensor parameters on the running time of the algorithm
p130
aVWe next focus on the first-order model and gauge the impact of the tensor component
p131
aVWe implement the low-rank factorization model in the context of first- and third-order dependency parsing
p132
aVHowever, the tensor scoring component achieves better generalization on the test data, resulting in better UAS than NT-1st after 8 training epochs
p133
aVTraditionally, these vector representations have been derived primarily from co-occurrences of words within sentences, ignoring syntactic roles of the co-occurring words
p134
aVWhen training with the tensor component alone ( u'\u005cu0393' = 0 ), the model converges more slowly
p135
aVIn terms of the parameter matrix, this corresponds to a low-rank assumption
p136
aVTable 2 shows the performance of our model and the baselines on 14 CoNLL datasets
p137
aVOther possible features include, for example, the label of the arc h u'\u005cu2192' m , the POS tags between the head and the modifier, boolean flags which indicate the occurence of in-between punctutations or conjunctions, etc u'\u005cu03a6' h and u'\u005cu03a6' m , on the other hand, are built from features shown in Table 1
p138
aVFor our parser, we train both a first-order parsing model (as described in Section 3 and 4) as well as a third-order model
p139
aVThe number of features for each arc would be at least quadratic, growing into thousands, and would be a significant impediment to parsing efficiency
p140
aVHowever, to accelerate learning, we adopt an online learning setup
p141
aVOur technique, in contrast, is suitable for cases where the relevant information is distributed across a larger set of related features
p142
aVThe rationale is that given all other features, the model would induce representations that play a similar role to POS tags
p143
aVWe can represent a rank-r tensor A explicitly in terms of parameter matrices U , V , and W as shown in Eq
p144
aVFollowing standard practices, we encode this information as features
p145
aVThe third order parser simply adds high-order features, those typically used in MST and Turbo parsers, into our s u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) = u'\u005cu27e8' u'\u005cu0398' , u'\u005cu03a6' u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) u'\u005cu27e9' scoring component
p146
aVFinally, W u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu03a6' h , m is a vector embedding of the supplemental arc-dependent information
p147
aVSimilarly, we use M i , j and u i to represent the elements of matrix M and vector u , respectively
p148
aVThe bottom part of Table 5 shows that the neighbors change substantially depending on the syntactic role of the word
p149
aVSpecifically, we use the passive-aggressive learning algorithm [ 9 ] tailored to our setting, updating pairs of parameter sets, ( u'\u005cu0398' , U ) , ( u'\u005cu0398' , V ) and ( u'\u005cu0398' , W ) in an alternating manner
p150
aVFor instance, morphological properties are closely tied to part-of-speech tags, which in turn relate to positional features
p151
aVWe use this vector to calculate the cosine similarity between words
p152
aVNote that the performance of traditional parsers drops when tags are not provided
p153
aVWe can see that the improvement of adding the low-rank tensor is consistent across various choices of hyper parameter u'\u005cu0393'
p154
aVIn all the reported experiments, the hyper-parameters are set as follows r = 50 (rank of the tensor), C = 1 for first-order model and C = 0.01 for third-order model
p155
aVA great deal of parsing research has been dedicated to feature engineering [ 18 , 25 , 26 ]
p156
aVThese datasets include manually annotated dependency trees, POS tags and morphological information
p157
aVThe Kronecker product of three vectors is denoted by u u'\u005cu2297' v u'\u005cu2297' w and forms a rank-1 tensor such that
p158
aVThe low-rank parser achieves average performance of 89.08% across 14 languages, compared to 88.73% for the Turbo parser, and 87.19% for MST
p159
aV4 4 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mstparser/ In addition, we implemented two additional baselines, NT-1st (first order) and NT-3rd (third order), corresponding to our model without the tensor component
p160
aVFinding an expressive representation of input sentences is crucial for accurate parsing
p161
aVSyntactic relations manifest themselves in a broad range of surface indicators, ranging from morphological to lexical, including positional and part-of-speech (POS) tagging features
p162
aVThe arc score s t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) associated with the tensor representation is defined analogously as
p163
aVEach right singular vector S i u'\u005cu2062' Q u'\u005cu2062' ( i is also a matrix in u'\u005cu211d' n × d

aVTensors are multi-way generalizations of matrices and possess an analogous notion of rank
p165
aVIn fact, it nearly reaches the performance of the original parser that used the tags on English
p166
aVTo counter this effect, we use parameter averaging as used in the MST and Turbo parsers
p167
aVFor the MST parser, we train and test using the most recent version of the code
p168
aVA lot of recent work has been done on mapping words into vector spaces [ 8 , 41 , 11 , 30 ]
p169
aVLet x be a sentence and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) the set of possible dependency trees over the words in x
p170
aVFor example, the closest words to the word u'\u005cu201c' increase u'\u005cu201d' are verbs in the context phrase u'\u005cu201c' will increase again u'\u005cu201d' , while the closest words become nouns given a different phrase u'\u005cu201c' an increase of u'\u005cu201d'
p171
aVFor instance, on the English dataset, the low-rank model trained without POS tags achieves 90.49% on first-order parsing, while the baseline gets 86.70% if trained under the same conditions, and 90.58% if trained with 12 core POS tags
p172
aVIn order to apply the passive-aggressive algorithm, we fix two of U , V and W (say, for example, V and W ) in an alternating manner, and apply a closed-form update to the remaining parameters (here U and u'\u005cu0398'
p173
aVFor instance, we obtain more than 0.5% absolute improvement on Swedish
p174
aVThe goal is to learn values for the parameters u'\u005cu0398' , U , V and W that optimize the combined scoring function S u'\u005cu0393' ( x , y ) = u'\u005cu2211' h u'\u005cu2192' m u'\u005cu2208' y s u'\u005cu0393' ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) , defined in Eq
p175
aVFor example, x u'\u005cu2062' ( h ) is the word corresponding to h
p176
aVWe assume that the score S u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) of each candidate dependency tree y u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) decomposes into a sum of u'\u005cu201c' local u'\u005cu201d' scores for arcs
p177
aVwhere h u'\u005cu2192' m is the head-modifier dependency arc in the tree y
p178
aVWe adopt a maximum soft-margin framework for this learning problem
p179
aVWhile in most state-of-the-art parsers, features are selected manually [ 27 , 29 , 16 , 22 , 44 , 35 ] , automatic feature selection methods are gaining popularity [ 23 , 1 , 31 , 2 ]
p180
aVFor the Turbo parser, we directly compare with the recent published results in [ 22 ]
p181
aVThe model was evaluated on 14 languages, using dependency data from CoNLL 2008 and CoNLL 2006
p182
aVThe improvements of our low-rank model are consistent across languages results for the first order parser are better on 11 out of 14 languages
p183
aVFor example, the performance gap is 10% on German
p184
aVFigure 1 shows the average UAS on CoNLL test datasets after each training epoch
p185
aVWe say that tensor A is in Kruskal form if
p186
aVTable 5 shows examples of five closest neighbors of queried words
p187
aVThe rank r and u'\u005cu0393' u'\u005cu2208' [ 0 , 1 ] (balancing the two scores) represent hyper-parameters in our model
p188
aVFor example, u'\u005cu03a6' h , m may be composed of only indicators for binned arc lengths 3 3 In our current version, u'\u005cu03a6' h , m only contains the binned arc length
p189
aVSpecifically, we find parameters u'\u005cu0398' , U , V , W , and { u'\u005cu039e' i } that minimize
p190
aVNevertheless, any such word-level representation can be used to offset inherent sparsity problems associated with full lexicalization [ 5 ]
p191
aVOur model also achieves the best UAS on 5 languages
p192
aVThe final parameters are those averaged across all the iterations (cf
p193
aVSpecifically
p194
aVWe test our dependency model on 14 languages, including the English dataset from CoNLL 2008 shared tasks and all 13 datasets from CoNLL 2006 shared tasks [ 3 , 39 ]
p195
aVTo illustrate this, consider a training sentence x i
p196
aVA key problem is how we parameterize the arc scores s ( h u'\u005cu2192' m
p197
aVOur experiments show that low-rank parser operates effectively in the absence of tags
p198
aVBy varying C , we can determine an appropriate step size for the online updates
p199
aVIn particular, the low-rank constraint can help generalize to unseen arcs
p200
aVThe magnitude of change of u'\u005cu0398' and U is controlled by the parameter C
p201
aVMore interestingly, we can consider the impact of syntactic context on the derived projections
p202
aVIn this way, the optimization problem attempts to keep the parameter change as small as possible, while forcing it to achieve mostly zero loss on this single instance
p203
aVThe resulting arc score s t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) is then
p204
aVWe compare our results against the MST [ 27 ] and Turbo [ 22 ] parsers
p205
aVWe manually analyze low-dimensional projections to assess whether they capture syntactic abstraction
p206
aVConsider a feature u'\u005cu0394' ( x ( h ) = a ) u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu0394' ( x ( m ) = b ) u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu0394' ( d i s ( x , h , m ) = c ) which is non-zero only for an arc a u'\u005cu2192' b with distance c in sentence x
p207
aVThe power of the low-rank model becomes evident in the absence of any part-of-speech tags
p208
aVLet A u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n × n × d be a 3-dimensional tensor (a 3-way array
p209
aV5 5 https://github.com/wolet/sprml13-word-embeddings The dimensionality of this representation varies by language
p210
aVIn this sense they perform a role similar to POS tags
p211
aVWhile these lists include some noise, we can clearly see that the neighbors exhibit similar syntactic behavior

p213
aVThe Arabic dataset has the longest average sentence length, while the Chinese dataset has the shortest sentence length in CoNLL 2006
p214
aVThe passive-aggressive algorithm regularizes the increments (e.g., u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0398' and u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' U ) during each update but does not include any overall regularization
p215
aVFor simplicity, in our algorithm we average U , V , W and u'\u005cu0398' separately, which works well empirically
p216
aVThe training set D = { ( x ^ i , y ^ i ) } i = 1 N consists of N pairs, where each pair consists of a sentence x i and the corresponding gold (target) parse y i
p217
aVwhere U , V u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × n , W u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' r × d and U u'\u005cu2062' ( i is the i t u'\u005cu2062' h row of matrix U

aVThis method is described below

aVSee [ 22 ] for a complete list of these structures
p220
aVwhere u'\u005cu2225' y ^ i - y i u'\u005cu2225' 1 is the number of mismatched arcs between the two trees, and u'\u005cu039e' i is a non-negative slack variable
p221
aVFor example, s ( h u'\u005cu2192' m ) can depend on x in complicated ways as discussed below
p222
aVThis problem has a closed form solution
p223
aVA strict low-rank assumption can be restrictive
p224
aVWe suppress the dependence on x whenever it is clear from context

aVFor example, u'\u005cu201c' on u'\u005cu201d' is close to other prepositions
p227
aVThe update involves finding first the best competing tree
