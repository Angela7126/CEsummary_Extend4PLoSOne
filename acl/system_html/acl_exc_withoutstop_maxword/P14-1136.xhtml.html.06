<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We performed initial experiments using context extracted from 1) direct dependents, 2) dependency paths, and 3) both</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus for this context function, the block cardinality k was the sum of the number of scanned gold dependency path types and the number of dependency labels</a>
