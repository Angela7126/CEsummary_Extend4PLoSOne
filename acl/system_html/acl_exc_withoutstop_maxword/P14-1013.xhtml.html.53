<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We directly optimized bilingual topic similarity in the deep learning framework with the help of sentence-level parallel data, so that the learned representation could be easily used in SMT decoding procedure</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, it helps to train a smarter translation model with the embedded topic information</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is not simply coincidence since we can interpret their approach as a special case in our neural network method when a parallel sentence pair has document-level information, that document will be retrieved for training; otherwise, the most relevant document will be retrieved from the monolingual data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results confirm that topic information is indispensable for SMT since both [ 34 ] and our neural network based method significantly outperforms the baseline system</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since a parallel sentence pair should have the same topic, our goal is to maximize the similarity score between the source sentence and target sentence</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>By measuring the similarity between the source texts and bilingual translation rules, the SMT decoder is able to encourage topic relevant translation candidates and penalize topic irrelevant candidates</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Irrelevant documents bring so many unrelated topic words hence degrade neural network learning performance</a>
