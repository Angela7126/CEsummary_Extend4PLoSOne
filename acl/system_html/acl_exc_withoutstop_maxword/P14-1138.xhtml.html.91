<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the lookup layer, each of these words is converted to its word embedding, and then the concatenation of the two embeddings ( x j ) is fed to the hidden layer in the same manner as the FFNN-based model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The proposed RNN produces a single score that is constructed in the hidden layer by employing the distance-dependent weight matrices</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Under the recurrence, the proposed model compactly encodes the entire history of previous alignments in the hidden layer configuration y i</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As described above, the RNN-based model has a hidden layer with recurrent connections</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, the lookup layer converts each input word into its word embedding by looking up its corresponding column in the embedding matrix ( L ), and then concatenates them</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, the proposed model can find alignments by taking advantage of the long alignment history, while the FFNN-based model considers only the last alignment</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Viterbi alignment is determined using the Viterbi algorithm, similar to the FFNN-based model, where the model is sequentially applied from f 1 to f</a>
