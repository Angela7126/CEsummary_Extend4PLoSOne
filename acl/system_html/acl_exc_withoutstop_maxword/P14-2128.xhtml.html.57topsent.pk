VOur method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations
p1
aVSuch properties are used as additional features to guide the parser to construct the dependency graph
p2
aVMoreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations
p3
aVNote that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account
p4
aVConsequently, punctuations are not as consistently annotated in treebanks as words, making it harder to parse punctuations
p5
aVIn such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary
p6
aVThe result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing
