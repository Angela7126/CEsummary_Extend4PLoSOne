VWe then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora
p1
aVWe chose the balanced corpora where the standard approach has shown the best results in the previous experiment, namely [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] and [ diabetes corpus 7 ]
p2
aVSince the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes
p3
aVOverall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [ breast cancer corpus 1 ] , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [ diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14 ] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which
