<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But it is clear that the majority of changes are rewrites; thus revisions on the arXiv indeed provide a great source for potential strength differences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Many differences between these versions constitute a source of valid and motivated strength differences, as can be seen from the sentential revisions in Table 1</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The main contribution of this work is to provide the first large-scale corpus of sentence-level revisions for studying a broad range of variations in statement strength</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As strength is inherently relative, it is natural to look at revisions that change statement strength, which we refer to as u'\u201c' strength</a>
