VBased on the results obtained by , who showed that the keyword method results in better long-term word retention than rote memorization, we would expect the error rate reduction to be even higher in a delayed post-test
p1
aVInterestingly, there is a strong correlation (Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s r = 0.85 ) between the difficulty of the words in each group (measured as the error rate on rote memorization) and the positive contribution of the generated sentences to the learning process
p2
aVFinally, the relative error rate reduction % e is calculated as the the ratio between the absolute error rate reduction u'\u005cu0394' u'\u005cu2062' e and the error rate of rote memorization e R , i.e
p3
aVSimilarly, groups A2 and B1 are of average difficulty, whereas group B2 appears to be the most difficult, with an error rate higher than 22% when using only rote memorization
p4
aVIn fact, we can see how the relative error rate reduction % e increases from
