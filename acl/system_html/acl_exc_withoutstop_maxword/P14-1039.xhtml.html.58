<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar u'\u2019' s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model u'\u2019' s BLEU score of 87.93</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer u'\u2019' s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the averaged perceptron algorithm [ 8 ] , White Rajkumar [ 35 ] trained a structured prediction ranking model to combine these existing syntactic models with several n -gram language models</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, to develop a more nuanced self-monitoring reranker that is more robust to such parsing mistakes, we trained an SVM using dependency precision and recall features for all three parses, their n -best parsing results, and per-label precision and recall for each type of dependency, together with the realizer u'\u2019' s normalized perceptron model score as a feature</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Rajkumar White [ 28 , 36 ] have recently shown that some rather egregious surface realization errors u'\u2014' in the sense that the reader would likely end up with the wrong interpretation u'\u2014' can be avoided by making use of features inspired by psycholinguistics research together with an otherwise state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model [ 35 ] , as reviewed in the next section</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Rajkumar White u'\u2019' s experiments confirmed the efficacy of the features based on Jaeger u'\u2019' s work, including information density u'\u2013' based features, in a local classification model</a>
