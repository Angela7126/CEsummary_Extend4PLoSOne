VIn DA terms, since the vocabularies of the source and target domains are usually different, word representations would mitigate the lexical sparsity by providing general features of words that are shared across domains, hence bridge the gap between domains
p1
aVHowever, in domain cts, the improvement that word embeddings provide for word clusters is modest
p2
aVWe consider two types of word representations and use them as additional features in our DA system, namely Brown word clustering [
