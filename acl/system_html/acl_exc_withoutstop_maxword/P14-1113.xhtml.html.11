<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The hierarchies are represented as relations of pairwise words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have made similar obsevation that about a half of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations are absent in a Chinese semantic thesaurus</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, we extract words in the second, third and fifth levels to constitute hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym pairs (left panel, Figure 3</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Figure 3 shows that the word u'\u201c' dragonfly u'\u201d' in the fifth level has two hypernyms u'\u201c' insect u'\u201d' in the third level and u'\u201c' animal u'\u201d' in the second level</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Several other methods are based on lexical patterns</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>
