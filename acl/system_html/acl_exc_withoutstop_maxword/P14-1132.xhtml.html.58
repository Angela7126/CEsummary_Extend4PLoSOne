<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v u'\u2192' w</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Most importantly, by projecting visual representations of objects into a shared semantic space , we do not limit ourselves to establishing a link between objects and words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, this function, given a visual vector, returns its corresponding linguistic representation</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Furthermore, since not all new concepts in the linguistic environment refer to new objects (they might denote abstract concepts or out-of-scene objects), it seems more reasonable for the learner to be more alerted to linguistic cues about a recently-spotted new object than vice versa</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>During training, this cross-modal vocabulary is used to induce a projection function (Section 4.4 ), which u'\u2013' intuitively u'\u2013' represents a mapping between visual and linguistic dimensions</a>
