VWe propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions
p1
aVIf constraints u'\u005cu2019' weights are close together, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate u'\u005cu2019' s probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation
p2
aVWeights are always negative in OT; a constraint violation can never make a candidate more likely to win.) For a given input-candidate pair ( x , y ) , f i u'\u005cu2062' ( y , x ) is the number of violations of constraint C i by the pair

aVThe goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w
