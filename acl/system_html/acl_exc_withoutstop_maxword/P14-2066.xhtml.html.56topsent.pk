VParticipants were then asked to choose labels and write mandatory comments for 50 pairs

aVAccording to the comments written by participants, we believe that they did the labeling in good faith
p3
aVThe instructions included 8 pairs as examples and 10 pairs to label as a training exercise
p4
aVThe main contribution of this work is to provide the first large-scale corpus of sentence-level revisions for studying a broad range of variations in statement strength
p5
aVMany differences between these versions constitute a source of valid and motivated strength differences, as can be seen from the sentential revisions in Table 1
p6
aVAs strength is inherently relative, it is natural to
