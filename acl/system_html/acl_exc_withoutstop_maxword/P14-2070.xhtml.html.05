<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The quest for a high precision and high coverage lexicon, where words are associated with either sentiment or emotion scores, has several reasons</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this work, we aim at automatically producing a high coverage and high precision emotion lexicon using distributional semantics, with numerical scores associated with each emotion, like it has already been done for sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Compared to sentiment lexica, far less emotion lexica have been produced, and all have lower coverage</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>More recently, a resource that replicated ANEW annotation approach using crowd-sourcing, was released [] , providing sentiment scores for 14k words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In Table 5 we report the coverage of some Sentiment and Emotion Lexica of different sizes on the same dataset</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Interestingly, this resource annotates the most frequent words in English, so, even if lexicon coverage is still far lower than SWN-prior, it grants a high coverage, with human precision, of language use</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Another widely used resource is ANEW [] , providing valence scores for 1k words, which were manually assigned</a>
