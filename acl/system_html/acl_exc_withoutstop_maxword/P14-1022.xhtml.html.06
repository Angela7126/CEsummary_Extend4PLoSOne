<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar, what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We exploit this by adding an additional feature template similar to our span shape feature from Section 4.4 which uses the (deterministic) tag for each word as its descriptor</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser u'\u2019' s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We add one final feature characterizing the span, which we call span shape</a>
