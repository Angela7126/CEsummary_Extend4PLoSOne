VThen we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features
p1
aVFor a feature u'\u005cu0391' belonging to a template F , with probability p we will draw a noise feature u'\u005cu0392' also belonging to F , according to some distribution q
p2
aVWe can exploit this structure by using an alternative dropout scheme for each token, choose exactly one feature template to keep, and zero out all other features that consider this token (transition feature templates such as u'\u005cu27e8' y t , y t - 1 u'\u005cu27e9' are not considered for dropout
p3
aVIf we define the scatter matrix of the uncorrupted input as
