<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The model must learn the markedness constraints * \textipa I and Harmony , as well as the weights for all four constraints</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Unlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these constraints, the IBPOT learns constraint violation profiles and weights for them simultaneously</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Outputs \textipa Ete and \textipa etE violate both Harmony (weight 16) and Parse [atr] (weight 8), so their scores are 24</a>
