VFurthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] , in which questions of efficiency are paramount due to the larger problems involved; however, these approaches largely restrict compression to pruning parse trees, thereby imposing a dependency on parser performance

aVIn order to produce a solution to this subproblem, we use an LP relaxation of the relevant portion of the ILP from Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) by omitting integer constraints over the token and dependency variables in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' respectively
