<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Patterns specify whether verbs should be included in their lexical form or as they appear in the source text</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The patterns are designed to match only the arguments used as part of the question or the answer, in order to prevent over generation of questions</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As these patterns are matched, they will be rejected as candidates for generation for a particular sentence if the required arguments are absent or if filter conditions are present</a>
