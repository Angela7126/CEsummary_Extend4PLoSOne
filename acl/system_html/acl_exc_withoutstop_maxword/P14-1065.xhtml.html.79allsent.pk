(lp0
VNote that the Asiya metrics are combinations of several metrics, and these combinations (which exclude DR and DR- lex ) can be also tuned; this yields sizable improvements over the untuned versions as column three in the table shows
p1
aVIn this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored
p2
aVFurthermore, when combined with individual metrics in group II, DR- lex is able to improve consistently over each one of them
p3
aVAgain, DR- lex is better than DR; with a positive Tau of +.133, yet as an individual metric, it ranks poorly compared to other metrics in group II
p4
aVAs an example, consider the three discourse trees (DTs) shown in Figure 4 a ) for a reference (human) translation, and ( b ) and ( c ) for translations of two different systems on the WMT12 test dataset
p5
aVIndividually, DR- lex outperforms most of the metrics from group II, and ranks as the second best metric in that group
p6
aVThis suggests that both DR and DR- lex contain information that is complementary to that of the individual metrics that we experimented with
p7
aVHowever, over all metrics and all language pairs, DR- lex is able to obtain an average improvement in correlation of +.035, which is remarkably higher than that of DR
p8
aVTo do so, we contrast different MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse information
p9
aVOur working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems
p10
aVThus, we can conclude that at the system-level, adding discourse information to a metric, even using the simplest of the combination schemes, is a good idea for most of the metrics, and can help to significantly improve the correlation with human judgments
p11
aVCompared to the previous work, ( i )  we use a different discourse representation (RST), ( ii )  we compare discourse parses using all-subtree kernels [] , ( iii )  we evaluate on much larger datasets, for several language pairs and for multiple metrics, and ( iv )  we do demonstrate better correlation with human judgments
p12
aVInterestingly, the tuned combinations that include the much weaker metric DR now improve over 12 out of 13 of the individual metrics in groups II and III, and only slightly degrades the score of the 13th one ( spede07pP
p13
aVDue to the low score of DR as an individual metric, it fails to yield improvements when uniformly combined with other metrics
p14
aVThe individual metrics combined in Asiya- all can be naturally categorized according to the type of linguistic information they use to compute the quality scores
p15
aV6 6 In Asiya the metrics from this family are referred to as u'\u005cu201c' Discourse Representation u'\u005cu201d' metrics
p16
aVCombination of two metrics variants based on semantic parsing
p17
aVThese metrics tasks are based on sentence-level evaluation, which arguably can limit the benefits of using global discourse properties
p18
aVSince the metrics that participated in WMT11 and WMT12 are different (and even when they have the same name, there is no guarantee that they have not changed from 2011 to 2012), we only report results for the versions of NIST, Rouge , TER, and BLEU available in Asiya , as well as for the Asiya metrics, thus ensuring that the metrics in the experiments are consistent for 2011 and 2012
p19
aVOverall, from the experimental results in this section, we can conclude that discourse structure is an important information source to be taken into account in the automatic evaluation of machine translation output
p20
aVAs in previous sections we present the average results over all four language pairs
p21
aVAs shown in Figure 7 , DR does not include any lexical item, and therefore measures the similarity between two translations in terms of their discourse structures only
p22
aVThe field of automatic evaluation metrics for MT is very active, and new metrics are continuously being proposed, especially in the context of the evaluation campaigns that run as part of the Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2008-2012), and NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge (MetricsMATR), among others
p23
aVFor example, at WMT12, 12 metrics were compared [] , most of them new
p24
aVAs in the WMT12 experimental setup, we use these rankings to calculate correlation with human judgments at the sentence-level, i.e., Kendall u'\u005cu2019' s Tau; see [] for details
p25
aVThis is remarkable given that DR has a strong negative Tau as an individual metric at the sentence-level
p26
aVFortunately, several sentences are long and complex enough to present rich discourse structures connecting their basic clauses
p27
aVA common argument, is that current automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU are inadequate to capture discourse-related aspects of translation quality [ 5 ]
p28
aVThus, there is consensus that discourse-informed MT evaluation metrics are needed in order to advance research in this direction
p29
aVThe results are shown in Table 4
p30
aVAnnotators rank the output of five systems according to perceived translation quality
p31
aV2010 ) , which use the Discourse Representation Theory [] and tree-based discourse representation structures (DRS) produced by a semantic parser
p32
aVIn order to use the WMT12 data for training a learning-to-rank model, we transformed the five-way relative rankings into ten pairwise comparisons
p33
aVConversely, ties and incomplete discourse analysis were not a problem at the system-level, where evidence from all 3,003 test sentences is aggregated, and allows to rank systems more precisely
p34
aVFor clarity, we will refer to them as semantic parsing metrics u'\u005cu2018' DR-Or(*) u'\u005cu2019' and u'\u005cu2018' DR-Orp(*) u'\u005cu2019'
p35
aVFor cross-validation in WMT12, we used ten folds of approximately equal sizes, each containing about 300 sentences we constructed the folds by putting together entire documents, thus not allowing sentences from a document to be split over two different folds
p36
aVHowever, the structures they consider are actually very different from the discourse structures exploited in this paper
p37
aVUnlike PRO, ( i )  we use human judgments , not automatic scores, and ( ii )  we train on all pairs , not on a subsample
p38
aVCombination of three metric variants based on predicate argument structures (semantic role labeling u'\u005cu2018' SR-Mr(*) u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' SR-Or(*) u'\u005cu2019' , and u'\u005cu2018' SR-Or u'\u005cu2019'
p39
aVAsiya- lex
p40
aVGroup I contains our evaluation metrics, DR and DR- lex
p41
aVThis shows that the weights learned on WMT12 generalize well, as they are also good for WMT11
p42
aVAs expected, DR- lex performs better than DR since it is lexicalized (at the unigram level), and also gives partial credit to correct structures
p43
aVThus, in a coherent text, discourse units (sentences or clauses) are logically connected the meaning of a unit relates to that of the previous and the following units
p44
aVRecently, there have been two promising research directions for improving SMT and its evaluation a )  by using more structured linguistic information, such as syntax [] , hierarchical structures [] , and semantic roles [] , and ( b )  by going beyond the sentence-level, e.g.,, translating at the document level []
p45
aVDiscourse units linked by a relation are further distinguished based on their relative importance in the text nuclei are the core parts of the relation while satellites are supportive ones
p46
aVThis made TerrorCat u'\u005cu2019' s score negative, as we present it in Table 3
p47
aVThe organizers relied on a random selection of systems, and a large number of comparisons between pairs of them, to make comparisons across systems feasible []
p48
aVBelow we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex
p49
aVNote that sentences can be made of several clauses, which in turn can be interrelated through the same logical relations
p50
aVIn order to allow the tree kernel to find subtree matches at the word level, we include an additional layer of dummy leaves as was done in [] ; not shown in Figure 7 , for simplicity
p51
aVThey calculate the similarity between the MT output and references based on DRS subtree matching, as defined in [ 7 ] , DRS lexical overlap, and DRS morpho-syntactic overlap
p52
aVFrom its foundations, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) had two defining characteristics first, translation was modeled as a generative process at the sentence-level
p53
aVNote that the nuclearity and relation labels in the reference translation are also realized in the system translation in (b), but not in (c), which makes (b) a better translation compared to (c), according to our hypothesis
p54
aVWe can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III
p55
aVThus, although limited, this setting is able to demonstrate the potential of discourse-level information for MT evaluation
p56
aVIn particular, we believe that good translations should tend to preserve discourse relations
p57
aVAdding DR and DR- lex to the combinations manages to improve over five and four of the six tuned Asiya metrics, respectively
p58
aVThe logical relationship between sentences carries important information that allows the text to express a meaning as a whole beyond the sum of its separate parts
p59
aVTo determine the relative weights for the tuned combinations, we followed a similar approach to the one used by PRO to tune the relative weights of the components of a log-linear SMT model [] , also using Maximum Entropy as the base learning algorithm
p60
aVSecond, it was purely statistical over words or word sequences and made little to no use of linguistic information
p61
aVFurthermore, we also present overall results for i ) the average score over all metrics, excluding DR and DR- lex , and ( ii ) the differences in the correlations for the DR/DR- lex -combined and the original metrics
p62
aVFor each metric in groups II, III and IV, we present the results for the original metric as well for the linear interpolation of that metric with DR and with DR- lex
p63
aVThe uniform linear combination of the previous 7 individual metrics plus the 12 from Asiya- 0809 is reported as Asiya- all in the experimental section
p64
aVHowever, they could not improve correlation with human judgments, as evaluated on the MetricsMATR dataset
p65
aVFor instance, if a judge ranked the output of systems A , B , C , D , E as A B C D E , this would entail that A B , A C , A D and A E , etc
p66
aVAs a result, for each source sentence, only relative rankings were available
p67
aVGroup II includes the metrics that participated in the WMT12 metrics task, excluding metrics which did not have results for all language pairs
p68
aVAddressing discourse-level phenomena in machine translation is relatively new as a research direction
p69
aVCompared to this baseline, DR improves for three of the six Asiya metrics, while DR- lex improves for four of them
p70
aVOn the contrary, DR and DR- lex significantly improve over NIST, Rouge , TER, and BLEU
p71
aVNote that, even though DR- lex has better individual performance than DR, it does not yield improvements when combined with most of the metrics in group IV
p72
aVIn our experiments, we combine DR and DR- lex to other metrics in two different ways using uniform linear interpolation (at system- and segment-level), and using a tuned linear interpolation for the segment-level
p73
aVTo complement the set of individual metrics that participated at the WMT12 metrics task, we also computed the scores of other commonly-used evaluation metrics
p74
aVThis is a uniform linear combination of 12 individual metrics
p75
aVThe combinations with DR and DR- lex that improve over the original metrics are shown in bold , and those that degrade are in italic
p76
aVSome recent work has looked at anaphora resolution [ 5 ] and discourse connectives [ 1 ] , to mention two examples
p77
aVHowever, when linearly combined with other metrics, DR- lex outperforms 14 of the 19 metrics in Table 3
p78
aVGoing beyond the sentence-level is important since sentences rarely stand on their own in a well-written text
p79
aVIn this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation evaluation metrics
p80
aVGroup IV includes the metric combinations calculated with Asiya and described in Section 4
p81
aVNote that this is true both for the individual metrics from groups II and III, as well as for the metric combinations in group IV
p82
aVOnce again, tuning yields sizable improvements over the simple combination for the Asiya metrics (third column in Table 5
p83
aVAll uniform linear combinations are calculated outside Asiya
p84
aVAsiya [] is a suite for MT evaluation that provides a large set of metrics that use different levels of linguistic information
p85
aVWe experimented with tuning the weights of the individual metrics in the metric combinations, using the learning method described in Section 4.2
p86
aVAlthough modern SMT systems have switched to a discriminative log-linear framework, which allows for additional sources as features, it is generally hard to incorporate dependencies beyond a small window of adjacent words, thus making it difficult to use linguistically-rich models
p87
aVCombinations in the last group involve several metrics that already use linguistic information at different levels and are hard to improve over; yet, adding DR does improve, which shows that it has some complementary information to offer
p88
aVFor the experiments reported in Section 5 .4, we used pairwise rankings to discriminatively learn the weights of the linear combinations of individual metrics
p89
aVMoreover, DR yields improvements when combined with 15 of the 19 metrics; worsening only four of the metrics
p90
aVAcross all metrics, DR- lex yields an average Tau improvement of +.026, i.e., from .165 to .190
p91
aVGroup III contains other important evaluation metrics, which were not considered in the WMT12 metrics task
p92
aVWe speculate that this might be caused by the fact that the lexical information in DR- lex is incorporated only in the form of unigram matching at the sentence-level, while the metrics in group IV are already complex combined metrics, which take into account stronger lexical models
p93
aVOn average, DR improves Tau from .165 to .201, which is +.036, while DR- lex improves to .222, or +.057
p94
aVCombination of five metrics based on lexical similarity
p95

aVOverall, DR improves the average Tau from .207 to .244, which is +.037, while DR- lex improves to .267 or +.061

p99
aVWe grouped them in the following four families and calculated the uniform linear combination of the metrics in each group
p100
aVWe experiment with TKs applied to two different representations of the discourse tree non-lexicalized (DR), and lexicalized (DR- lex
p101
aVWe only present the average results over all four language pairs
p102
aVFrom the original ULC, we only replaced TER and Meteor individual metrics by newer versions taking into account synonymy lookup and paraphrasing
p103
aVIn this study, we evaluate to what extent existing evaluation metrics can benefit from additional discourse information
p104
aVIn this work, instead of proposing a new metric, we focus on enriching current MT evaluation metrics with discourse information
p105
aVWhat is also interesting to note is that when tuning is used, DR helps achieve sizeable improvements, even if not as strong as for DR- lex
p106
aVIn subsection 5.4 , we present the results of tuning the linear combination in a discriminative way
p107
aVWe will call this combined metric Asiya- 0809 in our experiments
p108
aVWe used the publicly available scores for all metrics that participated in the WMT12 metrics task [] spede07pP , AMBER, Meteor , TerrorCat , SIMPBLEU, XEnErrCats , WordBlockEC , BlockErrCats , and posF
p109
aVNote that improving over the last two Asiya metrics is very hard they have very high scores of .296 and .295; for comparison, the best segment-level system at WMT12 ( spede07pP ) achieved a Tau of .254
p110
aVThis suggests that DR contains information that is complementary to that used by the other metrics
p111
aVTable 3 shows the results for WMT12 at the segment-level
p112
aVTERp-A and Meteor -pa in Asiya u'\u005cu2019' s terminology
p113
aVThis is a large improvement, taking into account that the combinations are just uniform linear combinations
p114
aVThe results are shown in Table 5
p115
aVWe aggregated the data for different language pairs, and produced a single set of tuning weights for all language pairs
p116
aVIn order to make the scores of the different metrics comparable, we performed a min u'\u005cu2013' max normalization, for each metric, and for each language pair combination
p117
aVThese much larger improvements highlight the importance of tuning the linear combination when working at the segment-level
p118
aVFirst, we used Asiya u'\u005cu2019' s ULC [] , which was the best performing metric at the system and the segment levels at the WMT08 and WMT09 metrics tasks
p119
aVWe used the freely available version of the Asiya toolkit 4 4 http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/asiya/ in order to extend the set of evaluation measures contrasted in this study beyond those from the WMT12 metrics task
p120
aVWe first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-available discourse parser [] ; then, we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks []
p121
aVTable 2 shows the system-level experimental results for WMT12
p122
aVBLEU [] , NIST [] , TER [] , Rouge -W [] , and three Meteor variants []
p123
aVNIST and Rouge for both system- and segment-level, and BLEU and TER at segment-level
p124
aVThe evaluation metrics we used are described below
p125
aVWe measured the correlation of the metrics with the human judgments provided by the organizers
p126
aVIn order to rule out the possibility that the improvement of the tuned metrics on WMT12 comes from over-fitting, and to verify that the tuned metrics do generalize when applied to other sentences, we also tested on a new test set
p127
aVIn order to develop a discourse-aware evaluation metric, we first generate discourse trees for the reference and the system-translated sentences using a discourse parser, and then we measure the similarity between the two discourse trees
p128
aVFor BLEU and TER, they observed improved correlation with human judgments on the MTC4 dataset when linearly interpolating these metrics with their lexical cohesion score
p129
aVThese high scores allowed us to develop successful discourse similarity metrics
p130
aVFor evaluation, we follow the setup of the metrics task of WMT12 [] at the system-level, we use the official script from WMT12 to calculate the Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s correlation, where higher absolute values indicate better metrics performance; at the segment-level, we use Kendall u'\u005cu2019' s Tau for measuring correlation, where negative values are worse than positive ones
p131
aVBLEU, NIST, Meteor -ex, Rouge -W, and TERp-A
p132
aVWe believe that the semantic and pragmatic information captured in the form of DTs ( i )  can help develop discourse-aware SMT systems that produce coherent translations, and ( ii )  can yield better MT evaluation metrics
p133
aVFor reproducibility, below we explain the individual metrics with the exact names required by the toolkit to calculate them
p134
aVFor simplicity, in our tables we show results divided into evaluation groups
p135
aVOur experiments show that many existing metrics can benefit from additional knowledge about discourse structure
p136
aVWe can see that DR is already competitive by itself on average, it has a correlation of .807, very close to BLEU and TER scores (.810 and .812, respectively
p137
aVIn comparison to the syntactic and semantic extensions of MT metrics, there have been very few attempts to incorporate discourse information so far
p138
aVMeteor -ex (exact match), Meteor -st (+stemming) and Meteor -sy (+synonyms
p139
aV9 9 Tuning separately for each language pair yielded slightly lower results
p140
aVWe can see that DR performs badly, with a high negative Kendall u'\u005cu2019' s Tau of -.433
p141
aV3 3 http://www.statmt.org/wmt{11,12}/results.html This included the output from the systems that participated in the WMT12 and the WMT11 MT evaluation campaigns, both consisting of 3,003 sentences, for four different language pairs
p142
aVIn our experiments, we used the data available for the WMT12 and the WMT11 metrics shared tasks for translations into English
p143
aVThis should not be surprising a) the discourse tree structure alone does not contain enough information for a good evaluation at the segment-level, and (b) this metric is more sensitive to the quality of the DT, which can be wrong or void
p144
aVIn Rhetorical Structure Theory, discourse analysis involves two subtasks i ) discourse segmentation , or breaking the text into a sequence of EDUs, and ( ii ) discourse parsing , or the task of linking the units (EDUs and larger discourse units) into labeled discourse trees
p145
aVThe overall coverage, i.e., the number of unique sentences that were evaluated, was only a fraction of the total; the total number of judgments, along with other information of the datasets are shown in Table 1
p146
aVTherefore, we tuned the weights on all WMT12 pairwise judgments (no cross-validation), and we evaluated on WMT11
p147
aVOverall, we observe an average improvement of +.024, in the correlation with the human judgments
p148
aVFor a more up-to-date description, see the User Manual from Asiya u'\u005cu2019' s website
p149
aVHere we suggest some simple ways to create such metrics, and we also show that they yield better correlation with human judgments
p150
aVOn the contrary, DR- lex includes the lexical items to account for lexical matching; moreover, it separates the structure (the skeleton) of the tree from its labels, i.e., the nuclearity and the relations, in order to allow the tree kernel to give partial credit to subtrees that differ in labels but match in their skeletons
p151
aVWe argue that existing metrics that only use lexical and syntactic information cannot distinguish well between (b) and (c
p152
aVNote that each judgment effectively constitutes 10 pairwise system rankings
p153
aV5 5 A detailed description of every individual metric can be found at []
p154
aVDuring each cross-validation run, we trained our pairwise ranker using the human judgments corresponding to nine of the ten folds
p155
aVIn our experiments, we only consider translation into English, and use the data described in Table 1
p156
aVAdditionally, DR is more likely to produce a high number of ties, which is harshly penalized by WMT12 u'\u005cu2019' s definition of Kendall u'\u005cu2019' s Tau
p157
aVA number of metrics have been proposed to measure the similarity between two labeled trees, e.g.,, Tree Edit Distance [] and Tree Kernels []
p158
aVIn the semantic case, there are metrics that exploit the similarity over named entities and predicate-argument structures [ 3 ]
p159
aVWe then used the remaining fold for evaluation
p160
aVRecently, proposed discriminative models for both discourse segmentation and discourse parsing at the sentence level
p161
aVThere have been several attempts to incorporate syntactic and semantic linguistic knowledge into MT evaluation
p162
aVWong and Kit ( 2012 ) recently proposed an extension of MT metrics with a measure of document-level lexical cohesion []
p163
aVThe judgments represent rankings of the output of five systems chosen at random, for a particular sentence, also chosen at random
p164
aVCombination of four metrics ba-sed on syntactic information from constituency and dependency parse trees u'\u005cu2018' CP-STM-4 u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' DP-HWCM_c-4 u'\u005cu2019' , u'\u005cu2018' DP-HWCM_r-4 u'\u005cu2019' , and u'\u005cu2018' DP-Or(*) u'\u005cu2019'
p165
aVFor instance, at the syntactic level, we find metrics that measure the structural similarity between shallow syntactic sequences [ 3 ] or between constituency trees [ 7 ]
p166
aVThe discourse parser uses a dynamic Conditional Random Field [] as a parsing model in order to infer the probability of all possible discourse tree constituents
p167
aVThe area of discourse analysis for SMT is still nascent and, to the best of our knowledge, no previous research has attempted to use rhetorical structure for SMT or machine translation evaluation
p168
aVSee the discussion in Section 2
p169
aVFor example, the Rhetorical Structure Theory [] , or RST, represents text by labeled hierarchical structures called Discourse Trees (DTs), which can incorporate several layers of other linguistic information, e.g.,, syntax, predicate-argument structure, etc
p170
aVFurthermore, sentence-level scoring ( i )  is compatible with most translation systems, which work on a sentence-by-sentence basis, ( ii )  could be beneficial to modern MT tuning mechanisms such as PRO [] and MIRA [] , which also work at the sentence-level, and ( iii )  could be used for re-ranking n -best lists of translation hypotheses
p171
aVThese improvements are very close to those for the WMT12 cross-validation
p172
aVThe human-annotated data from the WMT campaigns encompasses series of rankings on the output of different MT systems for every source sentence
p173
aVCzech-English ( cs-en ), French-English ( fr-en ), German-English ( de-en ), and Spanish-English ( es-en ); as well as a dataset with the English references
p174
aVLater we tuned on WMT12 and evaluated on WMT11
p175
aVOne example are the semantics-aware metrics of Giménez and Màrquez ( 2009 ) and Comelles et al
p176
aVIn the present work, we use the convolution TK defined in [] , which efficiently calculates the number of common subtrees in two trees
p177
aVFirst, we did this using cross-validation to tune and test on WMT12
p178
aVOne way to cope with the limitations of the TK is to change the representation of the trees to a form that is suitable to capture the relevant information for our task
p179
aVUsing the standard set of 18 coarse-grained relations defined in [] , the parser achieved an F 1 -score of 79.8%, which is very close to the human agreement of 83%
p180
aVNote, however, that the variations are very small and might not be significant
p181
aVWhile in this work we focus on the latter, we think that the former is also within reach, and that SMT systems would benefit from preserving the coherence relations in the source language when generating target-language translations
p182
aVThe leaves of a DT correspond to contiguous atomic text spans, called Elementary Discourse Units or EDUs (three in Figure 4
p183
aVAdjacent spans are connected by certain coherence relations (e.g.,, Elaboration , Attribution ), forming larger discourse units, which in turn are also subject to this relation linking
p184
aVTree kernels (TKs) provide an effective way to integrate arbitrary tree structures in kernel-based machine learning algorithms like SVMs
p185
aVDiscourse analysis seeks to uncover this coherence structure underneath the text
p186
aVSeveral formal theories of discourse have been proposed to describe the coherence structure []
p187
aV7 7 We have fixed a bug in the scoring tool from WMT12, which was making all scores positive
p188
aVThis is demonstrated by the establishment of a recent workshop dedicated to Discourse in Machine Translation [] , collocated with the 2013 annual meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics
p189
aVUnlike their work, which measures lexical cohesion at the document-level, here we are concerned with coherence (rhetorical) structure , primarily at the sentence-level
p190
aVNote that this kernel was originally designed for syntactic parsing, where the subtrees are subject to the constraint that their nodes are taken with either all or none of the children
p191
aV2 2 The discourse parser is freely available from http://alt.qcri.org/tools/
p192
aVThe segmenter uses a maximum entropy model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, having an F 1 -score of 90.5 u'\u005cu2062' % , while human agreement is 98.3 u'\u005cu2062' %
p193
aVModeling discourse brings together the above research directions (a) and (b), which makes it an attractive goal for MT
p194
aVHowever, this situation is likely to change given the most recent advances in automatic discourse analysis []
p195
aVLexical cohesion is achieved using word repetitions and semantically similar words such as synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms
p196
aVHowever, some of the differences are very small
p197
aVOne possible reason could be the unavailability of accurate discourse parsers
p198
aVThis constraint of the TK imposes some limitations on the type of substructures that can be compared
p199
aVThe inferred (posterior) probabilities are then used in a probabilistic CKY-like bottom-up parsing algorithm to find the most likely DT
p200
aV1 1 We refer the reader to [ 6 ] for an in-depth overview of discourse-related research for MT
p201
aVHowever, so far the attempts to incorporate discourse-related knowledge in MT have been only moderately successful, at best
p202
aVIn Figure 7 we show the two representations for the subtree that spans the text u'\u005cu201c' suggest the ECB should be the lender of last resort u'\u005cu201d' , which is highlighted in Figure 4
p203
aVMore specifically, it uses the tags SPAN and EDU to build the skeleton of the tree, and considers the nuclearity and/or the relation labels as properties, added as children, of these tags
p204
