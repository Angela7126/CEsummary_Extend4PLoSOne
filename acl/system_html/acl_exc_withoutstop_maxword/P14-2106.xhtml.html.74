<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Broadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora []</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Broadly speaking, we can classify the attempts to add external knowledge to a parser in two sets using large semantic repositories such as WordNet and approaches that use information automatically acquired from corpora</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This aspect deserves further investigation, as the improvements seem to be related to both the type</a>
