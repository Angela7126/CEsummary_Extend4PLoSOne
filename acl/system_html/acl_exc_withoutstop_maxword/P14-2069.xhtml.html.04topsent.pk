VAs an easy observation, the emotion lexicon generated by the EaLDA model consistently and significantly outperforms the WordNet-Affect emotion lexicon and other three emotion classification systems
p1
aV1) we perform a case study for the lexicon generated by our algorithm, and (2) we compare the results of solving emotion classification task using our lexicon against different methods, and demonstrate the advantage of our lexicon over other lexicons and other emotion classification systems
p2
aVFor each emotion category and each text, we compare the number of words within this emotion category, and the average number of words within other emotion categories, to output a binary prediction of 1 or 0
p3
aVUsually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification
p4
aVWe descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output
p5
aVWe compare the performance between a popular emotion
p6
