VFollowing this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing states and words for each tag sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' as a latent tree graphical model, which encodes conditional independences among the words given the latent states
p1
aVAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p2
aVUnlike in phylogenetics and graphical models, where a single latent tree is constructed for all the data, in our case, each part of speech sequence is associated with its own parse tree
p3
aVIn particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics
