VClausal relations operate over longer distances in sentences, and so it is to be expected that showing longer stretches of context would perform better in these cases; that is indeed what the results showed
p1
aVAmong these relations, adverb modifiers stood out (Figure 5 ), because evidence suggested that words (63% success) made the relation more recognizable than phrases (47% success, p=0.056, W=574.0) u'\u005cu2013' but the difference was only almost significant, due to the smaller sample size (only 96 participants encountered this relation
p2
aVThis may be because the words are the most salient piece of information in an adverbial relation u'\u005cu2013' adverbs usually end in u'\u005cu2018' ly u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2013' and in the phrases condition the additional information distracts from recognition of this pattern
p3
aVAdditionally, one word was chosen as a focus word that was present in all the sentences, to make the relationship more recognizable ( u'\u005cu201c' life u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 4
p4
aVOne current presentation (not used with auto-suggest) is to name the relation and show blanks where the words that satisfy it would appear as in X is the subject of Y [ 14 ] ; we used this as the baseline presentation in our experiments because it employs the relation definitions found in the Stanford Dependency Parser u'\u005cu2019' s manual [ 4 ]
p5
aVParticipants were paid 50c (U.S.) for completing the study, with an additional 50c bonus if they correctly identified 10 or more of the 12 relationships
p6
aVA list of selectable options is shown under the search bar, filtered to be relevant as the searcher types
p7
aVIn other fields, grammatical queries can be used to develop patterns for recognizing entities in text, such as medical terms [ 6 , 13 ] , and products and organizations [ 3 ] , and for coding qualitative data such as survey results
p8
aVWe chose Amazon u'\u005cu2019' s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform as a source of study participants
p9
aVHowever, we know of no prior work on how to display grammatical relations so that they can be easily recognized

aVAhab, ___ the sentences each contained u'\u005cu2018' Ahab u'\u005cu2019' , highlighted in yellow, as the subject of different verbs highlighted in pink
p11
aVThe user can either click on the tree or modify the LISP expression to generalize the query
p12
aVFor instance, the Linguist u'\u005cu2019' s Search Engine [ 17 ] uses a query-by-example strategy in which a user types in an initial sentence in English, and the system produces a graphical view of a parse tree as output, which the user can alter
p13
aVAccording to Shneiderman and Plaisant [ 18 ] , query-by-example has largely fallen out of favor as a user interface design approach
p14
aVSearchers can recognize and select the option that matches their information need, without having to generate the query themselves
p15
aVA downside of QBE is that the user must manipulate an example to arrive at the desired generalization
p16
aVThe wide range of backgrounds provided by MTurk is desirable because our goal is to find a representation that is understandable to most people, not just linguistic experts or programmers
p17
aVIn another [ 5 ] , humanities scholars and social scientists are frequently skeptical of digital tools, because they are often difficult to use
