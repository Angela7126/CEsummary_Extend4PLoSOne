<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Compared with the performance of the official baseline (row 4 of Table 6), which is evaluated based on the output of BerkeleyParser [ 16 , 17 ] , our baseline tagger achieves comparable accuracies on both the source and target domain data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The averaged accuracies are calculated across the web domain data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results suggest that using mixed data can achieve almost as good performance as using the target sub-domain data, while using mixed data yields a much more robust tagger across all sub-domains</a>
