p2
aVThe external representations ( inlink_context ) are based on extracting the context around citation tokens to the document from other documents in the collection, excluding the set of test papers
p3
aVAt present, we are applying no cut-off and just rank all of the document u'\u005cu2019' s collection-internal references for each citation context, aiming to rank the correct one in the first positions in the list
p4
aVThis context is extracted in the same way as the query as a window, or list of w tokens surrounding the citation left and right
p5
aVThis representation can be based on any information found in the document collection, excluding the document d itself e.g., the text of the referenced document and the text of documents that cite it

aVWe tested three different approaches to generating a document u'\u005cu2019' s VSM representation internal representations , which are based on the contents of the document, external representations , which are built using
