<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Referring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is achieved with 1) three novel features derived from timelines to help measure the saliency of sentences, as well as 2) TimeMMR , a modification to the traditional Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [ 3 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal information, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this work we construct timelines (as a representation of temporal information) automatically and incorporate them into a state-of-the-art multi-document summarization system</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Formally, if a sentence s contains events u'\ud835' u'\udd3c' s = { e 1 , u'\u2026' , e n } , where each event is</a>
