<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Due to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The reason is that we suppose the optimal low-rank representation of the matrix Z conveys the truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation between the features and the corresponding labels</a>
