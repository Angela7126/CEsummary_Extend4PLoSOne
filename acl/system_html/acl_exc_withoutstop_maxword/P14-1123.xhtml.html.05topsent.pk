VGuided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion
p1
aVBased on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level

aVNot surprisingly, Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near non-existence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses
