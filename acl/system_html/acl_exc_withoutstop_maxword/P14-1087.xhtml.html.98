<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Recall that TimeMMR seeks to eliminate redundancy based on time span similarities and not lexical likeness</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The motivating idea is to reduce repeated information by preferring sentences which bring in new facts</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>TCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e., if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The constraint on the number of sentences that can be included in a summary requires us to select compact sentences which contain as many relevant facts as possible</a>
