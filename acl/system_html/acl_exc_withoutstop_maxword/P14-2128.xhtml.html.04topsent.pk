VTo show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology the open source MSTParser 1 1 We trained a second order labelled parser with all the configurations set to the default value

aVIn addition to the features designed for paired punctuations, such as bigram punctuation features listed in line 3 of Table 3, we also design features for non-paired punctuations

aVAs for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with
