VDoes semantic information in WordNet help dependency parsing found improvements in dependency parsing using MaltParser on gold POS tags
p1
aVTable 5 suggests that the improvements coming from WordNet u'\u005cu2019' s semantic file (SF) are unevenly distributed between the sentences that contain POS errors and those that do not (an increase of 0.28 for sentences without POS errors and 0.55 for those with errors
p2
aVOn the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors
