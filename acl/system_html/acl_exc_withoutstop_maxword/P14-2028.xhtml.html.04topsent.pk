VFirst of all, we evaluated the recall of hypotheses generator using K-best recall u'\u005cu2014' the number of correct spelling corrections for misspelled queries among K hypotheses divided by the total number of misspelled queries in the test set
p1
aVNext, three spelling correction methods were tested noisy channel, iterative correction and our method (stochastic iterative correction
p2
aVConsider we do not always transition deterministically to the next best correction, but instead transition randomly to a (potentially any ) correction with transition probability being equal to the posterior P ( c i c i - 1 ) , where c i - 1 is the correction we transition from, c i is the correction we transition to, and P ( u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu22c5' ) is defined by Equation 1
p3
aVThese techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior
