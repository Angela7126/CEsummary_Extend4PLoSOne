VWe treat citation polarity classification as a sentiment analysis domain adaptation task and therefore must be careful not to define features that are too domain specific
p1
aVWe are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset
p2
aVUsing a larger training set, along with mSDA, which makes use of the unlabeled data, leads to the best results for citation classification
p3
aVOn the other hand, because there is a limited amount of annotated citation data available, by leveraging large amounts of annotated polarity data we could potentially even improve citation classification
p4
aVOur approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features
p5
aVThe DFKI Citation Corpus 2 2 https://aclbib.opendfki.de/repos/trunk/citation_classification_dataset/ has been used for classifying citation
