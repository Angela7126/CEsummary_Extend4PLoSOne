<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The syntactic complexity of a test spoken response was estimated based on its similarity to the proficiency groups in the reference corpus with respect to the score-specific constructions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Taking an approach different from previous studies, we formulate the task of assigning a score of syntactic complexity to a spoken response as a classification problem given a spoken response, assign the response to a proficiency class</a>
