<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Estimating the mapping directly from raw categorical features ( u'\u03a9' 0 ) is both computationally expensive and likely inaccurate u'\u2013' using one-hot encoding the feature vectors in our experiments would have tens of thousands of components</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about the correspondence between source and target feature representations, such as dictionary entries, and thus have an edge over annotation projection in those cases where the amount of parallel data available</a>
