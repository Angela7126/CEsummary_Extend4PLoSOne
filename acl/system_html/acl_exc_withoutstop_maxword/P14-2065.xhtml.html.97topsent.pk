VWe next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p1
aVAs noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments
p2
aVThus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account
p3
aVThe Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predicates with the same syntactic properties were systematically related semantically
p4
aVEven a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames
p5
aVThe consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames
p6
aVIn Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2
p7
aVThe exact semantics associated with a verb may depend on its syntactic frame
p8
aVThere are many sophisticated rubrics for calculating consistency
p9
aVThus Sally rolled the ball entails that somebody applied force to the ball (namely
p10
aVThe consistency for this class/frame combination is 60%
p11
aVThus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet
