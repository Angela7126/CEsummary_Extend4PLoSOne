<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, we present the simple tree transform from a full treebank parse tree to a (root attached) sequence of hedges</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The hedge tree transform converts the original parse tree into a hedge parse tree</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Next, we discuss modifications to inference and the resulting computational complexity gains</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, we discuss segmenting to further reduce computational complexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In section 2.3 , we present our approach to hedge segmentation</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the resulting hedge parse tree, every child of the top-most node spans at most L words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this section, we present the details of our approach</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this section we present our segmentation model which takes the input sentence and chunks it into appropriate segments for hedge parsing</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Table 1 presents hedge parsing accuracy on the development set for the full parsing baseline, where the output of regular PCFG parsing is transformed to hedges and evaluated, versus parsing with a hedgebank grammar, with no segmentation of the strings</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To transform an original tree to a hedge tree, we remove every non-terminal with span larger than L and attach its children to its parent</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Other than the symbol at the root of the tree, the only constituents with span length greater than L in the binarized tree will be labeled with these special binarization non-terminals</a>
