<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Unfortunately, SimRank has time complexity u'\ud835' u'\udcaa' u'\u2062' ( n 3 ) (where n is the number of nodes in the graph) and therefore does not scale to the large graphs that are typical of NLP</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The extension of CoSimRank to similarity across graphs is important for the application of bilingual lexicon extraction given a set of correspondences between nodes in two graphs A and B (corresponding to two different languages), a pair of nodes ( a u'\u2208' A , b u'\u2208' B ) is a good</a>
