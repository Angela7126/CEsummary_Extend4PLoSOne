p1
aVIn addition, we invented the \u005cUnderline Excitation relation that is expressed by binary patterns made of excitatory and inhibitory templates (Section 3.1
p2
aVThose patterns were acquired from our web corpus by Kloetzer et al
p3
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method

aVBinary pattern of our semantic relations that co-occurs with two nouns of an event causality candidate in our web corpus
p7
aVWe only keep the event causality candidates each phrase of which consists of excitation templates , which have been shown to be effective for causality extraction [ 12 ] and other semantic NLP tasks [ 19 ]
p8
aVExcitation is a semantic property of templates that classifies them into excitatory , inhibitory , and neutral
p9
aVMoreover, for broader coverage, we acquired binary patterns that entail or are entailed by one of the patterns of the above six semantic relations
p10
aVFor the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u005cu27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u005cu27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1

aVshows our semantic relation features
p12
aVWe applied our event causality extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Section 3.1 ) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs from them (See Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-event-causality in the supplementary notes for examples
p13
aVWe simply add an additional argument position to each template in the 43,697 excitation templates to make binary patterns
p14
aVBase features represent the basic properties of event causality like nouns, templates, and their excitation polarities (See Section LABEL:A-sec:base-features in the supplementary notes
p15
aVWe acquired 335,837 patterns by this method
p16
aVWe applied the excitation filter to all 272,025,401 event causality candidates from the web and 132,528,706 remained
p17
aVTo increase the number of acceptable scenarios, our method identifies compatibility w.r.t causality between two phrases by a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation [ 12 ] , which properly relaxes the chaining condition (Section 3.1 describes it
p18
aV5 5 Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model [ 24 ]

aVSection 3.3 shows how to rank event causality candidates
p21
aVSection 3.1 describes how to extract event causality candidates, and Section 3.2 details our features
p22
aVDefinition-based features , as detailed in Section LABEL:A-sec:definition-based-association-features in the supplementary notes, resemble the Wikipedia-based features except that the information source is the definition sentences automatically acquired from our 600 million web pages using the method of Hashimoto et al
p23
aVHowever, as described in Section 1 , our event causality criteria are different; since they regarded phrase pairs that were not self-contained as event causality (their annotators checked the original sentences of phrase pairs to see if they were event causality), their judgments tended to be more lenient than ours, which explains the performance difference
p24
aVNext we compared our method with the baselines based on Hashimoto et al
p25
aVSee De Saeger et al
p26
aVAnnotators regarded as event causality only phrase pairs that were interpretable as event causality without contexts (i.e.,, self-contained
p27
aVAfter applying additional filters (see Section LABEL:A-sec:filtering-conditions in the supplementary notes) including those based on a stop-word list and a causal connective list to remove unlikely event causality candidates that are not removed by the above filter, we finally acquired 2,451,254 event causality candidates
p28
aVTo favor the baselines for fairness, the event causality candidates of the development and test data were restricted to those with excitation values
p29
aVWe then estimated that, with the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality candidates, among which the estimated number of positive examples is 377,794
p30
aVThe semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus based on Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008
p31
aVA common argument filter removes a scenario if a joint part consists of two templates that share no argument in our u'\u005cu27e8' argument, template u'\u005cu27e9' database, which is compiled from the syntactic dependency data between arguments and templates extracted from our web corpus
p32
aVFor context feature extraction, the event causality candidates are accompanied by the original sentences from which they were extracted

p43
aVHashimoto et al
p44
aVBelow we describe the semantic relations that we believe are likely to constitute event causality
p45
aVExcitation is divided into six sub types based on the excitation polarity of the binary patterns, the argument positions, and the existence of causative markers
p46
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates in Section 3.1
p47
aVOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p48
aVThe Excitation relation roughly means that A activates B (excitatory) or suppresses it (inhibitory
p49
aVThe baselines are not complete implementations of Do et al u'\u005cu2019' s method which uses discourse relations identified based on Lin et al
p50
aVThis is important since future scenarios, which are generated by chaining event causality as described below, must be self-contained, unlike Hashimoto et al
p51
aVthe performance degraded (46.27 u'\u005cu2192' 45.86) when we only used the Causation binary patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns compared to Proposed
p52
aV2012 ) used semantic relations to generalize acquired causality instances that include those that are not obviously related to causality
p53
aVWe hypothesize that two nouns with some particular semantic relations are more likely to constitute event causality
p54
aVThey developed an automatic excitation template acquisition method that assigns each template an excitation value in range [ - 1 , 1 ] that is positive if the template is excitatory and negative if it is inhibitory
p55
aVOur future scenario generation method creates scenarios by chaining event causalities
p56
aVFor B3 and B4 , 500 semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus using the method of Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008 )
p57
aVFor instance, we make binary patterns A rises B and A lowers B from excitatory template rise X and inhibitory template lower X respectively
p58
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates
p59
aVWe collected 257 patterns for this relation
p60
aVSemantic relation types (e.g Causation and Entailment ) of the binary pattern of SR1
p61
aVCausation is the causal relation between two entities and is expressed by binary patterns like A causes B
p62
aV2,178 patterns were collected for this relation
p63
aVRemember that excitatory templates like cause X entail that X u'\u005cu2019' s function or effect is activated, but inhibitory templates like lower X entail that it is suppressed (Section 3.1
p64
aVThey are class-dependent patterns , which have semantic class restrictions on arguments
p65
aV2011 ) and Kloetzer et al
p66
aVWe require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted
p67
aVNext we describe our experiments on event causality extraction and show (a) that most of our features are effective and (b) that our method outperforms the baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ]
p68
aVWe developed features that capture the characteristics of likely contexts for Japanese event causality (See Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features in the supplementary notes
p69
aVProposed is our method
p70
aVThe experiments in Section 5.1.1 show that not only Causation and Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) but the other relations are also effective for event causality extraction
p71
aVBesides features similar to those described above, we propose semantic relation features 3 3 Radinsky et al
p72
aVExcitatory templates such as cause X entail that the function, effect, purpose or role of their argument u'\u005cu2019' s referent is activated, enhanced, or manifested, while inhibitory templates such as lower X entail that it is deactivated or suppressed
p73
aVCEA-based features are based on the Cause Effect Association (CEA) measure of Do et al
p74
aVNote that means can be seen as u'\u005cu201c' causing u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' realizing u'\u005cu201d' the purpose of using the means in this relation, and actually event causality can be obtained by incorporating noun pairs of this relation into template pairs like activate A u'\u005cu2192' conduct B
p75
aVSuch semantic relations can be expressed by (otherwise unintuitive) patterns like A is an ingredient for B
p76
aVEven when adding the Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns, the performance was still slightly worse than Proposed
p77
aV2011 ) generated semantic knowledge like causality that is written in no sentence
p78
aVSuch noun pairs mean event causality by substituting them into template pairs like omit A u'\u005cu2192' get B
p79
aVFrom the training data, our method seemed to successfully learn what self-contained event causality is
p80
aVThey collectively constitute the \u005cUnderline Entailment relation
p81
aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
p82
aVOur underlying intuition is the observation that event causality tends to hold between two entities linked by semantic relations which roughly entail that one entity strongly affects the other
p83
aVIn this case, the two event causality pairs tend to be about different topics and constitute an incoherent scenario
p84
aVFirst, we assume that two nouns (e.g., slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification ) that take some specific binary semantic relations (e.g., A causes B ) tend to constitute event causality if combined with two predicates (e.g., conduct and exacerbate
p85
aVOur method achieved 70% precision at 13% recall; we can extract about 69,700 event causality pairs with 70% precision, as described below
p86
aVThen we check a noun pair (the nouns of the cause and effect phrases) for each event causality candidate, and give the candidate all the patterns in the database that co-occur with the noun pair
p87
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1
p88
aVProposed is our proposed method
p89
aVAccordingly, we generated a scenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus that was crawled in 2007, but the vibrio risk due to global warming has actually been observed in the Baltic sea and reported in Baker-Austin et al
p90
aVWe extracted 557 social problem nouns and used the cause phrases of the event causality candidates that consisted of one of the social problem nouns as the scenario u'\u005cu2019' s beginning event
p91
aVSome of the scenarios we generated are written on no page in our input web corpus
p92
aVTanaka et al
p93
aVThe number of patterns is 490
p94
aVAs such, semantic relations like the Material relation can also be useful
p95
aVWe implement what we consider likely contexts for event causality as context features
p96
aVExperiments using 600 million web pages [ 2 ] show that our method outperforms baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ] by more than 19% of average precision
p97
aVEach phrase in the event causality must consist of a predicate with an argument position ( template , hereafter) like conduct X and a noun like slash-and-burn agriculture that completes X
p98
aVWe also require the predicate of the cause phrase to syntactically depend on the effect phrase in the sentence from which the event causality was extracted; we guarantee this by verifying the dependencies of the original sentence
p99
aVNext we examined whether the semantic relations that do not seem directly relevant to causality like Material are effective
p100
aVConsequently we conclude that not only semantic relations directly relevant to causality like Causation but also those that seem to lack direct relevance to causality like Material are somewhat effective
p101
aVFor event causality extraction , clues used by previous methods can roughly be categorized as lexico-syntactic patterns [ 1 , 20 ] , words in context [ 19 ] , associations among words [ 28 , 22 , 8 ] , and predicate semantics [ 12 ]
p102
aVTable 9 shows the estimated number of acceptable scenarios generated with 70% precision
p103
aVMany phrase pairs described two events that often happen in parallel but are not event causality (e.g., reduce the intake of energy and increase the energy consumption ) in the highly ranked event causality candidates of Cs u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s and Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p
p104
aVThese datasets were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who annotated the event causality candidates without looking at the original sentences
p105
aVWe observed that CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p and CEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s performed poorly and tended to favor event causality candidates whose phrase pairs were highly relevant to each other but described the contrasts of events rather than event causality (e.g., build a slow muscle and build a fast muscle ) probably because their main components are PMI values
p106
aVTo make event causality self-contained, we wrote guidelines for manually annotating training/development/test data
p107
aVWe extract the event causality between two events represented by two phrases from single sentences that are dependency parsed
p108
aVWe obtained sentences from 600 million web pages
p109
aVPrevention is the relation expressed by patterns like A prevents B , which can be filled with toothbrushing and periodontal disease
p110
aVOur method exploits these features on top of our base features such as nouns and predicates
p111
aVSee Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-future-scenarios in the supplementary notes for examples of the generated scenarios
p112
aVNote that, for the diversity of the sampled scenarios, our sampling proceeded as follows i) Randomly sample a beginning event phrase from the generated scenarios ii) Randomly sample an effect phrase for the beginning event phrase from the scenarios iii) Regarding the effect phrase as a cause phrase, randomly sample an effect phrase for it, and repeat (iii) up to the specified number of steps (2 or 3
p113
aVOur evaluation is based on average precision ; 9 9 It is obtained by computing the precision for each point in the ranked list where we find a positive sample and averaging all the precision figures [ 18 ] we believe that it is important to rank the plausible event causality candidates higher
p114
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p115
aVTo this end, we propose a supervised method of extracting such event causality as conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification and use its output to generate future scenarios ( scenarios ), which are chains of causality that have been or might be observed in this world like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification u'\u005cu2192' increase Asian dust (from China) u'\u005cu2192' asthma gets worse
p116
aVNote that semantic relations are not restricted to those directly relevant to causality like A causes B but can be those that might seem irrelevant to causality like A is an ingredient for B (e.g., plutonium and atomic bomb as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p117
aVEach event causality candidate may be given multiple original sentences, since a phrase pair can appear in multiple sentences, in which case it is given more than one SVM score
p118
aVFor example, a likely context of event causality (underlined) would be
p119
aVWe restricted the argument positions (represented by Japanese postpositions) of the A slot to either ha (topic marker), ga (nominative), or de (instrumental) and those of the B slot to either ha , ga , de , wo (accusative), or ni (dative), and obtained 55,881 patterns

p121
aVTwo phrases are causally-compatible if they mention the same entity (typically described by a noun) that is predicated by the templates of the same excitation polarity
p122
aVNext we examined how many of the top 50,000 scenarios were acceptable and non-trivial , i.e.,, found in no page in our input web corpus, using the 341 acceptable samples
p123
aVFor example, global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) can be chained to constitute an acceptable scenario, but the joint part is not the same string
p124
aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s web information analysis system provides a what-happens-if QA service, which is based on our scenario generation method
p125
aVIts relation to event causality might seem unclear, but a material can be seen as a u'\u005cu201c' cause u'\u005cu201d' of a product
p126
aVIndeed materials can participate in event causality with the help of such template pairs as A is stolen u'\u005cu2192' B is made as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p127
aV× s 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the two phrases of event causality candidates, and s 1 and s 2 are the absolute excitation values of p 1 u'\u005cu2019' s and p 2 u'\u005cu2019' s templates
p128
aVA Causation pattern, B by A , constitutes an independent relation called the By relation
p129
aVThe estimated number is calculated as the product of the recall at 70% precision and the number of acceptable scenarios in all the generated scenarios, which is estimated by the annotated samples
p130
aVFor example, our method can identify the compatibility between sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise to chain global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus 2 2 A bacterium in the sea causing food-poisoning fouls (water

aV341 (68.20%) were acceptable, and the estimated number of acceptable scenarios at a precision rate of 70% and 80% are 26,700 and 5,200 (See Section LABEL:A-sec:precision-scenario-curve in the supplementary notes
p134
aVSome phrase pairs have the same noun pairs and the same template polarity pairs (e.g., omit toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' get a cavity and neglect toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' have a cavity , where omit X and neglect X are inhibitory and get X and have X are excitatory
p135
aVAs the beginning event of a scenario, we extracted nouns that describe social problems ( social problem nouns , e.g., deforestation ) from Wikipedia to focus our evaluation on the ability to generate scenarios about them, which is a realistic use-case of scenario generation
p136
aVThe performance was even worse when using no semantic relation ( u'\u005cu201c' None u'\u005cu201d' in Table 4
p137
aVSimilarly, Tsuchida et al
p138
aVTo show that our future scenario generation methods can generate many acceptable scenarios with reasonable precision, we experimentally compared four methods
p139
aVThe last assumption embodied in our association features is that each word of the cause phrase must have a strong association (i.e.,, PMI, for example) with that of the effect phrase as slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification in the above example, as in Do et al
p140
aVThey ranked event causality candidates by C u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1
p141
aVWeb-based features provide association measures between nouns using various window sizes in the 600 million web pages
p142
aVScenarios ( s u'\u005cu2062' c s) generated by chaining causally-compatible phrase pairs are scored by S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c ) , which embodies our assumption that an acceptable scenario consists of plausible event causality pairs
p143
aVTable 8 shows the number and precision of the samples
p144
aVIn preliminary experiments, since our proposed method u'\u005cu2019' s performance degraded when C u'\u005cu2062' s was incorporated, we did not use it in our method
p145
aVIt is written in no page in our input web corpus, which was crawled in 2007
p146
aVOur method optionally applies the following two filters to scenarios for better precision
p147
aVOther clues include shared arguments [ 28 , 4 , 5 ] , which we ignore since we target event causality about two distinct entities
p148
aVWe evaluated the features of our method by ablation tests
p149
aVUsing the above features, a classifier 6 6 We used SVM l u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' t with the polynominal kernel ( d = 2 ), available at http://svmlight.joachims.org classifies each event causality candidate into causality and non-causality

aVScenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) was generated by Proposed+Orig+Comm
p151
aVNeither involves chaining and restricts themselves to only one event causality step
p152
aVTo use them, we first make a database that records which noun pairs co-occur with each binary pattern
p153
aVIn a nutshell, they represent a connective ( C1 and C2 in Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features ), the distance between the elements of event causality candidate ( C3 and C4 ), words in context ( C5 to C8 ), the existence of adnominal modifier ( 9 to C10 ), and the existence of additional arguments of cause and effect predicates ( C13 to C20 ), among others
p154
aVOur second assumption is that there are grammatical contexts in which event causality is more likely to appear
p155
aVDo et al u'\u005cu2019' s S a u'\u005cu2062' a , which is PMI between arguments

aVIn Japanese, since the temporal order between events is usually determined by precedence in a sentence, we require the cause phrase to precede the effect phrase

aVUseful context information includes the mood of the sentences (e.g.,, the uncertainty mood expressed by uncertain above), which is represented by lexical features (Section 3.2.2
