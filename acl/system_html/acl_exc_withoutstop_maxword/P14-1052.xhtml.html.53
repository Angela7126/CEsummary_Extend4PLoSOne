<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The u'\u201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Notably, we must adjoin the word u'\u201c' which u'\u201d' to u'\u201c' the dog u'\u201d' during the portion of generation where the sentence reads u'\u201c' the dog chased the cat u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given sufficient depth for the search ( d = 3 was sufficient for our experiments, as our reward signal is fine-grained), STRUCT will produce two sentences joined by the conjunction u'\u201c' and u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This experiment is set up in the same way as the one above, with the exception of l u'\u201c' distracting u'\u201d' words, words which are not useful in the sentence to be generated l is defined as j - k</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Doing so might reduce the ability of STRUCT to produce a sentence which partially fulfills its goals</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The immediate value of a state, intuitively, describes closeness of an arbitrary partial sentence to our communicative goal</a>
