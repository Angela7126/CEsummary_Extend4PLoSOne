VAs any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word
p1
aVA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task
p2
aVWhile choosing arg u'\u005cu2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling
p3
aVWe tested all three methods on the u'\u005cu201d' common u'\u005cu201d' dataset as well to evaluate if our handling of hard cases affects the performance of our approach on the common cases of spelling error
p4
aVThese techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method
