<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>1 u'\u2264' k u'\u2264' m , l = n + 1 denotes the fraction of words in the sense cluster s i u'\u2062' k , that did not show up in any of the n clusters in t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u2018' birth cluster u'\u2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We did this evaluation for the candidate birth, join and split sense clusters obtained by comparing 1909-1953 time period with respect to 2002-2005</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We hypothesize that word w can undergo sense change from one time interval ( t u'\u2062' v i ) to another ( t u'\u2062' v j ) as per one of the following scenarios</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A sense cluster s i u'\u2062' z in t u'\u2062' v i splits into two (or more) sense clusters, s j u'\u2062' p 1 and s j u'\u2062' p 2 in t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Formally, we consider a sense change from t u'\u2062' v i to t u'\u2062' v j stable if it was also detected while comparing t u'\u2062' v i with the following time periods t u'\u2062' v k s</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Similarly, for a candidate sense change from t u'\u2062' v i to t u'\u2062' v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t u'\u2062' v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t u'\u2062' v i with any time interval t u'\u2062' v k , intermediate between t u'\u2062' v i and t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>An element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For the join case, we find WordNet synset ids s 1 and s 2</a>
