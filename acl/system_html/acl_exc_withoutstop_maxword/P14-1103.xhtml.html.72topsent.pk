VIn identifying constraints solely by their extensional violation profiles, this method does not directly identify the intensional definitions of the identified constraints, but to the extent that the resulting violation profiles are phonologically interpretable, we may conclude that the data themselves guide constraint identification
p1
aVWe consider this question by examining the dominant framework in modern phonology, Optimality Theory [, OT] , implemented in a log-linear framework, MaxEnt OT [] , with output forms u'\u005cu2019' probabilities based on a weighted sum of constraint violations
p2
aVWe propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions
