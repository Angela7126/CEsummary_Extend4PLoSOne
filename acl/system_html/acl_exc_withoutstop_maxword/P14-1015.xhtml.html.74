<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>All solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In short, each solution word is assumed to be generated from the language model or the translation model (conditioned on the problem words) with a probability of u'\u039b' and 1 - u'\u039b' respectively, thus accounting for the correlation assumption</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As outlined in Table 2 , each ( p , r ) pair would be assigned to one of the classes, solution or non-solution, based on whether it conforms better with the solution models (i.e.,, u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S</a>
