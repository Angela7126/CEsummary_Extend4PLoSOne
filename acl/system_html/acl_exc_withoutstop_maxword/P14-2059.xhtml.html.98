<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The external representations ( inlink_context ) are based on extracting the context around citation tokens to the document from other documents in the collection, excluding the set of test papers</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This representation can be based on any information found in the document collection, excluding the document d itself e.g., the text of the referenced document and the text of documents that cite it</a>
