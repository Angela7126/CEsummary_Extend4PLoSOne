<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They can be divided in three groups, according to their origin they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u201c' existential u'\u201d' view of semantic relatedness</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This can be considered as a baseline for extraction of relevant lexical pairs, to which we turn in the following section</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We do this by judging the relevance of a lexical relation in a context where both elements of a lexical pair occur</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As for improving distributional thesauri, outside of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial thesaurus is built [] , or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given</a>
