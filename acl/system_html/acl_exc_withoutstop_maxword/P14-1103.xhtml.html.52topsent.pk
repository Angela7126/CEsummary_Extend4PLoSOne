VWe consider this question by examining the dominant framework in modern phonology, Optimality Theory [, OT] , implemented in a log-linear framework, MaxEnt OT [] , with output forms u'\u005cu2019' probabilities based on a weighted sum of constraint violations
p1
aVWe propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions
p2
aVThe IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w

aVOur approach of casting the learning problem as one of identifying violation profiles is an attempt to determine the amount that can
