VIn addition to labelled data, a large amount of unlabelled data on the web domain is also provided
p1
aVWe trained 3 WRRBMs using the email domain data (RBM-E), weblog domain data (RBM-W) and mixed domain data (RBM-M), respectively, with each data set consisting of 300k sentences
p2
aVThe problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data
p3
aVCollobert et al
p4
aVIn addition, Collobert et al
p5
aVWe conduct experiments to test whether using the target domain data to train the WRRBM yields better performance compared with using mixed data from all sub-domains
p6
aVWe can see that using the target domain data achieves similar improvements compared with using the mixed data
p7
aVThis is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step
p8
aVTagging performance and lexicon coverages of each data set on the development sets are shown in Table 5
p9
aVThe data set consists of labelled data for both the source (Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank) and target (web) domains
p10
aVCompared with the performance of the official baseline (row 4 of Table 6), which is evaluated based on the output of BerkeleyParser [ 16 , 17 ] , our baseline tagger achieves comparable accuracies on both the source and target domain data

aVYang et al

aVWhile the tagger of Ma et al
p20
aVThe results suggest that using mixed data can achieve almost as good performance as using the target sub-domain data, while using mixed data yields a much more robust tagger across all sub-domains
p21
aVHowever, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data

p25
aVExploiting useful information from the web data can be the key to improving web domain tagging
p26
aVWe utilize the Word Representation RBM (WRRBM) factorization proposed by Dahl et al
p27
aV2012 ) and Turian et al
p28
aVWith data preprocessing, the average accuracy boosts to about 92.02 on the test set of the target domain
p29
aVWe reimplemented the greedy easy-first POS tagger of Ma et al
p30
aVWhile those approaches mainly explore token-level representations (word or character embeddings), using WRRBM is able to utilize both word and n-gram representations
p31
aVIn addition, following Dahl et al
p32
aVIn the fine-tuning phase, the parameters of the network are optimized on a set of labelled training data using guided learning
p33
aVWe use this baseline to examine the performance of a tagger trained purely on the source domain
p34
aVStatistics about labelled and unlabelled data are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively
p35
aVIn addition, while Titov ( 2011 ) and Glorot et al
p36
aVThe web domain data can be further classified into five sub-domains, including emails, weblogs, business reviews, news groups and Yahoo!Answers
p37
aVThe idea is to project the original feature representations into low dimensional representations, which yields a high-accuracy classifier on the target domain
p38
aV2013 ) induce bi-lingual word embeddings for word alignment
p39
aVIn addition, different from Le Roux et al
p40
aVIn some circumstances, we may know beforehand that the target domain data belongs to a certain sub-domain, such as the email domain
p41
aVThe training algorithm repeats for several iterations over the training data, which is a set of sentences labelled with gold standard POS tags
p42
aVTitov ( 2011 ) and Glorot et al
p43
aVFrom Figure 2 we can see that when knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM is incorporated, both the training strategies ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' word-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' ) improve accuracies on the source domain, which is consistent with previous findings (Turian et al., 2010; Collobert et al., 2011
p44
aVWe conduct experiments on the official data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task [ 18 ]
p45
aVRegarding using neural networks for sequential labelling, our approach shares similarity with that of Collobert et al
p46
aVThe new representations are induced based on the auxiliary tasks defined on unlabelled data together with a dimensionality reduction technique
p47
aVAccuracies of the baseline tagger are shown in the upper part of Table 6
p48
aVFeature templates are shown in Table 3, which are based on those of Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Shen et al
p49
aV2012), who found that using both the word embeddings and the hidden units of a tri-gram WRRBM as additional features for a CRF chunker yields larger improvements than using word embeddings only
p50
aVWe can choose to use only the word representations of the learned WRRBM
p51
aVWe integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger
p52
aVIntuitively, unsupervised pre-training moves the parameters of the WRRBM towards the region where properties of the web domain data are properly modelled
p53
aVSimilar result was reported by Dahl et al
p54
aVOur experiments are conducted on the data set provided by the SANCL 2012 shared task, which aims at building a single robust syntactic analysis system across the web-domain
p55
aVParticipants are not allowed to use web-domain labelled data for training
p56
aVThe idea of learning representations from unlabelled data and then fine-tuning a model with such representations according to some supervised criterion has been studied before [ 26 , 6 , 8 ]
p57
aVIn such cases, it might be desirable to train WRRBM using data only on that domain
p58
aVTowards this end, we adopt the idea of learning representations which has been demonstrated useful in capturing hidden regularities underlying the raw input data (web text, in our case
p59
aVThe data sets are generated by first concatenating all the cleaned unlabelled data, then selecting sentences evenly across the concatenated file
p60
aVThe best result achieved by using a 4-gram WRRBM, ( w i - 2 , u'\u005cu2026' , w i + 1 ) , with 300 hidden units learned on 1,000k web domain sentences are shown in row 3 of Table 6
p61
aVThe raw web domain data contains much noise, including spelling error, emotions and inconsistent capitalization
p62
aVThe main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u005cu2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )
p63
aVUnsupervised learning is often used for training encoders that convert the input data to abstract representations (i.e., encoding vectors
p64
aV2006 ) propose to induce shared representations for domain adaptation, which is based on the alternating structure optimization (ASO) method of Ando and Zhang ( 2005
p65
aVHowever, state-of-the-art POS taggers in the literature [ 5 , 23 ] are mainly optimized on the the Penn Treebank (PTB), and when shifted to web data, tagging accuracies drop significantly [ 18 ]
p66
aVWe apply the same preprocessing steps to all the unlabelled data
p67
aVFor POS tagging, we found that a simple linear layer yields satisfactory accuracies
p68
aVThis result illustrates that the ngram-level knowledge captures more complex interactions of the web text, which cannot be recovered by using only word embeddings
p69
aVWe trained the WRRBM on web-domain data of different sizes (number of sentences
p70
aVOn the web-domain data, shown in Figure 3 and 4, we found that leaving the learned representation unchanged ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' ) yields consistently higher performance gains
p71
aVThe neural network of our baseline tagger only contains the sparse-feature module
p72
aVMoreover, we achieve the highest tagging accuracy reported so far on this data set, surpassing those achieved using parser combinations based on self-training [ 24 , 12 ]
p73
aVThe neural network proposed in Section 3 is used for POS disambiguation by the easy-first POS tagger
p74
aVInspired by this observation, we apply the RBM to learn feature representations from word n-grams
p75
aVFinally, more detailed accuracies under the 4 settings on the email domain are shown in Table 4
p76
aVHowever, for the email domain, RBM-W yields much smaller improvement compared with RBM-E, and vice versa
p77
aVIn particular, we both use a non-linear layer to model complex relations underling word embeddings
p78
aVSuch distribution can be easily obtained by adding a soft-max layer on top of the output layer to perform a local normalization, as done by Collobert et al
p79
aVSecond, the web-feature module also allows us to make a comparison between whether or not to further adjust the pre-trained representation in the supervised fine-tuning phase, which corresponds to the supervised learning strategies of Turian et al
p80
aVPerformance of the top 2 systems of the SANCL 2012 task are also shown in Table 6
p81
aVWe integrate the learned WRRBM into a neural network, which serves as a scorer for POS disambiguation
p82
aVThe parameters { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1b' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1c' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( 1 ) , u'\u005cu2026' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( n ) } can be trained using a Metropolis-Hastings-based CD variant and the learned word representations also capture certain syntactic information; see Dahl et al
p83
aVAs mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM
p84
aVThe input for the this module is the word n-gram ( w i - l , u'\u005cu2026' , w i + r ) , the form of which is identical to the training data of the pre-trained WRRBM
p85
aVExperimental results under the 4 combined settings on the development sets are illustrated in Figure 2, 3 and 4, where the x-axis denotes the size of the training data and y-axis denotes tagging accuracy
p86
aVUnder the output layer, the network consists of two modules the web-feature module , which incorporates knowledge from the pre-trained WRRBM, and the sparse-feature module , which makes use of other POS tagging features
p87
aVOur results suggest that while both strategies improve in-domain tagging accuracies, keeping the learned representation unchanged consistently results in better cross-domain accuracies
p88
aVWhile most previous work focus on in-domain sequential labelling or cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to learn representations for web-domain structured prediction
p89
aVThis may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input [ 27 ]
p90
aVOur method achieves a 93.27 u'\u005cu2062' % average accuracy across the web-domain, which is the best result reported so far on this data set, higher than those given by ensembled syntactic parsers
p91
aV2011 ) train their network by maximizing the training set likelihood, while our approach is to minimize the margin loss using guided learning
p92
aVIn particular, their regularizer aims to minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between the marginal distributions of the learned representations on the source and target domains
p93
aVLearning representations has been intensively studied in computer vision tasks [ 2 , 13 ]
p94
aVWe choose the easy-first tagging approach since it has been demonstrated to give higher accuracies than the standard left-to-right POS tagger [ 23 , 15 ]
p95
aV2013) utilizes a linear scorer, our tagger adopts the neural network as its scorer
p96
aVSuch representations capture hidden properties of the input, and can be used as features for supervised tasks [ 3 , 20 ]
p97
aVThis can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' of the learned WRRBM
p98
aVRather than tagging a sentence from left to right, easy-first tagging is based on a deterministic process, repeatedly selecting the easiest word to tag
p99
aVSuch high dimensional input gives rise to high computational cost and it is not clear whether those approaches can be applied to large scale unlabelled data, with hundreds of millions of training examples
p100
aVOur greedy tagger achieves 93.27 u'\u005cu2062' % tagging accuracy, which is significantly better than the baseline u'\u005cu2019' s 92.02 u'\u005cu2062' % accuracy ( p 0.05 by McNemar u'\u005cu2019' s test
p101
aVSuch auxiliary tasks can be specific to the supervised task
p102
aVThe basic idea is to share word representations across different positions in the input n-gram while using position-dependent weights to distinguish between different word orders
p103
aVWhile emails and weblogs are used as the development sets, reviews, news groups and Yahoo!Answers are used as the final test sets
p104
aVPrevious work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning [ 6 ] or as fixed features that are kept unchanged [ 26 , 8 ]
p105
aVAnalysing and extracting useful information from the web has become an increasingly important research direction for the NLP community, where many tasks require part-of-speech (POS) tagging as a fundamental preprocessing step
p106
aVIn addition, adjusting the learned representation or keeping them fixed does not result in too much difference in tagging accuracies
p107
aVWe can see that the improvement of using word representations mainly comes from better accuracy of out-of-vocabulary (oov) words
p108
aVIn this section, we give some background on RBMs and then show how they can be used to learn representations of the web text
p109
aVThe tagging performance is evaluated according to the official evaluation metrics of SANCL 2012
p110
aVWhile previous work [ 23 , 29 , 9 ] apply guided learning to train a linear classifier by using variants of the perceptron algorithm, we are the first to combine guided learning with a neural network, by using a margin loss and a modified back-propagation algorithm
p111
aVIn the pre-training phase, we learn an encoder that converts the web text into an intermediate representation, which acts as useful features for prediction tasks
p112
aVThe web-feature module, shown in the lower left part of Figure 1, consists of a input layer and two hidden layers
p113
aV2010 ) , we also lowercased all the unlabelled data and removed those sentences that contain less than 90% a-z letters
p114
aVMost of the indicative features for POS disambiguation can be found from the words and word combinations within a local context [ 21 , 5 ]
p115
aVTo our knowledge, we are the first to investigate guided learning for neural networks
p116
aVThe second layer is a sigmoid layer to model non-linear relations between the word projections
p117
aVTheir work differs from ours in that their approaches learn representations from the feature vectors for sentiment classification, which might be of thousands of dimensions
p118
aVOur method learns representations from only word n-grams with n ranging from 3 to 5, which can be easily applied to large scale-data
p119
aVOur approach is to leverage the two sources of information in one neural network by combining them though a shared output layer, as shown in Figure 1
p120
aVParameters of the network are trained using guided learning, where learning and search interact with each other
p121
aVFor each data set, we investigate an extensive set of combinations of hyper-parameters the n-gram window ( l , r ) in { ( 1 , 1 ) , ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 2 ) , ( 2 , 2 ) } ; the hidden layer size in { 200 , 300 , 400 } ; the learning rate in { 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 }
p122
aVThe sparse-feature module, as shown in the lower right part of Figure 1, is designed to incorporate commonly-used tagging features
p123
aVAs pointed out by Plank ( 2009 ) , for many NLP tasks, defining the auxiliary tasks is a non-trivial engineering problem
p124
aVBy adopting greedy layer-wise training [ 10 , 2 ] , DBNs are capable of modelling higher order non-linear relations between the input, and has been demonstrated to improve performance for many computer vision tasks [ 10 , 2 , 13 ]
p125
aVPseudo-code of easy-first tagging is shown in Algorithm 1
p126
aVFollowing some participants [ 12 ] , we conduct simple preprocessing steps to the input of the development and the test sets 2 2 The preprocessing steps make use of no POS knowledge, and does not bring any unfair advantages to the participants
p127
aV2012 ) , we do not use any external resources in data cleaning
p128
aVIn each iteration, the procedure shown in Algorithm 2 is applied to each sentence in the training set
p129
aVThis can be achieved by also initializing the parameters of the second layer of the web-feature module using the position-dependent weight matrix and hidden bias of the learned WRRBM
p130
aV2011 ) use the learned representation to improve cross-domain classification tasks, we are the first to apply it to cross-domain structured prediction
p131
aVThe web-feature module enables us to explore the learned WRRBM in various ways
p132
aVFrom Figures 2, 3 and 4, we can see that adopting the ngram-level representation consistently achieves better performance compared with using word representations only ( u'\u005cu201c' word-fixed u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-fixed u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' word-adjusted u'\u005cu201d' vs u'\u005cu201c' ngram-adjusted u'\u005cu201d'
p133
aVAlternatively, we can choose to use the hidden states of the WRRBM, which can be treated as the representations of the input n-gram
p134
aVBy contrast, using n-gram representations improves the performance on both oov and non-oov
p135
aVIn each case, there can be two different training strategies depending on whether the learned representations are further adjusted or kept unchanged during the fine-turning phrase
p136
aVAll these parameters are selected according to the averaged accuracy on the development set
p137
aVThe first layer is a linear projection layer, where each word in the input is projected into a D -dimensional real value vector using the projection operation described in Section 2.2
p138
aVThe tagging accuracy is defined as the percentage of words (punctuations included) that are correctly tagged
p139
aV2006 ) , the advantage of using RBMs is that it learns representations in a pure unsupervised manner, which is much simpler
p140
aVThe web-feature and sparse-feature modules are combined by a linear output layer, as shown in the upper part of Figure 1
p141
aVThe algorithm proposed here belongs to a general framework named guided learning , where search and learning interact with each other
p142
aVFrom the lexicon coverages, we can see that the sub-domains varies significantly
p143
aVOur model captures such a dependency in a discriminative manner, by just adding tag-related features to the sparse-feature module
p144
aVDepending on the specific task being considered, the output of this layer can be further fed to other non-linear layers, such as a sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent layer, to model more complex relations
p145
aVFirst, it allows us to investigate knowledge from the WRRBM incrementally
p146
aVIf the loss is zero, the algorithm continues to process the next untagged word
p147
aVIn NLP, there is also much work along this line
p148
aVAt each step, the algorithm adopts a scorer, the neural network in our case, to assign a score to each possible word-tag pair ( w , t ) , and then selects the highest score one ( w ^ , t ^ ) to tag (i.e.,, tag w ^ with t ^
p149
aVIn this work, we investigate both strategies and give empirical comparisons in the cross-domain setting
p150
aVNote that one can stack standard RBMs on top of a WRRBM to construct a Deep Belief Network (DBN
p151
aVThe value of each unit in this layer denotes the score of the corresponding POS tag
p152
aVAt each step during the processing of a training example, the algorithm calculates a margin loss based on two word-tag pairs ( w ¯ , t ¯ ) and ( w ^ , t ^ ) (line 4 u'\u005cu223c' line 6 w ¯ , t ¯ ) denotes the word-tag pair that has the highest model score among those that are inconsistent with the gold standard, while ( w ^ , t ^ ) denotes the one that has the highest model score among those that are consistent with the gold standard
p153
aVWhile in our case, each visible variable corresponds to a word, which may take on tens-of-thousands of different values
p154
aVThe learned model preserves the property of preferring to tag easy words first
p155
aVTherefore, a better idea is to keep the representation unchanged so that we can learn a function that maps the general web-text properties to its syntactic categories
p156
aV2011 ) model the dependency between neighbouring tags in a generative manner, by employing a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j
p157
aVFor each position j , there is a weight matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( j ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H × D , which is used to model the interaction between the hidden layer and the word projection in position j
p158
aVThe first layer of this module is a linear transformation layer, which converts the high dimensional sparse vector into a fixed-dimensional real value vector
p159
aVHere u'\u005cu201c' easiness u'\u005cu201d' is evaluated based on a statistical model
p160
aVTraining the score involves a forward process of complexity O u'\u005cu2062' ( n u'\u005cu2062' T 2 ) , where T denotes the number of tags
p161
aVThis is because the standard loss is calculated based on a unique input vector
p162
aVIn some circumstances, probability distribution over POS tags might be a more preferable form of output
p163
aVMore specifically, given the i t u'\u005cu2062' h word w i of a sentence, we apply RBMs to model the joint distribution of the n-gram ( w i - l , u'\u005cu22ef' , w i + r ) , where l and r denote the left and right window, respectively
p164
aVTitov ( 2011 ) also propose a regularizer to constrain the inter-domain variability
p165
aVThe RBM is a type of graphical model that contains two layers of binary stochastic units u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' u'\u005cu2208' { 0 , 1 } V and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc21' u'\u005cu2208' { 0 , 1 } H , corresponding to a set of visible and hidden variables, respectively
p166
aVThis condition does not hold in our case, because w ^ and w ¯ may refer to different words, which means that the margin loss in line 6 of Algorithm 2 is calculated based on two different input vectors, denoted by u'\u005cu27e8' w ^ u'\u005cu27e9' and u'\u005cu27e8' w ¯ u'\u005cu27e9' , respectively
p167
aVThis yields the conditional distribution
p168
aVHere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc0c' w 1 denotes the parameters of the first layer of the web-feature module, which is a D ×
p169
aVAmong the many proposed encoders, we choose the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been successfully used in many tasks [ 14 , 10 ]
p170
aVwhich yields the conditional distributions
p171
aVNote that the visible units of RBMs are binary
p172
aVHowever, in this work we do not observe further improvement by employing DBNs
p173
aVConsecutive occurrences of one or more digits within a word are replaced with u'\u005cu201c' #DIG u'\u005cu201d'
p174
aVIn this way, two separate back-propagation updates can be used to update the model u'\u005cu2019' s parameters (line 8 u'\u005cu223c' line 11
p175
aVThe affine form of E with respect to u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc21' implies that the visible variables are conditionally independent with each other given the hidden layer units, and vice versa
p176
aVHowever, our network differs from theirs in the following aspects
p177
aV[t] Training over one sentence {algorithmic} [1] \u005cREQUIRE ( x , t ) a tagged sentence, neural net n u'\u005cu2062' n \u005cENSURE updated neural net n u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2032'
p178
aVOur approach consists of two phrases
p179
aVThe input for this module is a vector of boolean values u'\u005cu03a6' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f k u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) ) , where x denotes the partially tagged input sentence and f i u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) denotes a feature function, which returns 1 if the corresponding feature fires and 0 otherwise
p180
aVThe algorithm learns not only a local classifier, but also the inference order
p181
aVParameters of RBMs u'\u005cu0398' = { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1b' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1c' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' } can be trained efficiently using contrastive divergence learning (CD), see [ 11 ] for detailed descriptions of CD
p182
aVThen u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' ( j ) = u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' k means that the j -th word in the n-gram is w k
p183
aVFor the special case where w ^ and w ¯ do refer to the same word w , it can be easily verified that the two separate back-propagation updates equal to the standard back-propagation with a loss 1 + n u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( w , t ¯ ) - n u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' ( w , t ^ ) on the input u'\u005cu27e8' w u'\u005cu27e9'
p184
aVThe algorithm repeats until all words are tagged
p185
aVWe solve this problem by decomposing the margin loss in line 6 into two parts
p186
aVLet u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2f' ( j ) represents the j -th visible variable of the WRRBM, which is a vector of length
