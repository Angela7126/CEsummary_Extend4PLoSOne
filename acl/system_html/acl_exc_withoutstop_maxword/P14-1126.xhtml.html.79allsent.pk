VIn this work, we propose a learning framework for transferring dependency grammars from a resource-rich language to resource-poor languages via parallel text
p1
aVThe focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available
p2
aVWe train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data
p3
aVIn addition to their original results, we also report results by re-implementing the direct transfer parser based on the first-order projective dependency parsing model [ 30 ] (DTP u'\u005cu2020'
p4
aVFirst, by transferring the weight function to the corresponding weight in the well-developed English parsing model, we can project syntactic information across language boundaries
p5
aVAnother advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach
p6
aVTable 6 gives the results comparing the model without unlabeled data (-U) presented in this work to those five baseline systems and the oracle (OR
p7
aVThe monolingual treebanks in our experiments are from the Google Universal Dependency Treebanks [ 31 ] , for the reason that the treebanks of different languages in Google Universal Dependency Treebanks have consistent syntactic representations
p8
aVThe set of POS tags needs to be consistent across languages and treebanks
p9
aVAs presented in Section 3.1 , we evaluate our parsing approach on both version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Univereal Treebanks for seven languages 6 6 Japanese and Indonesia are excluded as no practicable parallel data are available
p10
aVA common strategy to make this parsing model efficiently computable is to factor dependency trees into sets of edges
p11
aVTable 7 shows the results of our system and the results of baseline systems u'\u005cu201c' USR u'\u005cu2020' u'\u005cu201d' is the weakly supervised system of Naseem et al
p12
aVFor the results on Google Universal Treebanks version 1.0, the improvement on average over the projected transfer paper (PTP u'\u005cu2020' ) is 3.96% and up to 6.22% for Korean and 4.80% for German
p13
aVBy adding entropy regularization from unlabeled data, our full model achieves average improvement of 0.29% over the u'\u005cu201c' -U u'\u005cu201d' setting
p14
aVPrepare parallel text by running word alignment method to obtain word alignments, 3 3 The word alignment methods do not require additional resources besides parallel text and prepare the unlabeled data
p15
aVOne may regard this system as an oracle of transfer parsing
p16
aVAccording to equation ( 9 ), p ~ ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) can also be factored into the multiplication of the weight of each edge, so both K P and its gradient can be calculated by running the O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) inside-outside algorithm [ 2 , 41 ] for projective parsing
p17
aVOur approaches significantly outperform all the baseline systems across all the seven target languages
p18
aVFor the purpose of evaluation of our approach and comparison with previous work, we need to exploit the gold POS tags to train the POS taggers
p19
aVIt is based on the transition-based dependency parsing paradigm [ 40 ]
p20
aVPOS tags are not available for parallel data in the Europarl and Kaist corpus, so we need to provide the POS tags for these data
p21
aVThat is, dependency tree y is treated as a set of edges e and each feature function F j u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) is equal to the sum of all the features f j u'\u005cu2062' ( e , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' )
p22
aVIt should be noted that the u'\u005cu201c' NMG u'\u005cu201d' system utilizes more than one helper languages
p23
aVWe introduce a multiplier u'\u005cu0393' as a trade-off between the two contributions (parallel and unsupervised) of the objective function K , and the final objective function K u'\u005cu2032' has the following form
p24
aVParsing accuracy is measured with unlabeled attachment score (UAS the percentage of words with the correct head
p25
aVHowever, the manually annotated treebanks that these parsers rely on are highly expensive to create, in particular when we want to build treebanks for resource-poor languages
p26
aVWe extend this learning framework so that it can be used to transfer cross-lingual knowledge between different languages
p27
aVWe select target languages based on the availability of these resources
p28
aVSo totally we have ten target languages
p29
aVThroughout this paper, English is used as the source language and we evaluate our approach on ten target languages u'\u005cu2014' Danish (da), Dutch (nl), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Italian (it), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es) and Swedish (sv
p30
aVFor non-projective parsing, the analogy to the inside algorithm is the O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) matrix-tree algorithm based on Kirchhoff u'\u005cu2019' s Matrix-Tree Theorem, which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant [ 25 , 46 ]
p31
aVFor this reason we use the universal POS tag set of Petrov et al
p32
aVDue to the normalizing factor Z ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) , the transferring distribution is a valid one
p33
aVSimilar with the calculation of K P , K U can also be computed by running the inside-outside algorithm [ 2 , 41 ] for projective parsing
p34
aVwhere F j are feature functions, u'\u005cu039b' = ( u'\u005cu039b' 1 , u'\u005cu039b' 2 , u'\u005cu2026' ) are parameters of the model, and Z u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) is a normalization factor, which is commonly referred to as the partition function
p35
aVFor example, if we want to make our model capable of utilizing more contextual information, we can extend our transferring weight to higher-order parts
p36
aVAs part-of-speech tags are also a form of syntactic analysis, this assumption weakens the applicability of our approach
p37
aVObviously, bilingual treebanks are much more difficult to acquire than the resources required in our scenario, since the labeled training data and the parallel text in our case are completely separated
p38
aVIn this section, we will describe the details of our experiments and compare our results with previous methods
p39
aVSo it is not directly comparable to our work
p40
aV1 1 For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the resource-poor language as the u'\u005cu201c' target language u'\u005cu201d' , and resource-rich language as the u'\u005cu201c' source language u'\u005cu201d'
p41
aVIn addition, in this study we use English as the source resource-rich language, but our methodology can be applied to any resource-rich languages
p42
aVThe gradient of a determinant may be computed by matrix inversion, so evaluating the gradient again has the same O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) complexity as evaluating the function
p43
aVThe three languages are Danish, Dutch and Greek
p44
aVOur work is based on the learning framework used in Smith and Eisner [ 44 ] , which is originally designed for parser bootstrapping
p45
aVHowever, previous studies [ 34 , 31 ] have demonstrated that a homogeneous representation is critical for multilingual language technologies that require consistent cross-lingual analysis for downstream components, and the heterogenous representations used in CoNLL shared-tasks treebanks weaken any conclusion that can be drawn
p46
aVOur approach training on only parallel data without unlabeled data for the target language
p47
aVThis led to a vast amount of research on unsupervised grammar induction [ 9 , 22 , 47 , 12 , 48 , 4 , 29 , 49 ] , which appears to be a natural solution to this problem, as unsupervised methods require only unannotated text for training parsers
p48
aVOne may regard u'\u005cu0393' as a Lagrange multiplier that is used to constrain the parser u'\u005cu2019' s uncertainty H to be low, as presented in several studies on entropy regularization [ 5 , 17 , 20 ]
p49
aVFor example, Figure 1 shows a dependency tree for the sentence, Economic news had little effect on financial markets , with the sentence u'\u005cu2019' s root-symbol as its root
p50
aVBy reducing unaligned edges to their delexicalized forms, we can still use those delexicalized features, such as part-of-speech tags, for those unaligned edges, and can address problem that automatically generated word alignments include errors
p51
aVOur approach training on both parallel and unlabeled data
p52
aVHowever, in our scenario we have no labeled training data for target languages but we have some parallel and unlabeled data plus an English dependency parser
p53
aVWe report both the results of the direct transfer and projected transfer parsers directly cited from McDonald et al
p54
aVCentral to our approach is a maximizing likelihood learning framework, in which we use an English parser and parallel text to estimate the u'\u005cu201c' transferring distribution u'\u005cu201d' of the target language parsing model (See Section 2.2 for more details
p55
aVIn recent years, dependency parsing has gained universal interest due to its usefulness in a wide range of applications such as synonym generation [ 43 ] , relation extraction [ 37 ] and machine translation [ 21 , 51 ]
p56
aVThe direct transfer parser (DTP) proposed by McDonald et al
p57
aVTable 5 illustrates the UAS of our approach trained on different amounts of parallel data, together with the results of the projected transfer parser re-implemented by us (PTP u'\u005cu2020'
p58
aVOur experiments rely on two kinds of data sets i) Monolingual Treebanks with consistent annotation schema u'\u005cu2014' English treebank is used to train the English parsing model, and the Treebanks for target languages are used to evaluate the parsing performance of our approach ii) Large amounts of parallel text with English on one side
p59
aVThird, entropy regularization with unlabeled data makes modest improvement on parsing performance over the parsers without unlabeled data
p60
aVTrain a parsing model for the target language by minimizing the objective K u'\u005cu2032' function which is the combination of expected negative log-likelihood on parallel and unlabeled data
p61
aVTable 3 and Table 4 shows the parsing results of our approach, together with the results of the baseline systems and the oracle, on version 1.0 and version 2.0 of Google Universal Treebanks, respectively
p62
aVThe projected transfer parser (PTP) described in McDonald et al
p63
aVWe train our parsing model with different numbers of parallel sentences to analyze the influence of the amount of parallel data on the parsing performance of our approach
p64
aV[ 34 ] , who train a delexicalized parser on English labeled training data with no lexical features, then apply this parser to parse target languages directly
p65
aVOur approach achieves significant improvement over previous state-of-the-art unsupervised and projected parsing systems across all the ten languages, and considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised dependency parsing performance
p66
aVthe supervised first-order projective dependency parsing model [ 30 ] , trained on the original treebanks with maximum likelihood estimation (equation 6
p67
aVWe also include the results of the unsupervised dependency parsing model with non-parallel multilingual guidance (NMG) proposed by Cohen et al
p68
aVWe assume that there are absolutely no labeled training data for the target language, but we have access to parallel data with a resource-rich language and a sufficient amount of labeled training data to build an accurate parser for the resource-rich language
p69
aVWe directly cite the results reported in McDonald et al
p70
aVThe results of unsupervised DMV model [ 22 ] are from Table 1 of McDonald et al
p71
aVWe define the transferring distribution by defining the transferring weight utilizing the English parsing model p u'\u005cu039b' E ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) via parallel data with word alignments
p72
aVBoth the results of the two systems are cited from Table 4 of McDonald et al
p73
aV[ 11 ] proposed an approach for unsupervised dependency parsing with non-parallel multilingual guidance from one or more helper languages, in which parallel data is not used
p74
aVOne of the most common model training methods for supervised dependency parser is Maximum conditional likelihood estimation
p75
aVThe parallel data set for each language contains 20,000 sentences
p76
aVMcDonald et al
p77
aVFor the purpose of transferring cross-lingual information from the English parser via parallel text, we explore the model training method proposed by Smith and Eisner [ 44 ] , which presented a generalization of K function [ 1 ] , and related it to another semi-supervised learning technique, entropy regularization [ 20 , 28 ]
p78
aVWe run two versions of our approach for each of the parallel data sets, one with unlabeled data (+U) and the other without them (-U
p79
aVTo make a thorough empirical comparison with previous studies, we also evaluate our system without unlabeled data (-U) on treebanks from CoNLL shared task on dependency parsing [ 6 , 38 ]
p80
aVThe results of the projected transfer parser re-implemented by us is marked as u'\u005cu201c' PTP u'\u005cu2020' u'\u005cu201d'
p81
aVFrom Table 7 , we can see that among the eight target languages, our approach achieves best parsing performance on six languages u'\u005cu2014' Danish, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish
p82
aV[ 34 ] proposed two parser transfer approaches between two different languages u'\u005cu2014' one is directly transferred parser from delexicalized parsers, and the other parser is transferred using constraint driven learning algorithm where constraints are drawn from parallel corpora
p83
aVWe strip all the dependency annotations off the training portion of each treebank, and use that as the unlabeled data for that target language
p84
aVFor the comparison of parsing performance, we run experiments on the following systems
p85
aVTable 2 shows the number of tokens in the parallel data used in the experiments
p86
aVThis proves the effectiveness of the entropy regularization from unlabeled data
p87
aVThen the K in equation ( 7 ) can be divided into two cases, according to whether u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i belongs to parallel data set P or unlabeled data set U
p88
aVFortunately, some recently proposed POS taggers, such as the POS tagger of Das and Petrov [ 13 ] , rely only on labeled training data for English and the same kind of parallel text in our approach
p89
aVIn this section, we illustrate the data sets used in our experiments and the tools for data preparation
p90
aV[ 14 ] presented a parser projection approach via parallel text using the posterior regularization framework [ 16 ]
p91
aVFor a supervised dependency parser with a set of training data { ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' i ) } , the logarithm of the likelihood (a.k.a the log-likelihood) is given by
p92
aVSecond, when gradually increasing the amount of parallel data, the parsing performance continues improving
p93
aVThe parallel data for these three languages are also from the Europarl corpus version 7
p94
aVIf the edge e t is not aligned to any edges of the English sentence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i s , we reduce the edge e t to the delexicalized form and calculate the transferring weight in the English parsing model
p95
aVSecond, McDonald et al
p96
aVOne possible direction to improve our approach is to replace parallel text with Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) [ 26 ] , which is a semi-structured data type encoding more syntactic information than parallel data
p97
aVThe parallel data sets are the ones contains 20,000 sentences
p98
aVFirst, even the parsers trained with only 500 parallel sentences achieve considerably high parsing accuracies (average 70.10% for version 1.0 and 71.59% for version 2.0
p99
aVThis demonstrates that our approach does not rely on a large amount of parallel data
p100
aVWe evaluate our approach on three target languages from CoNLL shared task treebanks, which do not appear in Google Universal Treebanks
p101
aVMoreover, our approach considerably bridges the gap to fully supervised dependency parsers, whose average UAS is 84.67%
p102
aVSeveral supervised dependency parsing algorithms [ 39 , 30 , 32 , 33 , 8 , 24 , 27 , 52 ] have been proposed and achieved high parsing accuracies on several treebanks, due in large part to the availability of dependency treebanks in a number of languages [ 31 ]
p103
aVThe labeled training data for each POS tagger are extracted from the training portion of each Treebanks
p104
aVIn our approach, word alignments for the parallel text are required
p105
aV[ 34 ] demonstrates that parsers with only delexicalized features produce considerably high parsing performance
p106
aVSeveral features in our parsing model involve part-of-speech (POS) tags of the input sentences
p107
aVThe parallel data sets contain 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000 and 20000 parallel sentences, respectively
p108
aVHowever, most bilingual text parsing approaches require bilingual treebanks u'\u005cu2014' treebanks that have manually annotated tree structures on both sides of source and target languages [ 45 , 7 ] , or have tree structures on the source side and translated sentences in the target languages [ 18 , 10 ]
p109
aVDanish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish, and same experimental setup as McDonald et al
p110
aVFrom the definition of the transferring weight, we can see that, if an edge e t of the target language sentence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i t is aligned to an edge e s of the English sentence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i s , we transfer the weight of edge e t to the corresponding weight of edge e s in the English parsing model p u'\u005cu039b' E ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99'
p111
aVFor projective parsing, several algorithms [ 33 , 8 , 24 , 27 ] have been proposed to solve the model training problems (calculation of objective function and gradient) for different factorizations
p112
aVFor the results on treebanks version 2.0, we can get similar observation and draw the same conclusion
p113
aVAll the results are shown in Table 7
p114
aVOur approach outperforms all these baseline systems and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the eight languages
p115
aVIn this paper, we focus on projective parsing
p116
aVTo train our parsing model, we need to find out the parameters u'\u005cu039b' that minimize the objective function K u'\u005cu2032' in equation ( 11
p117
aVWe randomly extract parallel sentences from each corpora, and smaller data sets are subsets of larger ones
p118
aV[ 11 ] , and u'\u005cu201c' PR u'\u005cu201d' which is the posterior regularization approach presented in Gillenwater et al
p119
aVThe second item ( K U ) of the K u'\u005cu2032' function in equation ( 11 ) is the Shannon entropy of the posterior distribution over parsing trees, and can be written into the following form
p120
aVFor comparison with previous studies, nevertheless, we also run experiments on CoNLL treebanks (see Section 4.4 for more details
p121
aVOur learning framework can be extended to higher-order dependency parsing models
p122
aVCohen et al
p123
aVTo facilitate comparison, we use the same eight Indo-European languages as target languages
p124
aVK P and K U are the contributions of the parallel and unsupervised data, respectively
p125
aVIn this paper, we consider a practically motivated scenario, in which we want to build statistical parsers for resource-poor target languages, using existing resources from a resource-rich source language (like English
p126
aVIn order to compare with more previous methods, we also report parsing performance on sentences of length 10 or less after punctuation has been removed
p127
aVWe also have a trained English parsing model p u'\u005cu039b' E ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99'
p128
aVThis scenario appears similar to the setting in bilingual text parsing
p129
aVUnfortunately, the unsupervised grammar induction systems u'\u005cu2019' parsing accuracies often significantly fall behind those of supervised systems [ 34 ]
p130
aVIn that work, they demonstrate that even the directly transferred delexicalized parser produces significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised parsers
p131
aV[ 11 ] 8 8 For each language, we use the best result of the four systems in Table 3 of Cohen et al
p132
aVDependency trees represent syntactic relationships through labeled directed edges between heads and their dependents
p133
aVFrom the definition of transferring weight in equation ( 8 ), the transferring distribution can be defined in the following way
p134
aVTrain an English parsing model p u'\u005cu039b' E ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) , which is used to estimate the transferring distribution p ~ ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' )
p135
aVUndoubtedly, we are primarily interested in applying our approach to build statistical parsers for resource-poor target languages without any knowledge
p136
aVTable 1 presents the statistics of the two versions of Google Universal Treebanks
p137
aVFor the first item in equation ( 15 ), an O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) dynamic programming algorithm that is closely related to the forward-backward algorithm [ 28 ] for the entropy regularized CRF [ 20 ] can be used for projective parsing
p138
aVThe treebanks from CoNLL shared-tasks on dependency parsing [ 6 , 38 ] appear to be another reasonable choice
p139
aVThe parallel data come from the Europarl corpus version 7 [ 23 ] and Kaist Corpus 4 4 http://semanticweb.kaist.ac.kr/home/index.php/Corpus10
p140
aVwhere w E ( u'\u005cu22c5' , u'\u005cu22c5' ) is the weight function of the English parsing model p u'\u005cu039b' E ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) , and e d u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' x t is the delexicalized form 2 2 The delexicalized form of an edge is an edge for which only delexicalized features are considered of the edge e t
p141
aVBut our goal is to develop a parser that can be used in completely monolingual setting for each target language of interest
p142
aVIn our scenario, we have a set of aligned parallel data P = { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i s , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i t , a i } where a i is the word alignment for the pair of source-target sentences ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i s , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i t ) , and a set of unlabeled sentences of the target language U = { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i t }
p143
aVWhat is more important is that most studies on bilingual text parsing assumed that the parser is applied only on bilingual text
p144
aVGanchev et al
p145
aVThe probabilistic model for dependency parsing defines a family of conditional probability p u'\u005cu039b' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) over all u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' given sentence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' , with a log-linear form
p146
aVBy using IGT Data, not only can we obtain more accurate word alignments, but also extract useful cross-lingual information for the resource-poor language
p147
aVThis optimization problem is typically solved using quasi-Newton numerical methods such as L-BFGS [ 36 ] , which requires efficient calculation of the objective function and the gradient of the objective function
p148
aVBut how can we define the transferring distribution for the parallel examples { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i t u'\u005cu2208' P }

aVMaximum likelihood training chooses parameters such that the log-likelihood L u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu039b' ) is maximized

aVIn our experiments, we train a Stanford POS Tagger [ 50 ] for each language
p152
aVT u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' ) is used to denote the set of possible dependency trees for sentence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99'
p153
aVWe denote the weight function of each edge e as follows
p154
aVThere are two advantages for this definition of the transferring weight
p155
aVThe total contribution of the unsupervised examples to K then simplifies to K U = u'\u005cu2211' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i u'\u005cu2208' U H u'\u005cu2062' ( p u'\u005cu039b' , i ) , which may be regarded as the entropy item used to constrain the model u'\u005cu2019' s uncertainty H to be low, as presented in the work on entropy regularization [ 20 , 28 ]

aVFor the gradient of K U , both the two multipliers of the second item in equation ( 15 ) can be computed using the same inside-outside algorithm
p158
aVFor the unlabeled examples { u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' i u'\u005cu2208' U } , some previous studies (e.g.,, [ 1 ] ) simply use a uniform distribution over labels (e.g.,, parses), to reflect that the label is unknown
p159
aVThe objective K function to be minimized is actually the expected negative log-likelihood
p160
aVWe use the standard splits of the treebank for each language as specified in the release of the data 7 7 https://code.google.com/p/uni-dep-tb/
p161
aVThe first item ( K P ) of the K u'\u005cu2032' function in equation ( 11 ) can be rewritten in the following form
p162
aVTaking the intersection of languages in the two kinds of resources yields the following seven languages
p163
aVThis scenario is applicable to a large set of languages and many research studies [ 19 ] have been made on it
p164
aVIn this paper, we will use the following notation u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' represents a generic input sentence, and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9a' represents a generic dependency tree

aVOne reasonable speedup, as presented in Smith and Eisner [ 44 ] , is to replace Shannon entropy with Rényi entropy
p170
aVTo summarize the description in the previous sections, our approach is performed in the following steps
p171
aVFor the other three languages, the improvements are remarkable, too u'\u005cu2014' 2.33% for French, 3.03% for Spanish and 3.40% for Swedish
p172
aVWe follow the method in Smith and Eisner [ 44 ] and take the transferring distribution p ~ i to be the actual current belief p u'\u005cu039b' , i

aVThen we run GIZA++ with the default setting to generate word alignments in both directions
p176
aVThis set consists of the following 12 coarse-grained tags
p177
aVThe average tagging accuracy is around 95%
p178
aVWith Rényi entropy, the computation of K U and its gradient is O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 3 ) , even for non-projective case
p179
aVIn practice we can use this kind of POS taggers to predict POS tags, whose tagging accuracy is around 85%
p180
aVAs mentioned in section 2.3 , the runtime to compute K U and its gradient is O u'\u005cu2062' ( n 4
p181
aVFurthermore, from a practical standpoint, it is rarely the case that we are completely devoid of resources for most languages
p182
aVWe then make the intersection of the word alignments of two directions to generate one-to-one alignments
