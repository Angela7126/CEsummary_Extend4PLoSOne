<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our contributions to the field are as follows we present a novel and efficient method for tackling the challenge of content selection using a ML classification approach; we applied this method to the domain of feedback summarisation; we present a comparison with an optimisation technique (Reinforcement Learning), and we discuss the similarities and differences between the two methods</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, our domain for feedback generation is motivated by previous studies [] who show that text summaries are more effective in decision making than graphs therefore it is advantageous to provide a summary over showing users the raw data graphically</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The difference between the two methods lies in that the collective content selection requires the consideration of an individual preference score (which is defined as the preference of the entity to be selected or omitted, and it is based on the values of entity attributes and is computed using a boosting algorithm) and the identification of links between the entities with similar labels</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The classification method reduces the generation steps, by making the decision of the factor selection and the template selection jointly</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Content selection is seen as a Markov Decision problem and the goal of the agent is to learn to take the sequence of actions that leads to optimal content selection</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Content selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in</a>
