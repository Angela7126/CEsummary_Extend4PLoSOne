<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The result is a new measure based on POS bigrams to assess ESL learners u'\u2019' mastery of syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The idea that the level of syntactic complexity (in terms of its range and sophistication) can be assessed based on the distribution of POS-tags is informed by prior studies in second language acquisition</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The syntactic complexity of a test spoken response was estimated based on its similarity to the proficiency groups in the reference corpus with respect to the score-specific constructions</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with</a>
