<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a secondary contribution of this paper, we demonstrate the applicability of unsupervised domain adaptation to the syntactic analysis of historical texts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Consequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing [ 25 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Both structure-aware domain adaptation algorithms perform as well as standard dropout u'\u2014' and better than the well-known structural correspondence learning (SCL) algorithm [ 1 ] u'\u2014' but structured dropout is more than an order-of-magnitude faster</a>
