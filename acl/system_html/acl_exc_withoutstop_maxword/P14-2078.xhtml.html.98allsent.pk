VThe annotation object is composed of information extracted from the document along with linguistic and semantic annotations as described hereafter
p1
aVBut if the IBM mention co-occurs with a Thomas Watson, Jr mention in the document, there will probably be more links between the International Business Machine and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages than between the International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages
p2
aVDocuments are processed by an annotator capable of producing POS tags for each word, as well as spans, NE surface forms, NE labels and ranked candidate Wikipedia URIs for each candidate NE
p3
aVThe idea is to evaluate in a set of candidate links which one is the most likely to be correct by taking the other links contained in the document into account
p4
aVWhen NE SF are spanned over several rows, these rows are merged into a single one
p5
aVSince the system focuses on NEs, rows with lexical units that do not belong to a NE SF are dropped from the annotation object, and NE SF are refined as described in [ 5 ]
p6
aVS 1 2 is associated to the International Business Machines Corporation , and S 2 1 to the Thomas Watson, Jr page dsr_score(URI 1 1 ) sums up the number of occurrences of URI 1 1 in S j 1 for all j u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , n ] ] - { 1 }
p7
aVSimilarly, dsr_score(URI 2 1 ) is equal to the number of times the International Business Machines Corporation is cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr page csr_score(URI 1 1 ) sums up the number of common URIs and categories between S 1 1 and S 2 1 , i.e., the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr pages csr_score(URI 2 1 ) counts the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Business Machines Corporation and Thomas Watson, Jr pages
p8
aVWe propose a mutual disambiguation algorithm that improves the accuracy of entity links in a document by using successive corrections applied to an annotation object representing this document
p9
aVGiven a query that consists of a document with a specified name mention of an entity, the task is to determine the correct node in the reference KB for the entity, adding a new node for the entity if it is not already in the reference KB
p10
aVThe second NE has a longer surface form than the first one, and its associated first rank URI is the most frequent
p11
aVHence, in the current example, dsr_score(URI 1 1 ) is the number of occurrences of URI 1 1 in S 2 1 , namely the number of times the International Brotherhood of Magicians are cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr page
p12
aVFor example, if a NE describes a city name like Paris , it is more probable that the correct link for this city name designates Paris (France) rather than Paris (Texas) if a neighbor entity offers candidate links semantically related to Paris (France) like the Seine river or the Champs-Elysées
p13
aVTo support the correction process based on co-reference chains, the system tries to correct NE labels for all the NEs listed in the annotation object
p14
aVAfter calculation, we have mutual_relation_score(URI 1 1 ) mutual_relation_score(URI 2 1 ) The candidate URIs for [ IBM ] are re-ranked accordingly, and International Business Machines Corporation becomes its first rank candidate
p15
aVThe ontology (like YAGO or DBPedia) provides a pre-existing set of potential relations between the entities to link (like for instance, in our previous example, Paris (France) has_river Seine ) that will be used to rank the best candidates according to their mutual presence in the document
p16
aVFor instance, names of places can be very common as is Paris, which refers to 26 different places in Wikipedia
p17
aVWe assumed the dsr_score was much more semantically significant than the csr_score, and translated this assumption in the weight calculation by introducing two correction parameters u'\u005cu0391' and u'\u005cu0392' used in the final scoring calculation
p18
aVThe input of the MDP is an annotation object u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' with n rows, obtained as explained in Section 3.1
p19
aVThus, we consider an annotation object u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , which is an array with a row for each NE, and columns storing related knowledge
p20
aVIf n NEs were annotated in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , then u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' has n rows
p21
aVThe NED problem is related to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem [ 16 ] , and is often more challenging since mentions of NEs can be highly ambiguous
p22
aVFor all i u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , n ] ] , k u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , l ] ] , we build the set S i k , composed of the Wikipedia URIs and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related to the URI stored in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' [ i ] u'\u005cu2062' [ k ] that we will refer to as URI k i to ease the reading
p23
aVIn more recent approaches, it is suggested that annotation processes based on similarity distance measures can be improved by making use of other annotations present in the same document
p24
aVSuch techniques are referred to as semantic relatedness [ 19 ] , collective disambiguation [ 12 ] , or joint disambiguation [ 8 ]
p25
aVFor all i u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , n ] ] , for each set of URIs { URI i k , u'\u005cu2005' k u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , l ] ] } , the re-ranking process is conducted according to the following steps
p26
aVDealing with ambiguity is one of the key difficulties in this task, since mentions are often highly polysemous, and potentially related to many different KB entries
p27
aVHence, the co-reference correction process will assign the right URI to the first NE ( URI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris ), which was wrongly linked to the actress Paris Hilton
p28
aVIf l candidate URIs are provided for each NE, then u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' has ( l + 4 ) columns c u , u u'\u005cu2208' { 1 , l + 4 }
p29
aVFor the sake of reproducibility, we applied the KBP scoring metric ( B 3 + F ) described in [ 20 ] , and we used the KBP scorer 1 1 http://www.nist.gov/tac/2013/KBP/EntityLinking/tools.html
p30
aVWe describe below some recent approaches proposed for solving the EL task
p31
aVIt uses bags of words to disambiguate semantic entities according to a cosine similarity algorithm
p32
aVHence, systems that attempt to address the NED problem must include disambiguation resources
p33
aVMore recently, several systems have been launched as web services dedicated to EL tasks
p34
aVThey are used as matching sequences to locate corresponding candidate entries in the KB, and then to disambiguate those candidates using similarity measures
p35
aVA strong effort has been conducted recently by the TAC-KBP evaluation task [ 13 ] to create standardized corpus, and annotation standards based on Wikipedia for evaluation and comparison of EL systems
p36
aVLately, [ 6 , 15 , 17 ] extended this framework by using richer features for similarity comparison
p37
aVThe three best results and the median from TAC-KBP 2012 systems are shown in the remaining columns for the sake of comparison
p38
aVIn MDP, for each Wikipedia URI candidate annotation, all the internal links and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related to this URI are collected
p39
aVCandidate NE annotations for this mention can be International Business Machine or International Brotherhood of Magicians
p40
aVFor a given NE, this weight is expected to measure the mutual relations of a candidate annotation with all the other candidate annotations of NEs in the document
p41
aVS 1 1 gathers URIs and categories contained in the International Brotherhood of Magicians Wikipedia page
p42
aVThe purpose of the MDP is to capture this semantic relatedness information contained in the graph of links extracted from Wikipedia pages related to each candidate annotation
p43
aVThe Mutual Disambiguation Process (MDP) relies on the graph of all the relations (internal links, categories) between Wikipedia content related to the document annotations
p44
aVURI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris NE surface form capital of France
p45
aV1) the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of candidates is replaced by internal links and categories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coherence of entities is improved prior to the calculation of semantic relatedness using a co-reference resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough to improve the performance of existing entity linking annotation engines, which are capable of providing a set of ranked candidates for each annotation in a document
p46
aVThe Entity Linking (EL) task consists in linking name mentions of named entities (NEs) found in a document to their corresponding entities in a reference Knowledge Base (KB
p47
aVFor each document u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , this knowledge is gathered in an array called annotation object , which has initially one row per document lexical unit
p48
aVURI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris NE surface form city of Paris - The [capital of France] is easy to reach by train
p49
aVSuch techniques mostly involve exploration of graphs resulting of all the candidate annotations proposed for a given document, and try to rank the best candidates for each annotation using an ontology
p50
aVFirst rank candidate URIs are corrected by a process that relies on co-reference chains found in the document
p51
aVThe use of Wikipedia for explicit disambiguation dates back to [ 2 ] who built a system that compared the context of a mention to the Wikipedia categories of an entity candidate
p52
aVThe NE label correction process assigns the same NE label to all the NEs associated with the same first rank URI

aV[ IBM ] URI 1 1 u'\u005cu2261' International Brotherhood of Magicians
p55
aVThe maximum number of candidate URIs is l = 15
p56
aVThen, for each set, NE labels are counted per type, and all the rows in a same set are updated with the most frequent NE label found in the set, i.e., all the NEs in this set are tagged with this label

p59
aVVarious approaches have been proposed to solve the named entity disambiguation (NED) problem
p60
aVThe extraction of an accurate link is a process occurring after the URI annotation of NEs in the whole document
p61
aVWe observe that the complete algorithm (co-references, named entity labels and MDP) provides the best results on PER NE links
p62
aVIn this task, mentions of entities found in a document collection must be linked to entities in a reference KB, or to new named entities discovered in the collection
p63
aVThis information will be used to calculate a weight for each of the l candidate URI annotations of each mention
p64
aVFor the first NE mention [ IBM ], u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' contains two candidate URIs identifying two different resources
p65
aVThe document contains two sentences, NE mentions are in bold
p66
aVAmong the NEs present in the document, the ones that co-refer are identified and clustered by logical rules applied to the content of the annotation object
p67
aVFor the second NE mention [ Thomas J
p68
aVThe system makes use of all the semantic content stored in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' to locally improve the precision of each URI annotation in the document
p69
aVThis URI is selected through a decision process that gives more weight to longer surface forms and frequent URIs
p70
aVThe co-reference detection is conducted using the information recorded in the annotation object
p71
aVFor all the rows in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , sets of rows with identical first rank URIs are considered
p72
aVWhile all these approaches focus on semantic relation between entities, their potential is limited by the separate mapping of candidate links for each mention
p73
aVThis is usually done using similarity measures (such as cosine similarity, weighted Jaccard distance, KL divergence u'\u005cu2026' ) that evaluate the distance between a bag of words related to a candidate annotation, and the words surrounding the entity to annotate in the text

p80
aVIn this paper we explore the capabilities of a disambiguation algorithm using all the available annotation layers of NEs to improve their links

p97
aVThe study showed that they perform differently on various essential aspects of EL tasks (mention detection, linking, disambiguation
p98
aVThese NEs can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), etc., and they are usually represented in the KB by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI
p99
aVBefore being processed by the disambiguation module, u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' is dynamically updated by correction processes
