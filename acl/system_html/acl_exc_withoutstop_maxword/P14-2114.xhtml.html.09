<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For each named entity occur in tweet u'\ud835' u'\udc98' , choose a named entity y u'\u223c' Multinomial ( u'\ud835' u'\udf3d' e )</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this model, we assume that each tweet message m u'\u2208' { 1 u'\u2062' M } is assigned to one event instance e , while e is modeled as a joint distribution over the named entities y , the date/time d when the event occurred, the location l where the event occurred and the event-related keywords k</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As illustrated in Figure 1 , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The number of events, E , in the LEM model is set to 25</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The graphical model of LEM is shown in Figure 2</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The other uses the traditional Stanford NER to extract named entities from news articles published in the same period and then perform fuzzy matching to identify named entities from tweets</a>
