<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Not surprisingly, Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson u'\u2019' s correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near non-existence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses</a>
