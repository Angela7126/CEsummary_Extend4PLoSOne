<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy the u'\u201c' no crossing links u'\u201d' constraint, and errors in punctuations may prevent correct word-word dependencies from being created (see section 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary</a>
