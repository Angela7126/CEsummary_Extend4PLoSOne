<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Now, when we use a coarse pruning pass, we are able to parse nearly 280 sentences per second, a 70% increase in parsing performance relative to Canny et al</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the coarse pass, we compute Viterbi inside and outside scores for every span</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>At the top level, our system first computes pruning masks with a coarse grammar</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, we have a coarse grammar, with many fewer rules and symbols</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The coarse to fine pruning approach of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) employs an X-bar grammar as its first pruning phase, but there is no reason why we cannot begin with a more complex grammar for our initial pass</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Figure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As shown in Table 1 , using a 1-split grammar as a coarse pass allows us to produce over 400 sentences per second, a full 2x improvement over our original system, and 2.5x over Canny et al</a>
