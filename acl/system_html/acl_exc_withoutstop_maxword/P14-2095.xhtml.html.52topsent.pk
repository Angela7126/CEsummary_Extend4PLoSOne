VOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification

aVWe did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their dimension when evaluated on source language u'\u005cu2013' in our experiments the performance of the monolingual classifier does not improve significantly if the dimension is increased past 300 and decreases only by a small margin (less than one absolute point) if it is reduced to 100
