<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Consequently, punctuations are not as consistently annotated in treebanks as words, making it harder to parse punctuations</a>
