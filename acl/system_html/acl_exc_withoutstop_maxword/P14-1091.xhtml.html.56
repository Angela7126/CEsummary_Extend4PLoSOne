<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Two question translation methods are presented in the rest of this subsection, which are based on question patterns and relation expressions respectively</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Algorithm 2 shows how to generate formal triples for a span u'\ud835' u'\udcac' based on question patterns ( u'\ud835' u'\udcac' u'\u2062' u'\ud835' u'\udcab' -based question translation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Algorithm 3 shows how to generate triples for a question u'\ud835' u'\udcac' based on relation expressions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note, question decomposition only operates on the original question and question spans covered by complete dependency subtrees</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Table 2 shows the statistics of question patterns and relation expressions used in our KB-QA system</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>From experiments (Table 3 in Section 4.3) we can see that, question pattern based question translation can achieve high end-to-end accuracy</a>
