<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It was set to 3 for the monolingual unigram model, and 2 for the bilingual unigram model, which provided slightly higher BLEU scores on the development set than the other settings</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This section describes our unified monolingual and bilingual UWS scheme</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In monolingual segmentation, the proposed methods with both unigram and bigram models were tested</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The time cost of the bilingual models is about 5 times that of the monolingual model, which is consistent with the complexity analysis in Section 3</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, bilingual approaches that model word probabilities suffer from computational complexity</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>To this end, we model bilingual UWS under a similar framework with monolingual UWS in order to improve efficiency, and replace Gibbs sampling with expectation maximization (EM) in training</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The monolingual bigram model, however, was slower to converge, so we started it from the segmentations of the unigram model,</a>
