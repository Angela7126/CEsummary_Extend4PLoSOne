<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We evaluate CoSimRank for the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The disadvantage of this similarity measure is significant and even more visible on bilingual lexicon extraction than on synonym extraction (see Table 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Synonym extraction is run on the English graph</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>4 ) for synonym extraction and the two-graph version (Eq</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Compared to PPR+cos, CoSimRank is roughly four times faster on synonym extraction and has comparable performance on lexicon extraction</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Compared to SimRank, CoSimRank is more than 40 times faster on synonym extraction and six times faster on lexicon extraction</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We use the basic version of CoSimRank (Eq</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For lexicon extraction, we use the same parameters as in the synonym extraction task for all four similarity measures</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The counteracting effects of fewer iterations and more vector similarity computations can give either CoSimRank or PPR+cos</a>
