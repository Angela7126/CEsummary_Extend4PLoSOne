<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic structure of those networks</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Instead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources [ 27 , 12 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The other two resources, i.e.,, wt and ow , do not provide a reliable network of semantic relations, therefore we used our ontologization approach to construct their corresponding semantic graphs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In Section 2 , we presented our approach for aligning lexical resources</a>
