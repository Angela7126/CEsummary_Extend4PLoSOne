VHowever, in domain cts, the improvement that word embeddings provide for word clusters is modest
p1
aVFor Brown word clusters, we directly apply the clustering trained by Plank and Moschitti [ Plank and Moschitti2013 ] to facilitate system comparison later
p2
aVRow 4 shows that word embedding itself is also very useful for domain adaptation in RE since it improves the baseline system for all the target domains
