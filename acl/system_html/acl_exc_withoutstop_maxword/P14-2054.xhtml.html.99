<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are two rules for merging spans one merges two complete spans into an incomplete span, the other merges an incomplete span and a complete span into a large complete span</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We can reversely get the the compressed parse tree by removing all virtual arcs from the full parse tree</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the right span is left-headed, there are two cases its leftmost word is kept, or no word in the span is kept</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The two complete spans must be single words, as the length of the virtual arc is 1</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A span is a subtree over a number of consecutive words, with the leftmost or the rightmost word as its root</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>According to the proposition above, if the right span is right-headed, its leftmost word is kept</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We drop the signature of the virtual arc number from each span, and thus obtain an O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) time algorithm</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then we augment these parse trees by adding virtual arcs and get the full parse trees of their corresponding original sentences</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An incomplete span denoted as I</a>
