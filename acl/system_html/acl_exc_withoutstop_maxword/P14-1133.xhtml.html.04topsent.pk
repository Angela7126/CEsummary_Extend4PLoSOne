VOur framework accommodates any paraphrasing method, and in this paper we propose an association model that learns to associate natural language phrases that co-occur frequently in a monolingual parallel corpus, combined with a vector space model , which learns to score the similarity between vector representations of natural language utterances (Section 5
p1
aVWe use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them
p2
aVOnce the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model
p3
aVGiven an utterance x and the KB, we construct a set of candidate logical forms u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb5' x , and then
