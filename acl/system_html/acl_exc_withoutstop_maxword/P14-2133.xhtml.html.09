<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding</a>

<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For OOV words which are not in the dictionary of embeddings, we back off to the unknown word model for the underlying parser</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Maryland parser builds on the state-splitting parser, replacing its basic word emission model with a feature-rich, log-linear representation of the lexicon</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To evaluate the vocabulary expansion hypothesis, we introduce a simple but targeted out-of-vocabulary (OOV) model in which every unknown word is simply replaced by its nearest neighbor in the training set</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Word embeddings are useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words, because they automatically ensure that unknown words are treated the same way as known words with similar representations</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It seems clear that word embeddings exhibit some syntactic structure</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Berkeley lexicon stores, for each latent (tag, word) pair, the probability p ( w t ) directly in a lookup table</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This paper investigates a variety of ways in which word embeddings might augment a constituency parser with a discrete state space</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This ensures that our model continues to include the original Berkeley parser model as a limiting case</a>
