<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The MWE analyzer is a CRF-based sequential labeler, which, given a tokenized text, jointly performs MWE segmentation and POS tagging (of simple tokens and of MWEs), both tasks mutually helping each other 9 9 Note that in our experiments, we use this analyzer for MWE analysis only, and discard the POS tagging prediction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So to sum up on the u'\u201c' labeled evaluation u'\u201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification</a>
