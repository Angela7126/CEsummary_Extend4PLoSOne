<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Overall, starting with a MAP of 26.1% as provided by the balanced [ breast cancer corpus 1 ] , we are able to increase it to 42.3% with the unbalanced [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] (the variation observed for some unbalanced corpora such as [ diabetes corpus 12, 13 and 14 ] can be explained by the fact that adding more data in the source language increases the error rate of the translation phase of the standard approach, which leads to the introduction of additional noise in the translated context vectors</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For a word to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Jaccard or Cosine (see equation 2 where a u'\u2062' s u'\u2062' s u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' c j i stands for u'\u201c' association score u'\u201d' , v k</a>
