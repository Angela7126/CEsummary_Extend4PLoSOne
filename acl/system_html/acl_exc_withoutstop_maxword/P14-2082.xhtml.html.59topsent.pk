p1
aVSince the annotation tool frees the annotators from the decision of when to label an edge, the focus is now what to label each edge
p2
aVGeneric Events finally, generic events were not skipped
p3
aVThey have the densest annotation, but u'\u005cu201c' the annotator was not required to annotate all pairs of event mentions, but as many as possible u'\u005cu201d' .This paper takes a different tack to annotation by requiring annotators to label every possible pair of events/times in a given window
p4
aVSince there were only 2 annotators for most documents (and since we require the majority of annotators to agree), in general, the vague label was applied to the final graph if either annotator chose it
p5
aVThe second facet is the focus of this paper when should an annotator label an ordering relation
