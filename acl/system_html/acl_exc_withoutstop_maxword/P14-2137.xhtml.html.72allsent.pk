VTo illustrate the detailed effects of the corpus latent features, Table 4 shows the ranks of correct Chinese translations for English relations by methods using selected features for the challenges
p1
aVThis research was supported by the MSIP (The Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning), Korea and Microsoft Research, under IT/SW Creative research program supervised by the NIPA(National IT Industry Promotion Agency
p2
aVTo address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1 ) [ 7 , 17 ]
p3
aVIn clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations
p4
aVOur baseline implementation uses the one by [ 11 ] , and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit
p5
aVIn contrast, we propose to explore corpus l atent f eatures (LF), to complement the sparsity problem of EF
p6
aVWe compare our hybrid approach, which is denoted by LF+EF with EF [ 11 ] , a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similarity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations [ 10 ] , and the seed translations Seed that we adopt [ 17 ] with PH+SM as a base translation matrix
p7
aVThe corpus explicit feature EF alone cannot translate the relation win and, in turn, u'\u005cu2018' Matthew Emmons u'\u005cu2019'
p8
aVIn contrast, Lee and Hwang () propose u'\u005cu201c' selective propagation u'\u005cu201d' for asymmetric graphs, of comparing the semantics of relations
p9
aVUnlike entities, we can easily observe the dissimilarity of the temporal distributions of semantically equivalent relations
p10
aVTo measure the effectiveness, we use a set of gold standard entity translation pairs which consist of 221 person entities and 52 organization entities
p11
aVWhile Step 3 is well-defined in [ 11 ] , to propagate entity translation scores when the relation semantics of the edges are equivalent, Step 2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e.,, co-occurring entities or shared context
p12
aVWe observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combining both features
p13
aVFor relations, such as visit, that involves diverse entities, the temporal distributions are highly noisy (Figure 5
p14
aVSelective propagation, leveraging the statements extracted from bilingual comparable corpora, can be summarized by several steps
p15
aVIn this section, we present experimental settings and results on translating entities using our proposed approaches
p16
aVEach relation translation method translates an English relation r E into a list of Chinese relations, and we check whether a Chinese relation r C with the highest translation score is the correct translation
p17
aVIn this paper, we illustrate such importance using named entity (NE) translation mining problem
p18
aVOut of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations
p19
aVIn addition, the lower ranked but correct relation translations also affect entity translation
p20
aVUnfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N
p21
aVTotal 3342 English-Chinese relation translation pairs returned by our method and the baselines are randomly shown and labeled
p22
aVWe normalize the obtained function values for each English relations using the top- k Chinese translations
p23
aVSpecifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as
p24
aVThat is, we can propagate the seed translation similarity of (Drunken Master, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈÜâÊã≥) to neighbor entities u'\u005cu2018' Jackie Chan u'\u005cu2019' and u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô u'\u005cu2019' in each graph
p25
aVFor example, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film u'\u005cu2018' Drunken Master u'\u005cu2019' ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈÜâÊã≥) in both graphs
p26
aVThis observation also holds in the bilingual environment by exploiting seed entity translations
p27
aVTherefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem
p28
aVNote that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh evaluation criteria) may look low
p29
aV3 3 Our results leveraging relational temporality outperforms the reported results using entity temporality on the same data set
p30
aVEarly research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation u'\u005cu2018' Mandelson u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊõºÂæ∑Â∞îÊ£Æ u'\u005cu2019' [ManDeErSen] with similar sounds [ 9 , 15 ]
p31
aVA key contribution of this paper is using relation temporality for determining relation equivalence
p32
aVIn this section, we present our approaches to obtain relations of equivalent semantics across languages (e.g.,, visit u'\u005cu2192' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆøÈóÆ
p33
aVThus, we cannot acquire any common entity pair like (Russia, aircraft carrier) for deploy and {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (deploy at
p34
aVThe existence of a common entity pair using the seed entity translations (boolean
p35
aVThe entity translation score obtained in the previous iteration or the seed entity translation score
p36
aVAs shown in Figure 5 , d [ e , r , * ] is more distinctive and hence a key clue to find semantically equivalent relations
p37
aVWe extract English and Chinese statements from news articles in 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in both English and Chinese, which were also used by Lee and Hwang
p38
aVIn this section, we evaluate the proposed approach on the entity translation task and the relation translation task
p39
aVAdditionally, we use the following features to consider absolute frequencies f u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' q u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) of textual elements as well because 1) we are more confident with more evidence and 2) in the comparable corpora, the equivalent elements are likely to show similar frequencies
p40
aVTherefore, even lower-performing EF boosted the entity translations, and in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1-score in the entity translation task
p41
aVBy aggregating coupling similarities, we measure the translation score of two relations
p42
aVOur new hybrid approach significantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score
p43
aVTherefore, we leverage relation temporality , which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality [ 8 , 6 , 16 ]
p44
aVAs we can see from the difference in the numbers of the documents, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations
p45
aVStep 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place
p46
aVBruce Willis, star in, The Sixth Sense) and ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂ∏ÉÈ≤ÅÊñØ u'\u005cu22c5' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂ®ÅÂà©ÊñØ (Bruce Willis), {CJK*} UTF8zhfs‰∏ªÊºî (star in), {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠ÊÑü (The Sixth Sense
p47
aVBut the top translations are still relevant (e.g.,, fight is translated to {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈ©ª (deploy troops
p48
aVWe identify the three big challenges in exploiting the temporality in relation translations
p49
aVMore specifically, we exploit a coupling of a relation and an entity d [ e , r , * ] where e is an entity, r a relation, and * is a placeholder indicating that any noun phrase is accepted for the second argument of a statement
p50
aVIn particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation understanding in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2
p51
aVIn this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF [ 11 ]
p52
aVHowever, in some cases like ratify, highly related relations may induce noise
p53
aVWe measure precision, recall, and F1-score based on the returned translation pairs for each English entity as it is done in [ 11 ]
p54
aVStep 2 and Step 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function
p55
aVThe two approaches using temporality are orthogonal and can be aggregated, which we leave as our future directions
p56
aVUnderstanding relations is important in entity tasks
p57
aV[C3] Lastly, we have to eliminate false positives in relation temporality
p58
aVTo illustrate, two relations deploy and {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (deploy at) have similar temporal behaviors (Figure 5
p59
aVAs we mentioned in the introduction, traditional approaches leverage common co-occurring entity-pairs
p60
aVWhen two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and u'\u005cu201c' blind propagation u'\u005cu201d' described above is effective
p61
aVIn general, LF†can translate more relations (e.g.,, support and capture
p62
aVOur approach using the entity-relation coupling similarity feature for [C1] alone often cannot find the correct translations
p63
aVThis section considers the relation translation task
p64
aVWe exploit the temporal distribution d u'\u005cu2062' [ x ] u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) of textual element x during t -th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly basis, and normalize them to observe u'\u005cu2211' t d u'\u005cu2062' [ x ] u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) = 1
p65
aVIn our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach [ 17 ] with [ 10 ] for a base translation matrix
p66
aVTable 3 shows the comparisons of†LF,†EF and their hybrid†LF+EF
p67
aVWe can clearly see that LF†shows higher recall than EF while EF†shows higher precision
p68
aVWe will discuss the detailed procedure of Step 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3
p69
aVFor comparison, the ranks of the correct translations when using EF are shown
p70
aVTo address this, we check the common co-occurring entity pair of the relations
p71
aVFor Step 1 , an existing method for entity translation is adopted
p72
aV[C2] Considering entity-relation coupling distribution d [ e , r , * ] alone is not sufficient due to the domination of individual temporality
p73
aVKnowing a few seed entity translations using T N , u'\u005cu2018' Bruce Willis u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂ∏ÉÈ≤ÅÊñØ u'\u005cu22c5' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂ®ÅÂà©ÊñØ u'\u005cu2019' and u'\u005cu2018' The Sixth Sense u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÁ¨¨ÂÖ≠ÊÑü u'\u005cu2019' , we can find star in and {CJK*} UTF8zhfs‰∏ªÊºî are semantically similar
p74
aVWe process one iteration of the entire framework ( Step 1-3 ) for both LF+EF and EF
p75
aVFor example, Figure 5 shows the relation temporal distribution d [ visit ] ( t ) against week t
p76
aVTable 1 shows the examples of relations and their translations
p77
aVFormally, our goal is to build the relation translation score function T R u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) for English relation r E and Chinese relation r C
p78
aVHowever, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' WTO u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfs‰∏ñË¥∏ÁªÑÁªá u'\u005cu2019' [ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' Jackie Chan u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô u'\u005cu2019' [ChengLong]
p79
aVTable 2 shows the comparison of the methods
p80
aVFor example, we can obtain u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d' , but not u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed at ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤) an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d'
p81
aVExisting work [ 14 , 12 , 11 ] uses only co-occurring entity pairs, or e xplicit f eatures (EF
p82
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' Matthew Emmons u'\u005cu2019' is a lesser known entity, and we have only few statements mentioning him in the corpora
p83
aVOur proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1-score than the baselines
p84
aVThus, we produce the hybrid relation translation, and we empirically set u'\u005cu039b' = 0.4
p85
aVWe find that LF†and†EF†are complementary
p86
aVT N u'\u005cu2062' ( e E , e C ) u'\u005cu2265' u'\u005cu0398' } with u'\u005cu0398' = 0.6 , a set of translation pairs obtained in the seeds or previous iteration such as (Bush, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂ∏É‰ªÄ
p87
aVThe focus of this paper is Step 2 , building the translation score T R ( t ) u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) of English relation r E and Chinese relation r C
p88
aVTo address the first challenge, we use a finer-granularity unit for observing the temporality
p89
aVNote that we omit t for readability in the following sections
p90
aVBased on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF
p91
aVThat is, we always {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) before we {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊâπÂáÜ (ratify) something and hence the temporal behavior of {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) is also very similar to that of ratify
p92
aVIf an entity has a peak at some period (Figure 8 ), most relations that are coupled with the entity would have a peak at the very same period (Figure 8
p93
aV1 1 We use both d [ e , r , * ] and d [ * , r , e ] to measure the relation translation scores and leverage the average score

p98
aVWith these features, we measure the similarity of a pair of couplings as follows
p99
aVWe consider the relation translation is correct when the semantics are equivalent
p100
aVThe existing approaches are variations of using
p101
aVCompute the translation score T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) by aggregating the coupling similarities
p102
aVThis makes all relations that appear with this entity very similar to each other regardlessly of semantics
p103
aVHowever, the first relation takes [person], but the second relation [location] for the second argument
p104
aVTheir hybrid LF+EF has both high precision and recall, thus has the highest F1-score
p105
aVInitialize entity translation function T N ( 0 )
p106
aVOn the other hand, it can be correctly translated using†EF
p107
aVThe number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031
p108
aVHowever, LF+EF translates him correctly into {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈ©¨‰øÆ¬∑ÂüÉËíôÊñØ through the relation win
p109
aVAs we emphasized in Section 3.3 , we can see their complementary property
p110
aVFor example, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂéª (leave for/go to) is a correct translation of leave for, but {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÁ¶ªÂºÄ (leave) is not
p111
aVIn particular, our approach outperforms EF
p112
aVBut using all features removes such noise
p113
aVWe compute the similarity of two relations r E in English and r C in Chinese using the following 2-steps
p114
aVRepeat Step 2 and Step 3
p115
aV[C1] Considering temporal distributions d u'\u005cu2062' [ r ] of relations alone is not sufficient

aVTo address this challenge, we use features to measure whether d [ e , r , * ] is too close to either of d u'\u005cu2062' [ e ] or d u'\u005cu2062' [ r ]

aVBuild relation translation function T R ( t ) using T N ( t )
p126
aVConsidering the three challenges, we produce a list of features { f x u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C , e E , e C ) } to measure the coupling similarity S C u'\u005cu2062' P u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C , e E , e C ) as follows
p127
aVThe temporal similarity of the couplings, where J u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' D u'\u005cu2062' ( P , Q ) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence of two distributions P and Q , defined as J S D ( P , Q ) = 1 2 D ( P
p128
aVBut in this section, we only use d [ e , r , * ] for readability
p129
aVH u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C for an English relation r E and a Chinese relation r C
p130
aVFor example, let us say that we have two extracted statements

aVf F u'\u005cu2062' W , E , f F u'\u005cu2062' W , C u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' u'\u005cu2062' ( f u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' q u'\u005cu2062' ( e E , r E ) ) and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' u'\u005cu2062' ( f u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' q u'\u005cu2062' ( e C , r C ) u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) is a normalization function, for which we use a sigmoid function over a linear transformation of x
p132
aVThat is, for ( r E , r C ) , we redefine the score as T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) / u'\u005cu2211' i u'\u005cu2208' [ 1 , k ] T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i ) where r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i is the i -th rank Chinese relation for r E by Equation 2
