VAs the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction
p1
aVAssuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings
p2
aVAccordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning
p3
aVInstead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT
p4
aVIn decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation candidate selection
p5
aVThis indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings
p6
aVTherefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase
p7
aVBesides using the semantic similarities to prune the phrase table, we also employ them as two informative features like the phrase translation probability to guide translation hypotheses selection during decoding
p8
aVAs translation equivalents share the same semantic meaning, we employ high-quality phrase translation pairs as training corpus in this work
p9
aVWith the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate
p10
aVTherefore, our model can be easily adapted to learn semantic phrase embeddings using paraphrases
p11
aVIf we learn the embedding of the Chinese phrase correctly, we can regard it as the gold representation for the English phrase and use it to guide the process of learning English phrase embedding
p12
aVBesides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual question answering, since the semantic similarity between phrases in different languages can be calculated accurately
p13
aVTherefore, the semantic similarities computed using our BRAE model are complementary to the existing four translation probabilities
p14
aVThe models using word embeddings as the direct inputs to DNN cannot make full use of the whole syntactic and semantic information of the phrasal translation rules
p15
aVThus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings
p16
aVThe phrase translation probability is based on co-occurrence statistics and the lexical weights consider the phrase as bag-of-words
p17
aVIn contrast, our BRAE model learns the semantic meaning for each phrase no matter whether it is short or relatively long
p18
aVIn our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs
p19
aVTherefore, we can imagine that learning semantic phrase embedding is reasonable if we are given gold vector representations of the phrases
p20
aVSince word embeddings for two languages are learned separately and locate in different vector space, we do not enforce the phrase embeddings in two languages to be in the same semantic vector space
p21
aVThe core idea behind is that a phrase and its correct translation should share the same semantic meaning
p22
aVIn contrast, our BRAE model focuses on compositional semantics from words to phrases
p23
aVInstead, our bilingually-constrained recursive auto-encoders not only learn the composition mechanism of generating phrases from words, but also fine tune the word embeddings during the model training stage, so that we can induce the full information of the phrases and internal words
p24
aVWe can make inference from this fact that if a model can learn the same embedding for any phrase pair sharing the same meaning, the learned embedding must encode the semantics of the phrases and the corresponding model is our desire
p25
aVHowever, this kind of phrase embedding is hard to capture full semantics since the context of a phrase is limited
p26
aVTherefore, in order to successfully apply DNN to model the whole translation process, such as modelling the decoding process, learning compact vector representations for the basic phrasal translation units is the essential and fundamental work
p27
aVObviously, these methods of learning phrase embeddings either focus on some aspects of the phrase (e.g., reordering pattern), or impose strong assumptions (e.g., bag-of-words or indivisible n -gram
p28
aVAccordingly, our BRAE model is trained on Chinese and English
p29
aVIn experiments, we discard the phrase pair whose similarity in two directions are smaller than a threshold 3 3 To avoid the situation that all the translation candidates for a source phrase are pruned, we always keep the first 10 best according to the semantic similarity
p30
aVAccordingly, we propose the Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE), whose basic goal is to minimize the semantic distance between the phrases and their translations
p31
aVHowever, in the conventional (phrase-based) SMT, phrases are the basic translation units
p32
aVThe third method views any phrase as the meaningful composition of its internal words
p33
aVAnd then, they fine-tune the RAE according to the label of the phrase, such as the syntactic category in parsing (Socher et al., 2013a), the polarity in sentiment analysis [ 23 , 24 ] , and the reordering pattern in SMT [ 16 ]
p34
aVIn fact, the phrases having the same meaning are translation equivalents in different languages, but are paraphrases in one language
p35
aVSeveral researchers extend the original RAEs to a semi-supervised setting so that the induced phrase embedding can predict a target label, such as polarity in sentiment analysis [ 23 ] , syntactic category in parsing [ 21 ] and phrase reordering pattern in SMT [ 16 ]
p36
aVThese algorithms are based on corpus statistics including co-occurrence statistics, phrase pair usage and composition information
p37
aVWe know from the semi-supervised phrase embedding that the learned vector representation can be well adapted to the given label
p38
aVThe experiments show that up to 72% of the phrase table can be discarded without significant decrease on the translation quality, and in decoding with phrasal semantic similarities up to 1.7 BLEU score improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline can be achieved
p39
aVWhen the two algorithms using a similar portion of the phrase table 4 4 In the future, we will compare the performance by enforcing the two algorithms to use the same portion of phrase table (35% in BRAE and 36% in Significance), the BRAE-based algorithm outperforms the Significance algorithm on all the test sets except for MT04
p40
aVWe suppose there is a transformation between the two semantic embedding spaces
p41
aVFurthermore, our model is much more intuitive because it is directly based on the semantic similarity
p42
aVAs shown in Table 2, no matter what n is, the BRAE model can significantly improve the translation quality in the overall test data
p43
aVFortunately, we know the fact that the two phrases should share the same semantic representation if they express the same meaning
p44
aVSecond, even though we have no correct semantic phrase representation as the gold label, the phrases sharing the same meaning provide an indirect but feasible way
p45
aVWe prefer to the second one since this kind of word embedding has already encoded some semantics of the words
p46
aVAssuming the target phrase representation p t is available, the optimization of the source-side parameters is similar to that of semi-supervised RAE
p47
aVThis procedure can be performed with an co-training style algorithm so as to minimize the semantic distance between the translation equivalents 1 1 For simplicity, we do not show non-translation pairs here
p48
aVThe SMT evaluation is conducted on Chinese-to-English translation
p49
aVFurthermore, this method can only account for a very small part of phrases, since most of the phrases are compositional
p50
aVSuppose we are given a positive example ( s , t ) , the correct translation t can be converted into a bad translation t u'\u005cu2032' by replacing the words in t with randomly chosen target language words
p51
aVThe recursive auto-encoder is typically adopted to learn the way of composition [ 22 , 23 , 21 , 24 , 16 ]
p52
aVThus, the semantic distance is bidirectional the distance between p t and the transformation of p s , and that between p s and the transformation of p t
p53
aVBy optimizing the above objective, the phrases in the vector embedding space will be grouped according to the labels
p54
aVAs a result, the overall semantic error becomes
p55
aVDue to the powerful capacity of feature learning and representation, Deep (multi-layer) Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved a great success in speech and image processing [ 13 , 15 , 6 ]
p56
aVIn order to investigate the influence of the dimensionality of the embedding space, we have tried three different settings n = 50 , 100 , 200
p57
aVMost of these works attempt to improve some components in SMT based on word embedding , which converts a word into a dense, low dimensional, real-valued vector representation [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 20 ]
p58
aVWe thank Nan Yang for sharing the baseline code and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments
p59
aVHowever, the current model cannot guarantee this since the above semantic error E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( s t , u'\u005cu0398' ) only accounts for positive ones
p60
aVWe thus enhance the semantic error with both positive and negative examples, and the corresponding max-semantic-margin error becomes
p61
aVAssuming we are given a phrase w 1 u'\u005cu2062' w 2 u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu22ef' u'\u005cu2062' w m , it is first projected into a list of vectors ( x 1 , x 2 , u'\u005cu22ef' , x m ) using Eq
p62
aVIn parameter initialization, u'\u005cu0398' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' c and u'\u005cu0398' s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m for the source language is randomly set according to a normal distribution
p63
aVTermination Check if the joint error reaches a local minima or the iterations reach the pre-defined number (25 is used in our experiments), we terminate the training procedure, otherwise we set p s = p s u'\u005cu2032' , p t = p t u'\u005cu2032' , and go to step 2
p64
aVUsing the above error function, we need to construct a negative example for each positive example
p65
aVIn order to apply this auto-encoder to each pair of children, the representation of the parent p should have the same dimensionality as the c i u'\u005cu2019' s
p66
aVCase-insensitive BLEU is employed as the evaluation metric
p67
aVTo assess how well the parent u'\u005cu2019' s vector represents its children, the standard auto-encoder reconstructs the children in a reconstruction layer
p68
aV2 again to compute y 2 by setting the children to be [ c 1 ; c 2 ] = [ y 1 ; x 3 ]
p69
aVNIST MT04-06 and MT08 (news data) are used as the test data
p70
aVThe NIST MT03 is used as the development data
p71
aVWith the semantic phrase embeddings and the vector space transformation function, we apply the BRAE to measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates in the phrase-based SMT
p72
aVIn phrase table pruning, we discard the phrasal translation rules with low semantic similarity
p73
aVAlthough we also follow the composition-based phrase embedding, we are the first to focus on the semantic meanings of the phrases and propose a bilingually-constrained model to induce the semantic information and learn transformation of the semantic space in one language to the other
p74
aVSimilarly, non-translation pairs should have different semantic meanings, and this information can also be used to guide learning semantic phrase embeddings
p75
aVThis kind of semi-supervised phrase embedding is in fact performing phrase clustering with respect to the phrase label
p76
aVFor instance, the semantic phrase embeddings can be directly fed to DNN to model the decoding process
p77
aVIn contrast, our method attempts to learn the semantic vector representation for any phrase
p78
aVObviously, this kind methods of semi-supervised phrase embedding do not fully address the semantic meaning of the phrases
p79
aVIdeally, we want the learned BRAE model can make sure that the semantic error for the positive example (a source phrase s and its correct translation t ) is much smaller than that for the negative example (the source phrase s and a bad translation t u'\u005cu2032'
p80
aVTwo tasks are involved in the experiments phrase table pruning that discards entries whose semantic similarity is very low and decoding with the phrasal semantic similarities as additional new features
p81
aVHowever, no gold semantic phrase embedding exists
p82
aVTypically, four translation probabilities are adopted in the phrase-based SMT, including phrase translation probability and lexical weights in both directions
p83
aV2011 ) make the phrase embeddings capture the sentiment information
p84
aVTo have a better intuition about the power of the BRAE model at learning semantic phrase embeddings, we show some examples in Table 3
p85
aVGiven the BRAE model and the phrase training set, we search from the set the most semantically similar English phrases for any new input English phrase
p86
aVOne method considers the phrases as bag-of-words and employs a convolution model to transform the word embeddings to phrase embeddings [ 4 , 12 ]
p87
aVKalchbrenner and Blunsom ( 2013 ) utilize a simple convolution model to generate phrase embeddings from word embeddings
p88
aVIn this paper, we explore the phrase embedding, which represents a phrase (sequence of words) with a real-valued vector
p89
aVIn this way, the result Chinese and English phrase embeddings will capture the semantics as much as possible
p90
aVIn the semi-supervised RAE for phrase embedding, the objective function over a (phrase, label) pair ( x , t ) includes the reconstruction error and the prediction error, as illustrated in Fig
p91
aV2013 ) attempt to encode the reordering pattern in the phrase embeddings
p92
aVIt tries to minimize the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximize the semantic distance between non-translation pairs simultaneously
p93
aVTo obtain high-quality bilingual phrase pairs to train our BRAE model, we perform forced decoding for the bilingual training sentences and collect the phrase pairs used
p94
aVThe word embeddings will be fine-tuned in our BRAE model to capture much more semantics
p95
aVFor example, in the RAE-based phrase reordering model for SMT [ 16 ] , the phrases with the similar reordering tendency (e.g., monotone or swap) are close to each other in the embedding space, such as the prepositional phrases
p96
aVIt indicates that our BRAE model is a good alternative for phrase table pruning
p97
aVIn addition, our semantic phrase embeddings have many other potential applications
p98
aVGiven a phrase pair ( s , t ) , the BRAE model first obtains their semantic phrase representations ( p s , p t ) , and then transforms p s into target semantic space p s * , p t into source semantic space p t *
p99
aV2013 ) enable the phrase embeddings to mainly capture the syntactic knowledge
p100
aVAnd the semi-supervised phrase embedding [ 23 , 21 , 16 ] further indicates that phrase embedding can be tuned with respect to the label
p101
aVThen, they regard these phrases as indivisible units, and learn their embeddings with the context information
p102
aVFurthermore, a transformation function between the Chinese and English semantic spaces can be learned as well
p103
aV2013 ) also use bag-of-words but learn BLEU sensitive phrase embeddings
p104
aVOur work has the same objective, but instead of using corpus statistics, we attempt to measure the quality of the phrase pair from the view of semantic meaning
p105
aVRecently, statistical machine translation (SMT) community has seen a strong interest in adapting and applying DNN to many tasks, such as word alignment [ 29 ] , translation confidence estimation [ 19 , 18 , 31 ] , phrase reordering prediction [ 16 ] , translation modelling [ 1 , 12 ] and language modelling [ 7 , 26 ]
p106
aVIn the other direction, the Chinese phrase embedding can be learned in the same way
p107
aVIn phrase embedding using composition, the word vector representation is the basis and serves as the input to the neural network
p108
aVWhere the source-side error given the target phrase representation includes reconstruction error and updated semantic error
p109
aVA 5-gram language model is trained on the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword corpus and the English part of bilingual training data
p110
aV1, the Chinese phrase on the left and the English phrase on the right are translations with each other
p111
aVPre-training applying unsupervised phrase embedding with standard RAE to pre-train the source- and target-side phrase representations p s and p t respectively (Section 2.1.2);
p112
aVIn addition to the cross-lingual applications, we believe the BRAE model can be applied in many monolingual NLP tasks which depend on good phrase representations or semantic similarity between phrases, such as named entity recognition, parsing, textual entailment, question answering and paraphrase detection
p113
aVPruning most of the phrase table without much impact on translation quality is very important for translation especially in environments where memory and time constraints are imposed
p114
aVWhen the phrase becomes longer, the unsupervised RAE cannot even capture the syntactic property
p115
aVThe monolingual data contains 1.06B words for Chinese and 1.12B words for English
p116
aVThe table shows that the unsupervised RAE can at most capture the syntactic property when the phrases are short
p117
aVThe final BRAE objective over the phrase pairs training set ( S , T ) becomes
p118
aVFor example, as each node in the recursive auto-encoder shares the same weight matrix, the BRAE model would become weak at learning the semantic representations for long sentences with tens of words
p119
aVThe hyper-parameters in the BRAE model include the dimensionality of the word embedding n in Eq
p120
aVBesides SMT, the semantic phrase embeddings can be used in other cross-lingual tasks (e.g., cross-lingual question answering) and monolingual applications such as textual entailment, question answering and paraphrase detection
p121
aVIn addition, we pre-train the word embedding with toolkit Word2Vec on large-scale monolingual data including the aforementioned data for SMT
p122
aVFor the phrase pair ( s , t ) , the joint error is
p123
aVThe overall error of the BRAE model is employed to guide the search procedure

aV2 semantic error E s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( s , t ; u'\u005cu0398' what is the semantic distance between the learned vector representations p s and p t
p125
aVIn some previous works, phrase embedding has been discussed from different views
p126
aVFor example, the significance pruning, which is proven to be a very effective algorithm, computes the probability named p-value, that tests whether a source phrase s and a target phrase t co-occur more frequently in a bilingual corpus than they happen just by chance
p127
aVSpecifically, the Significance algorithm can safely discard 64% of the phrase table at its threshold 12 with only 0.1 BLEU loss in the overall test
p128
aVIn contrast, our BRAE-based algorithm can remove 72% of the phrase table at its threshold 0.7 with only 0.06 BLEU loss in the overall evaluation
p129
aVThe hyper-parameter u'\u005cu0391' weights the reconstruction and semantic error
p130
aVAnother method [ 20 ] deals with the phrases having a meaning that is not a simple composition of the meanings of its individual words, such as New York Times
p131
aVIn this work, we employ the toolkit Word2Vec [ 20 ] to pre-train the word embedding for the source and target languages
p132
aVSocher et al
p133
aVSocher et al
p134
aVThe input phrases contain different number of words
p135
aVGiven a phrase which is an ordered list of m words, each word has an index i into the columns of the embedding matrix L
p136
aVFirst, the recursive auto-encoder provides a reasonable composition mechanism to embed each phrase
p137
aVThe RAE learns the vector representation of the phrase by recursively combining two children vectors in a bottom-up manner [ 23 ]
p138
aVFor unsupervised phrase embedding, the only objective is to minimize the sum of reconstruction errors at each node in the optimal binary tree
p139
aVWe will first briefly present the unsupervised phrase embedding, and then describe the semi-supervised framework
p140
aVUnlike previous methods, the BRAE model jointly learns two RAEs (Fig

aVFine-tuning with the BRAE model, using target-side phrase representation p t to update the source-side parameters u'\u005cu0398' s and obtain the fine-tuned source-side phrase representation p s u'\u005cu2032' , and meanwhile using p s to update u'\u005cu0398' t and get the fine-tuned p t u'\u005cu2032' , and then calculate the joint error over the training corpus;
p142
aV2013 ) consider a phrase as an indivisible n -gram

p144
aVAfter learning word embeddings with DNN [ 2 , 5 , 20 ] , each word in the vocabulary V corresponds to a vector x u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n , and all the vectors are stacked into an embedding matrix L u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n ◊
p145
aVRecently, phrase embedding has drawn more and more attention
p146
aVWe can see a common phenomenon in both of the algorithms for the first few thresholds, the phrase table becomes smaller and smaller while the translation quality is not much decreased, but the performance jumps a lot at a certain threshold (16 for Significance pruning, 0.8 for BRAE-based one
p147
aVTable 1 shows the comparison results between our BRAE-based pruning method and the significance pruning algorithm

aVTo have a deep understanding of the parameters, we rewrite Eq
p220
aVThen, the derivatives for the parameters in the fixed binary tree will be calculated via backpropagation through structures [ 10 ]

aVE s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m ( t s , u'\u005cu0398' ) can be calculated in exactly the same way
p228
aVWe draw u'\u005cu0391' from 0.05 to 0.5 with step 0.05, and u'\u005cu039b' u'\u005cu2062' s from { 10 - 6 , 10 - 5 , 10 - 4 , 10 - 3 , 10 - 2 }

aVFinally, we choose u'\u005cu0391' = 0.15 , u'\u005cu039b' L = 10 - 2 , u'\u005cu039b' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' c = 10 - 3 and u'\u005cu039b' s u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' m = 10 - 3
p231
aVIt seems a paradox that updating u'\u005cu0398' s needs p t while updating u'\u005cu0398' t needs p s
