<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w</a>
