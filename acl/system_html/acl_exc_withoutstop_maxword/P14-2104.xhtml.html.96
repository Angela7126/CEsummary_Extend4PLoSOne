<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Besides these morphological features, we also employ latent continuous and discrete morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As our experiments below show, these features improve performance by dealing with sparsity issues</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Agglutinative languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish are computationally difficult due to word-form sparsity, variable word order, and the challenge of using rich morphological features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Korean-specific features are built upon the morphological analysis of the suffix agglutination of the current word x i</a>
