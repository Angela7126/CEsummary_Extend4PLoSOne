VTable 5 presents the results of the best single parser on the LTH conversion (ZPar) with gold and automatic POS tags in the first two rows
p1
aVIn all the experiments we employed a baseline feature set using word forms and parts of speech, and an enriched feature set (WordNet or clusters
p2
aVFor example, ZPar u'\u005cu2019' s LAS score on the LTH conversion drops from 90.45% with gold POS tags to 89.12% with automatic POS tags
p3
aVFor all the tests, we used a perceptron POS-tagger [] , trained on WSJ sections 2 u'\u005cu2013' 21, to assign POS tags automatically to both the training (using 10-way jackknifing) and test data, obtaining a POS tagging accuracy of 97.32% on the test data
p4
aVWe firstly tested the addition of each individual semantic feature to each parser, evaluating its contribution to the parser u'\u005cu2019' s performance
