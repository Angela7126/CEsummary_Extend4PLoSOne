VThis section describes our event causality extraction method
p1
aVFor the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u005cu27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u005cu27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1
p2
aVSection 3.3 shows how to rank event causality candidates
p3
aVWe then estimated that, with the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality candidates, among which the estimated number of positive examples is 377,794
p4
aVTo favor the baselines for fairness, the event causality candidates of the development and test data were restricted to those with excitation values
p5
aVHowever, as described in Section 1 , our event causality criteria are different; since they regarded phrase pairs that were not self-contained as event causality (their annotators checked the original sentences of phrase pairs to see if they were event causality), their judgments tended to be more lenient than ours, which explains the performance difference
p6
aVSection 3.1 describes how to extract event causality candidates, and Section 3.2 details our features
p7
aVWe applied our event causality extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Section 3.1 ) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs from them (See Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-event-causality in the supplementary notes for examples
p8
aVWe acquired 43,697 excitation templates by Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method and the manual annotation of excitation template candidates
p9
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method
p10
aVFor context feature extraction, the event causality candidates are accompanied by the original sentences from which they were extracted
p11
aVWe only keep the event causality candidates each phrase of which consists of excitation templates , which have been shown to be effective for causality extraction [ 12 ] and other semantic NLP tasks [ 19 ]
p12
aVProposed , our scenario generation method without the two filters, Proposed+Orig , our method with the original sentence filter, Proposed+Orig+Comm , our method with the original sentence and common argument filters, and Exact , a method that chains event causality by exact matching
p13
aVAnnotators regarded as event causality only phrase pairs that were interpretable as event causality without contexts (i.e.,, self-contained
p14
aVNext we compared our method with the baselines based on Hashimoto et al
p15
aVNext we describe our experiments on event causality extraction and show (a) that most of our features are effective and (b) that our method outperforms the baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ]
p16
aVOur method achieved 70% precision at 13% recall; we can extract about 69,700 event causality pairs with 70% precision, as described below
p17
aVOur evaluation is based on average precision ; 9 9 It is obtained by computing the precision for each point in the ranked list where we find a positive sample and averaging all the precision figures [ 18 ] we believe that it is important to rank the plausible event causality candidates higher
p18
aVProposed is our method
p19
aVWe compared our method and two baselines based on Do et al
p20
aVProposed is our proposed method
p21
aVThese datasets were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who annotated the event causality candidates without looking at the original sentences
p22
aVAn original sentence filter removes a scenario if two event causality pairs that are chained in it are extracted from original sentences between which no word overlap exists other than words constituting causality pairs
p23
aVTable 6 shows the average precision of the compared methods
p24
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates in Section 3.1
p25
aVTable 7 shows the average precision of the compared methods
p26
aVAfter applying additional filters (see Section LABEL:A-sec:filtering-conditions in the supplementary notes) including those based on a stop-word list and a causal connective list to remove unlikely event causality candidates that are not removed by the above filter, we finally acquired 2,451,254 event causality candidates
p27
aVshows our semantic relation features
p28
aVFrom the training data, our method seemed to successfully learn what self-contained event causality is
p29
aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
p30
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates
p31
aVTable 3 shows the results of removing the semantic relation, the context, and the association features from our method
p32
aVWe applied the excitation filter to all 272,025,401 event causality candidates from the web and 132,528,706 remained
p33
aVOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p34
aVExperiments using 600 million web pages [ 2 ] show that our method outperforms baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ] by more than 19% of average precision
p35
aVBase features represent the basic properties of event causality like nouns, templates, and their excitation polarities (See Section LABEL:A-sec:base-features in the supplementary notes
p36
aVWe require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted
p37
aVTo increase the number of acceptable scenarios, our method identifies compatibility w.r.t causality between two phrases by a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation [ 12 ] , which properly relaxes the chaining condition (Section 3.1 describes it
p38
aVBinary pattern of our semantic relations that co-occurs with two nouns of an event causality candidate in our web corpus
p39
aVDo et al used it (along with discourse relations) to extract event causality
p40
aVThe experiments in Section 5.1.1 show that not only Causation and Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) but the other relations are also effective for event causality extraction
p41
aVMany phrase pairs described two events that often happen in parallel but are not event causality (e.g., reduce the intake of energy and increase the energy consumption ) in the highly ranked event causality candidates of Cs u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s and Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p
p42
aVDefinition-based features , as detailed in Section LABEL:A-sec:definition-based-association-features in the supplementary notes, resemble the Wikipedia-based features except that the information source is the definition sentences automatically acquired from our 600 million web pages using the method of Hashimoto et al
p43
aVWe observed that CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p and CEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s performed poorly and tended to favor event causality candidates whose phrase pairs were highly relevant to each other but described the contrasts of events rather than event causality (e.g., build a slow muscle and build a fast muscle ) probably because their main components are PMI values
p44
aVThe baselines are not complete implementations of Do et al u'\u005cu2019' s method which uses discourse relations identified based on Lin et al
p45
aVTable 9 shows the estimated number of acceptable scenarios generated with 70% precision
p46
aVTable 8 shows the number and precision of the samples
p47
aVOur future scenario generation method creates scenarios by chaining event causalities
p48
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1
p49
aVProposed
p50
aVProposed
p51
aVBelow we describe the semantic relations that we believe are likely to constitute event causality
p52
aVIn preliminary experiments, since our proposed method u'\u005cu2019' s performance degraded when C u'\u005cu2062' s was incorporated, we did not use it in our method
p53
aVThis is important since future scenarios, which are generated by chaining event causality as described below, must be self-contained, unlike Hashimoto et al
p54
aVWe extract the event causality between two events represented by two phrases from single sentences that are dependency parsed
p55
aVFor the development data , we identically collected 11,711 examples among which 1,898 were positive
p56
aVWe developed features that capture the characteristics of likely contexts for Japanese event causality (See Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features in the supplementary notes
p57
aVThe training data were created by the annotators through our preliminary experiments and consists of 112,110 among which 9,657 were positive
p58
aVNoun pairs with this relation can constitute event causality when combined with template pairs like improve A u'\u005cu2192' cultivate B
p59
aV5 5 Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model [ 24 ]
p60
aVWe also require the predicate of the cause phrase to syntactically depend on the effect phrase in the sentence from which the event causality was extracted; we guarantee this by verifying the dependencies of the original sentence
p61
aVFinally, Table 5 shows the performance drop by removing the Wikipedia-, definition-, web-, and CEA-based features
p62
aVIn addition, we invented the \u005cUnderline Excitation relation that is expressed by binary patterns made of excitatory and inhibitory templates (Section 3.1
p63
aVTo make event causality self-contained, we wrote guidelines for manually annotating training/development/test data
p64
aVProposed achieved 70% precision at 13% recall
p65
aVIts average precision is different from that in Table 6 due to the difference in test data described above
p66
aVSuch noun pairs mean event causality by substituting them into template pairs like omit A u'\u005cu2192' get B
p67
aVEach event causality candidate may be given multiple original sentences, since a phrase pair can appear in multiple sentences, in which case it is given more than one SVM score
p68
aVWe implement what we consider likely contexts for event causality as context features
p69
aVWe extracted 557 social problem nouns and used the cause phrases of the event causality candidates that consisted of one of the social problem nouns as the scenario u'\u005cu2019' s beginning event
p70
aVCEA-based features are based on the Cause Effect Association (CEA) measure of Do et al
p71
aV2013b ) u'\u005cu2019' s method, which acquired 185 million entailment pairs with 80% precision from our web corpus and was used for contradiction acquisition [ 14 ]
p72
aVHashimoto et al
p73
aVThey developed an automatic excitation template acquisition method that assigns each template an excitation value in range [ - 1 , 1 ] that is positive if the template is excitatory and negative if it is inhibitory
p74
aVWe hypothesize that two nouns with some particular semantic relations are more likely to constitute event causality
p75
aVProposed is the best and the CEA features slightly contribute to the performance, as Proposed-CEA indicates
p76
aVWe collectively call both excitatory and inhibitory templates excitation templates
p77
aVIn this case, the two event causality pairs tend to be about different topics and constitute an incoherent scenario
p78
aVthe performance degraded (46.27 u'\u005cu2192' 45.86) when we only used the Causation binary patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns compared to Proposed
p79
aVThose patterns were acquired from our web corpus by Kloetzer et al
p80
aVTable 4 shows that
p81
aVWe acquired 335,837 patterns by this method
p82
aVThese three datasets have no overlap in terms of phrase pairs
p83
aVA common argument filter removes a scenario if a joint part consists of two templates that share no argument in our u'\u005cu27e8' argument, template u'\u005cu27e9' database, which is compiled from the syntactic dependency data between arguments and templates extracted from our web corpus
p84
aVNote that, for the diversity of the sampled scenarios, our sampling proceeded as follows i) Randomly sample a beginning event phrase from the generated scenarios ii) Randomly sample an effect phrase for the beginning event phrase from the scenarios iii) Regarding the effect phrase as a cause phrase, randomly sample an effect phrase for it, and repeat (iii) up to the specified number of steps (2 or 3
p85
aVExcitation is a semantic property of templates that classifies them into excitatory , inhibitory , and neutral
p86
aV2012 ) extracted 500,000 event causalities with about 70% precision
p87
aVFor example, a likely context of event causality (underlined) would be
p88
aVOur method exploits these features on top of our base features such as nouns and predicates
p89
aV2012 ) used semantic relations to generalize acquired causality instances that include those that are not obviously related to causality
p90
aVWe evaluated the features of our method by ablation tests
p91
aVThey ranked event causality candidates by C u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1
p92
aVConsequently we conclude that not only semantic relations directly relevant to causality like Causation but also those that seem to lack direct relevance to causality like Material are somewhat effective
p93
aVThe final label was determined by majority vote
p94
aVEven when adding the Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns, the performance was still slightly worse than Proposed
p95
aV2011 ) generated semantic knowledge like causality that is written in no sentence
p96
aVNext we examined whether the semantic relations that do not seem directly relevant to causality like Material are effective
p97
aVTo show that our future scenario generation methods can generate many acceptable scenarios with reasonable precision, we experimentally compared four methods
p98
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p99
aVEach phrase in the event causality must consist of a predicate with an argument position ( template , hereafter) like conduct X and a noun like slash-and-burn agriculture that completes X
p100
aVNote that means can be seen as u'\u005cu201c' causing u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' realizing u'\u005cu201d' the purpose of using the means in this relation, and actually event causality can be obtained by incorporating noun pairs of this relation into template pairs like activate A u'\u005cu2192' conduct B
p101
aVOur method optionally applies the following two filters to scenarios for better precision
p102
aVSee Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-binary-patterns in the supplementary notes for examples of our binary patterns
p103
aVThen we check a noun pair (the nouns of the cause and effect phrases) for each event causality candidate, and give the candidate all the patterns in the database that co-occur with the noun pair
p104
aVFor event causality extraction , clues used by previous methods can roughly be categorized as lexico-syntactic patterns [ 1 , 20 ] , words in context [ 19 ] , associations among words [ 28 , 22 , 8 ] , and predicate semantics [ 12 ]
p105
aVTo this end, we propose a supervised method of extracting such event causality as conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification and use its output to generate future scenarios ( scenarios ), which are chains of causality that have been or might be observed in this world like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification u'\u005cu2192' increase Asian dust (from China) u'\u005cu2192' asthma gets worse
p106
aVThe semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus based on Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008
p107
aVWe simply add an additional argument position to each template in the 43,697 excitation templates to make binary patterns
p108
aVSince Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p performed slightly better when using all of the training data in our preliminary experiments, we used all of it
p109
aVBesides features similar to those described above, we propose semantic relation features 3 3 Radinsky et al
p110
aVThe samples were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who were instructed to regard a sample as acceptable if each event causality that constitutes it is plausible and the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent story
p111
aVFor B3 and B4 , 500 semantic classes were obtained from our web corpus using the method of Kazama and Torisawa ( 2008 )
p112
aVUsing the above features, a classifier 6 6 We used SVM l u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' g u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' t with the polynominal kernel ( d = 2 ), available at http://svmlight.joachims.org classifies each event causality candidate into causality and non-causality
p113
aVThe estimated number is calculated as the product of the recall at 70% precision and the number of acceptable scenarios in all the generated scenarios, which is estimated by the annotated samples
p114
aVOur underlying intuition is the observation that event causality tends to hold between two entities linked by semantic relations which roughly entail that one entity strongly affects the other
p115
aVProposed-CEA is Proposed without the CEA-features and shows their contribution
p116
aVNonetheless, we believe that this comparison is informative since CEA can be seen as the main component; they achieved a F1 of 41.7% for extracting causal event relations, but with only CEA they still achieved 38.6%
p117
aVIn Japanese, since the temporal order between events is usually determined by precedence in a sentence, we require the cause phrase to precede the effect phrase
p118
aVAbout nine man-months were required to prepare the data
p119
aVFirst, we assume that two nouns (e.g., slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification ) that take some specific binary semantic relations (e.g., A causes B ) tend to constitute event causality if combined with two predicates (e.g., conduct and exacerbate
p120
aVWe obtained sentences from 600 million web pages
p121
aVSee Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-future-scenarios in the supplementary notes for examples of the generated scenarios
p122
aVFigure 1 shows their precision-recall curves
p123
aVIts relation to event causality might seem unclear, but a material can be seen as a u'\u005cu201c' cause u'\u005cu201d' of a product
p124
aVAll the feature types are effective and contribute to the performance gain that was about 5% higher than the Base features only
p125
aVFigure 2 shows their precision-recall curves
p126
aVNeither involves chaining and restricts themselves to only one event causality step
p127
aVExcitation is divided into six sub types based on the excitation polarity of the binary patterns, the argument positions, and the existence of causative markers
p128
aVMoreover, for broader coverage, we acquired binary patterns that entail or are entailed by one of the patterns of the above six semantic relations
p129
aVScenarios ( s u'\u005cu2062' c s) generated by chaining causally-compatible phrase pairs are scored by S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c ) , which embodies our assumption that an acceptable scenario consists of plausible event causality pairs
p130
aVFleiss u'\u005cu2019' kappa of their judgments was 0.53 (moderate agreement), which is lower than the kappa for the causality judgment
p131
aV× s 2 where p 1 and p 2 are the two phrases of event causality candidates, and s 1 and s 2 are the absolute excitation values of p 1 u'\u005cu2019' s and p 2 u'\u005cu2019' s templates
p132
aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s web information analysis system provides a what-happens-if QA service, which is based on our scenario generation method
p133
aVOur second assumption is that there are grammatical contexts in which event causality is more likely to appear
p134
aVThe CEA-based features were the most effective, while the Wikipedia-based ones slightly degraded the performance
p135
aVIndeed materials can participate in event causality with the help of such template pairs as A is stolen u'\u005cu2192' B is made as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p136
aVFor such candidates, we give the largest score and keep only one original sentence that corresponds to the largest score
p137
aVThe performance was even worse when using no semantic relation ( u'\u005cu201c' None u'\u005cu201d' in Table 4
p138
aVRemember that excitatory templates like cause X entail that X u'\u005cu2019' s function or effect is activated, but inhibitory templates like lower X entail that it is suppressed (Section 3.1
p139
aVFinal judgment was made by majority vote
p140
aVNote that semantic relations are not restricted to those directly relevant to causality like A causes B but can be those that might seem irrelevant to causality like A is an ingredient for B (e.g., plutonium and atomic bomb as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p141
aVWe removed such phrase pairs except those with the highest C u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e , and 960,561 phrase pairs remained, from which we generated two- or three-step scenarios that consisted of two or three phrase pairs
p142
aV341 (68.20%) were acceptable, and the estimated number of acceptable scenarios at a precision rate of 70% and 80% are 26,700 and 5,200 (See Section LABEL:A-sec:precision-scenario-curve in the supplementary notes
p143
aVWe applied the filters to the sampled scenarios of Proposed , and the results were regarded as the sample scenarios of Proposed+Orig and Proposed+Orig+Comm
p144
aVOther clues include shared arguments [ 28 , 4 , 5 ] , which we ignore since we target event causality about two distinct entities
p145
aVThe last assumption embodied in our association features is that each word of the cause phrase must have a strong association (i.e.,, PMI, for example) with that of the effect phrase as slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification in the above example, as in Do et al
p146
aVAn event causality candidate is given a causality score C u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e , which is the SVM score (distance from the hyperplane) that is normalized to [ 0 , 1 ] by the sigmoid function 1 1 + e - x

aVThe Excitation relation roughly means that A activates B (excitatory) or suppresses it (inhibitory

aVOur experiments also show that we generated 50,000 scenarios with 68% precision, which include conduct terrorist operations u'\u005cu2192' terrorist bombing occurs u'\u005cu2192' cause fatalities and injuries u'\u005cu2192' cause economic losses and the above u'\u005cu201c' slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu201d' scenario (Section 5.2
