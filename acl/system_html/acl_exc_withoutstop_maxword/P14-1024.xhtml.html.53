<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Supersenses are particularly attractive features for metaphor detection coarse sense taxonomies can be viewed as semantic concepts, and since concept mapping is a process in which metaphors are born, we expect different supersense co-occurrences in metaphoric and literal combinations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We cannot compare directly our model with this work because our classifier is restricted to detection of only SVO and AN metaphors</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>1) we develop a new state-of-the-art English metaphor detection system that uses conceptual semantic features, such as a degree of abstractness and semantic supersenses; 2 2 https://github.com/ytsvetko/metaphor (2) we create new metaphor-annotated corpora for Russian and English; 3 3 http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ytsvetko/metaphor/datasets.zip (3) using a paradigm of model transfer [ 21 , 41 , 15 ] , we provide support for the hypothesis that metaphors are conceptual (rather than lexical) in nature by showing that our English-trained model can detect metaphors in Spanish, Farsi, and Russian</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>English adjectives do not, as yet, have a similar high-level semantic partitioning in WordNet, thus we use a 13-class taxonomy of adjective supersenses constructed</a>
