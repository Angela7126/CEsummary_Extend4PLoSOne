<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising autoencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Consequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing [ 25 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Moon and Baldridge ( 2007 ) tackle the challenging problem of tagging Middle English, using techniques for projecting syntactic annotations across languages</a>
