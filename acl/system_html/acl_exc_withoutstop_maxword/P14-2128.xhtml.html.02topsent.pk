VTo show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology the open source MSTParser 1 1 We trained a second order labelled parser with all the configurations set to the default value
p1
aVBy inspecting the parser outputs, we found that error propagation caused by assigning incorrect head to punctuations is one of the main reason that leads to this result
p2
aVParsing accuracy is evaluated using unlabelled attachment score (UAS), which is the percentage of words that are assigned the correct lexical heads
