<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because the weight tensors learned by T-MIRA are highly structured, which significantly reduces model/training complexity and makes the learning process very effective in a low-resource environment, but as the amount of data increases, the more complex and expressive vector-based models adapt to the data better, whereas further improvements from the tensor model is impeded by its structural constraints, making it insensitive to the increase of training data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In general, if V features are defined for a learning problem, and we (i) organize the feature set as a tensor u'\ud835' u'\udebd' u'\u2208' u'\u211d' n 1 n 2 u'\u2026' u'\u2062' n D and (ii) use H component rank-1 tensors to approximate the corresponding target weight tensor</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u201c' design freedom u'\u201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This also makes training the model parameters a challenging problem, since the amount of labeled training data is usually small compared to the size of feature sets the feature weights cannot be</a>
