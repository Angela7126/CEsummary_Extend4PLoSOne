<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Compared to our final Convote dataset, an even larger percentage of the ibc sentences exhibit no noticeable political bias</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In particular, the phrase annotations allow our best model to detect bias accurately in complex sentences that the baseline models cannot handle</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our final balanced ibc dataset consists of 3,412 sentences (4,062 before balancing and removing neutral sentences) with a total of 13,640 annotated nodes</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, some information is lost at every propagation step, so rnn s are able to model the shorter sentences in Convote more effectively than the longer ibc sentences</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We had workers annotate 7,000 randomly selected paths from the filtered ibc dataset, with half of the paths coming from conservative authors</a>
