<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To demonstrate, we list the 5 most activated contexts for our example words with Deps embeddings in Table 2</a>
