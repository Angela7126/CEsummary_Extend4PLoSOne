V2) Filter out the structures from which it was almost impossible to derive candidate pre-ordering rules because x or y was an u'\u005cu201c' irrespective u'\u005cu201d' dependency relation, for example, root, conj, cc and so on
p1
aVBy applying our rules and Wang et al u'\u005cu2019' s rules, one can use both dependency and constituency parsers for pre-ordering in Chinese-English PBSMT
p2
aVIf the reordering produced a Chinese phrase that had a closer word order to that of the English one, this structure would be a candidate pre-ordering rule
p3
aVFurther, we define X and Y as the corresponding dependency structures of the dependency relations x and y , respectively
p4
aVTherefore, we applied a rule plmod lobj (localizer object) to reposition the dependent word of the plmod relation (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' Ââç u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 2) to the position before the lobj structure
