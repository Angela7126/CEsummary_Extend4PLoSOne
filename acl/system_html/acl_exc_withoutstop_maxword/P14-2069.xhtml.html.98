<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus far, most lexicon construction approaches focus on constructing general-purpose emotion lexicons [ 11 , 7 , 16 , 4 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For each emotion category, we evaluates it as a binary classification problem</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Hence, the topics consequently group semantically related words into a same emotion category</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since there is no metric explicitly measuring the quality of an emotion lexicon, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in two ways</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>These domain-specific words are mostly not included in any other existing general-purpose emotion lexicons</a>
