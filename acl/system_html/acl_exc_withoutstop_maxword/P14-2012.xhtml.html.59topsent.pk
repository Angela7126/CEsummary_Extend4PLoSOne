VHowever, in domain cts, the improvement that word embeddings provide for word clusters is modest
p1
aVRow 4 shows that word embedding itself is also very useful for domain adaptation in RE since it improves the baseline system for all the target domains
p2
aVWe evaluate word cluster and embedding (denoted by ED) features by adding them individually as well as simultaneously into the baseline feature set
