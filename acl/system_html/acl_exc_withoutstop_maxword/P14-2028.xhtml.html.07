<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the u'\u201d' hard u'\u201d' dataset the performance of the noisy channel and the iterative methods is inferior to our proposed method, see Figure 1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While choosing arg u'\u2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling</a>
