<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We define the sentence compression task as given a sentence composed of n words, u'\ud835' u'\udc31' = x 1 , u'\u2026' , x n , and a length L u'\u2264' n , we need to remove ( n - L ) words from u'\ud835' u'\udc31' , so that the sum of the weights of the dependency tree and word bigrams of the remaining part is maximized</a>
