<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>All the systems show degraded nearest neighbor quality as target words grow rare, but at lower ranks, the u'\u0391' = .04 nearest neighbor system fares considerably better than the symmetric u'\u0391' = .50 system; the line across the bottom tracks the score of a system with randomly generated nearest neighbors</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Below we show that an asymmetric measure, using u'\u0391' and u'\u0392' biased in favor of the less frequent word, greatly improves the performance of a dependency-based vector model in capturing human similarity judgments</a>
