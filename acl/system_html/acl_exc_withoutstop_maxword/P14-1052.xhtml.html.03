<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The u'\u201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we study the restricted NLG problem given a grammar, lexicon, world and a communicative goal, output a valid English sentence that satisfies this goal</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Many such NLG-as-planning systems use a pipeline architecture, working from their communicative goal through discourse planning and sentence generation</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>STRUCT takes three inputs in order to generate a single sentence</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We describe the inputs to STRUCT, followed by the underlying MDP formalism and the probabilistic planning algorithm we use to generate sentences in this MDP</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Following prior work [ 11 ] , we consider a series of sentence generation problems which require the planner to generate a sentence like u'\u201c' The Adj 1 Adj 2 u'\u2026' Adj k dog chased the cat u'\u201d' , where the string of adjectives is a string that distinguishes one dog (whose</a>
