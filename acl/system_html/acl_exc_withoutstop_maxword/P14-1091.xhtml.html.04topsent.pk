V1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way; and (3) We use domain independent feature set which allowing us to use a relatively small number of question-answer pairs to tune model parameters

aVLike MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions

aVIn order to figure out the impacts of question patterns and relation expressions, another experiment (Table 4) is designed to evaluate their independent influences, where u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcac' u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcab' o u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' y and u'\u005cu211b' u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2130' o u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' y denote the results of KB-QA systems which only allow question patterns and relation expressions in question translation respectively
