<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Recall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar, what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, negative features u'\u2014' features that are not observed in any tree u'\u2014' are still powerful indicators of (un)grammaticality if we have never seen a PRN that starts with u'\u201c' has, u'\u201d' or a span that begins with a quotation mark and ends with a close bracket, then we would like the model to be able to place negative weights on these features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our span features appear to work well on both head-initial and head-final languages (see Basque and Korean in the table), and the fact that our parser performs well on such morphologically-rich languages as Hungarian indicates that our suffix model is sufficient to capture most of the morphological effects relevant to parsing</a>
