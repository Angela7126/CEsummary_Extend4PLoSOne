<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With the quantification of semantic similarity provided by the distributional semantic model, it is also possible to properly test the hypothesis that productivity is tied to the structure of the semantic space</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One of the advantages conferred by the quantification of semantic similarity is that lexical items can be precisely considered in relation to each other, and by aggregating the similarity information for all items in the distribution, we can produce a visual representation of the structure of the semantic domain of the construction in order to observe how verbs in that domain are related to each other, and to immediately identify the regions of the semantic space that are densely populated (with tight clusters of verbs), and those that are more sparsely populated (fewer and/or more scattered verbs</a>
