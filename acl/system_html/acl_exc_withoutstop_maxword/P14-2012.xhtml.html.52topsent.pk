VExploiting the shared interest in generalization performance with traditional machine learning, in domain adaptation for RE, we would prefer the relation extractor that fits the source domain data, but also circumvents the overfitting problem over this source domain 1 1 domain overfitting [ Jiang and Zhai2007b ] so that it could generalize well on new domains
