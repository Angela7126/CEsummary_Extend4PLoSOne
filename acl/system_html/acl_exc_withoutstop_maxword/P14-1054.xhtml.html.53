<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In consideration of the Chinese characteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, the Chinese relation extraction is more difficult</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A feature is employed as a singleton feature when it is used without combining with any information</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Only Omni-word feature is bin sensitive</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be generated</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Entity types and subtypes are employed as semantic pair</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Because features may interact mutually in an indirect way, even with the same feature set, different constraint conditions can have significant influences on the final performance</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The entity type and subtype , head noun , position feature are referred to as u'\u2131' t u'\u2062' h u'\u2062' p 8 8 u'\u201c' thp u'\u201d' is an acronym of u'\u201c' t</a>
