<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After applying such a transform to a treebank, we can induce grammars and modify parsing to search as needed to recover just these constituents</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our task is to learn which words can begin ( B ) a hedge constituent</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is possible to parse with a standardly induced PCFG using this sort of hedge constrained parsing that only considers a subset of the chart cells, and speedups are achieved, however this is clearly non-optimal, since the model is ill-suited to combining hedges into flat structures at the root of the tree</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Space constraints preclude inclusion of trials with this method, but the net result is a severe degradation in accuracy (tens of points of F-measure) versus standard parsing</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This property enables us to chunk the sentence into segments that correspond to complete hedges, and parse the segments independently (and simultaneously) instead of parsing the entire sentence</a>
