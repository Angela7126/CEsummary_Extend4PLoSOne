<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We treat citation polarity classification as a sentiment analysis domain adaptation task and therefore must be careful not to define features that are too domain specific</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using a larger training set, along with mSDA, which makes use of the unlabeled data, leads to the best results for citation classification</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The black horizontal line indicates the F 1 score for in-domain citation classification, which sometimes represents the goal for domain adaptation</a>
