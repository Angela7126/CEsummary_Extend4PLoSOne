VThe goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints
p1
aVWe test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony []
p2
aVIf constraints u'\u005cu2019' weights are close together, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate u'\u005cu2019' s probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation
p3
aVThus the log-probability of output \u005ctextipa EtE is 1/8 that of \u005ctextipa ete, and the log-probability of disharmonious \u005ctextipa Ete and \u005ctextipa etE are each 1/24 that of \u005ctextipa ete

aVThe IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w
