<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>CoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The extension of CoSimRank to similarity across graphs is important for the application of bilingual lexicon extraction given a set of correspondences between nodes in two graphs A and B (corresponding to two different languages), a pair of nodes ( a u'\u2208' A , b u'\u2208' B ) is a good candidate for a translation pair if their node similarity is high</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, we have reduced SimRank</a>
