<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Because of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article u'\u201c' Nero u'\u201d' and the corresponding Chinese article is low</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We regard the appearance of the English title in the first sentence of a Baidu Baike article as a binary feature</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the number of all possible words is too large, we adopt a topic model to gather the words into some latent topics</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Each topic is represented by a distribution of words, and each word has a probability score used to measure its contribution to the topic</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because title similarity of the articles is a widely used method, we choose English and Chinese title similarity as the baseline</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>[ 6 ] Thus, the distribution of terms is good measurement of article similarity</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The similarity values generated by title matching and title similarity are used directly as real value features in the SVM model</a>
