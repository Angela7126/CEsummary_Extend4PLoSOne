<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality degradation associated with discourse phenomena as it does not capture problems arising from connective ambiguity on the source side</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit expression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e.,, if the source segment is translated into one or multiple sentences in English, since discourse relations between adjacent sentences are more often implicit (than intra-sentence ones</a>
