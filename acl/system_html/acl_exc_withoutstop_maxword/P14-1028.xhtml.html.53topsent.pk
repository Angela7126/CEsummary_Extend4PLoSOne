VIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation

aVwhere f u'\u005cu0398' ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] ) indicates the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters u'\u005cu0398' = ( M , A , W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2

aVTo model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u005cu2208' T to tag j u'\u005cu2208' T
