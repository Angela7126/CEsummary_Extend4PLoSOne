<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We train two CNN semantic models from sets of pattern u'\u2013' relation and mention u'\u2013' entity pairs, respectively</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We adapt the work of [ 8 , 15 ] for measuring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core component of our semantic parsing approach</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To determine the probabilities of such mappings, we propose using a semantic similarity model based on convolutional neural networks, which is the technical focus in this paper</a>
