VTo select a parent for a mention x of type t = x e t , a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and u'\u005cu2662' is selected with probability proportional to u'\u005cu0391' t 0
p1
aVThe entire corpus, including these entities, is generated according to standard topic model assumptions; we first generate a topic distribution for a document, then sample topics and words for the document [ ]
p2
aVThe tuned model then produced a mention clustering on the full political blog corpus
p3
aVThus, for fixed values of the non-mention tokens and their topics, the probability of generating the mention sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the choices
