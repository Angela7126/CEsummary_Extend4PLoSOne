VOnce 1-many segments are identified, source-side text simplification techniques may be developed [ 17 ] to improve translation quality
p1
aVFor this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many
p2
aVSo before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length
p3
aVTo investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes a source sentence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence
p4
aVWe find however that no strong relationship exists between the two, as shown by the correlation coefficients between HTER values and the number of words in each segment in Table 1
p5
aVThis analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality
