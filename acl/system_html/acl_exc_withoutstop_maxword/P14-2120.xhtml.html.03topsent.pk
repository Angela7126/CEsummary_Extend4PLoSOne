VTwo terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure
p1
aVConsequently, we define the task of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships, with illustrating examples in Table 1 , as follows
p2
aVGiven a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure
p3
aVFor example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u005cu201c' derailment of train u'\u005cu201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u005cu201c' crash of train u'\u005cu201d'
p4
aVThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p5
aVAnother case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI
p6
aVOn the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well
p7
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p8
aVWhile they are not connected syntactically, each of them often has an explicit relationships with other terms in the text, that might support the sought (implied) relationship between a and p
p9
aVThe Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in
