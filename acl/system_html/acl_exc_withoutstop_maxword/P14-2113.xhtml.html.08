<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>AAWD consists of 221 English Wikipedia discussions with positive and negative alignment annotations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e., very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the dispute / non-dispute label for the discussion as a whole</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Discussion Features</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Annotators either label each sentence as positive, negative or neutral, or label the full turn</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The labels in u'\ud835' u'\udcaa' represent very negative (NN), negative (N), neutral (O), positive (P), and very positive (PP), respectively</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We evaluate the systems using standard F1 on classes of positive, negative, and neutral, where samples predicted as PP and P are positive alignment, and samples tagged as NN and N are negative alignment</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We train the sentiment classifier using the Authority and Alignment in Wikipedia Discussions (AAWD) corpus [ 1 ] on</a>
