<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging due to players frequently performing the same action, e.g.,, saving most humans or collecting most pictures which generates a larger number of annotations for items in N than are produced by crowdsourcing</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These mechanics ensure the game naturally produces better quality annotations; in contrast, common crowdsourcing platforms do not support analogous mechanics for enforcing this type of correctness at annotation time</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In contrast, concept-concept associations require more background knowledge to determine if a relation exists; furthermore, Infection gives players limited time to decide (due to board length) and also contains cognitive distractors (zombies</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Scoring is based on both the number of zombies killed and the percentage of uninfected humans saved, motivating players to kill infected humans in order to increase their score</a>
