VFinally, for the Mechanical Turk annotation study, we selected 500 random edit-turn-pairs from ETP-all excluding ETP-unconfirmed
p1
aVHowever, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual edit
p2
aVAssuming that most edit-turn-pairs are non-corresponding, we expect a heavy imbalance in the class distribution
p3
aVAs baseline, we defined a majority class classifier, which labels all edit-turn-pairs as non-corresponding
p4
aVSome of the false positives (i.e., non-corresponding pairs classified as corresponding) were caused by pairs where the revision (as judged by its comment or the edit context) is related to the turn text, however the specific edit in this pair is not
p5
aVTo assess the reliability of these annotations, one of the co-authors manually annotated a random subset of 100 edit-turn-pairs contained in ETP-gold as corresponding or non-corresponding
p6
aVWe refer to this 262 edit-turn-pairs as ETP-unconfirmed
p7
aVThe search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article u'\u005cu2019' s discussion page
p8
aVWe therefore expect to cover the vast majority of corresponding edit-turn-pairs within a search space of 24 hours
p9
aVThe inter-rater agreement between ETP-gold (majority votes over Mechanical Turk annotations) and our expert annotations on this subset is Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu039a' = .72
p10
aVIt was important to find a reasonable amount of corresponding edit-turn-pairs before the actual annotation could take place, as we needed a certain amount of positive seeds to keep turkers from simply labeling pairs as non-corresponding all the time
p11
aVDue to the high class imbalance in the data, the majority class baseline sets a challenging accuracy score of .80
p12
aVAn edit-turn-pair is defined as a pair of an edit from a Wikipedia article u'\u005cu2019' s revision history and a turn from the discussion page bound to the same article
p13
aVThe result is a set of 13,331 edit-turn-pairs, referred to as ETP-all
p14
aVHowever, given the high price for a new corresponding edit-turn-pair (due to the high class imbalance in random data), we consider it as a useful starting point for research on edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia
p15
aVFrom ETP-all, a set of 262 edit-turn-pairs have been annotated as corresponding as part of a preliminary annotation study with one human annotator
p16
aVWe treat the automatic classification of edit-turn-pairs as a binary classification problem
p17
aVWe propose a number of features which are purely based on the textual similarity between the text of the turn, and the edited text and context
p18
aVThe context of an edit is defined as one preceding and one following paragraph of the edited paragraph
p19
aVIf an article has no discussion page, there are no edit-turn-pairs for this article
p20
aVTo keep the class imbalance within reasonable margins, we limited the time span between edits and turns to 86,000 seconds (about 24 hours
p21
aVPrevious work [ 11 , 4 ] has shown that these algorithms work well for edit and turn classification
p22
aVFurthermore, we deleted 21 pairs for which the turn segmentation algorithm clearly failed (e.g., when the turn text was empty
p23
aVThis step is intended to make sure that we have a substantial number of corresponding pairs in the data for the final annotation study
p24
aVTo select good turkers and to block spammers, we carried out a pilot study on a small portion of manually confirmed corresponding and non-corresponding pairs, and required turkers to pass a qualification test
p25
aVTo understand the mistakes of the classifier, we manually assessed error patterns within the model of the Random Forest classifier
p26
aVSeveral of our features are based on metadata from both the edit and the turn
p27
aVRoughly five hours after that turn was issued on the discussion page, user Sbharris added a wikilink to the u'\u005cu201c' History and etymology u'\u005cu201d' section of the article by performing the following edit
p28
aVIndividual turns are retrieved from topics by considering the revision history of the discussion page
p29
aVIn our 24 hours search space, the probability to find a corresponding edit-turn-pair drops steeply for time spans of more than 6 hours
p30
aVSome features are based on the edit or the turn alone and do not take into account the pair itself
p31
aVThe 1,000 most frequent uni-, bi- and trigrams from the turn text are represented as binary features
p32
aVThe low F1 on corresponding pairs is likely due to the small number of training examples
p33
aVBased on an automatic classification using the model presented in our previous work [ 7 ] , we excluded edits classified as Vandalism, Revert or Other
p34
aVEdits are coherent modifications based on a pair of adjacent revisions from Wikipedia article pages
p35
aVWe counted an edit-turn-pair as corresponding, if it was annotated as u'\u005cu201c' corresponding u'\u005cu201d' by least three out of five annotators, and likewise for non-corresponding pairs
p36
aVA reduction of the feature set as judged by a u'\u005cu03a7' 2 ranker improved the results for both Random Forest as well as the SVM, so we limited our feature set to the 100 best features
p37
aVWe therefore define an edit-turn-pair as corresponding, if i) The turn is an explicit suggestion, recommendation or request and the edit performs this suggestion, recommendation or request, ii) the turn is an explicit reference or pointer and the edit adds or modifies this reference or pointer, iii) the turn is a commitment to an action in the future and the edit performs this action, and iv) the turn is a report of a performed action and the edit performs this action
p38
aVDue to their performative nature, we assume that these dialog acts make the turn they belong to a good candidate for a corresponding edit-turn-pair
p39
aVGiven the small size of ETP-gold, we did not assign a fixed train/test split to the data
p40
aVFurthermore, we removed all edits which are part of a revision created by bots, based on the Wikimedia user group 2 2 http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_classes scheme
p41
aVFor the same reason, we did not further divide the data into train/test and development data
p42
aVIn the present study, we have analyzed cases where explicit coordination lead to implicit coordination and vice versa
p43
aVThis was calculated as 1 N u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2211' i = 1 N u'\u005cu2211' c = 1 C v i c C , where N = 750 is the overall number of annotated edit-turn-pairs, C = R 2 - R 2 is the number of pairwise comparisons, R = 5 is the number of raters per edit-turn-pair, and v i c = 1 if a pair of raters c labeled edit-turn-pair i equally, and 0 otherwise
p44
aVEach edit-turn-pair could be labeled as u'\u005cu201c' corresponding u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' non-corresponding u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' can u'\u005cu2019' t tell u'\u005cu201d'
p45
aVWikipedia, as one of the most prominent collaboratively created resources, offers its users a platform to coordinate their writing, the so called talk or discussion pages [ 18 ]
p46
aVBoth of these may be part of a corresponding edit-turn-pair, according to our definition in Section 2
p47
aVMost of the resources used for collaborative writing do not explicitly allow their users to interact directly, so that the implicit effort of coordination behind the actual writing is not documented
p48
aV{mdframed} [backgroundcolor=gray!30, linewidth=0pt, leftmargin=0, rightmargin=0, skipabove=4pt, skipbelow=3pt, innertopmargin=3pt, innerbottommargin=3pt] '' borax '' u'\u005cu2192' [[borax]] This is what we define as a corresponding edit-turn-pair
p49
aVMore details follow in Section 2
p50
aVThe turkers were presented the turn text, the turn topic name, the edit in its context, and the edit comment (if present
p51
aVSimilarity has been calculated between i) the plain edit text and the turn text, ii) the edit and turn text after any wiki markup has been removed, iii) the plain edit context and turn text, and iv) the edit context and turn text after any wiki markup has been removed
p52
aVFrom ETP-unconfirmed, we selected 250 random edit-turn-pairs
p53
aVThis partially explains the high number of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs and the consequent class imbalance
p54
aVThe turn text includes the entire text from the turn
p55
aVFor each edit, we stored both the edited paragraph and its context from the old revision as well as the edited paragraph and context from the new revision
p56
aVAmong these, we expect to find mostly non-corresponding pairs
p57
aVWe recorded whether the name of the edit user and the turn user are equal, the absolute time difference between the turn and the edit, and whether the edit occurred before the turn
p58
aVWith the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk 1 1 www.mturk.com , we crowdsourced annotations on a corpus of edit-turn-pairs from 26 random English Wikipedia articles in various thematic categories
p59
aVCosine similarity, longest common subsequence, and word n-gram similarity were also applied to measure the similarity between the edit comment and the turn text as well as the similarity between the edit comment and the turn topic name
p60
aVThe edit context includes the edited paragraph and one preceding and one following paragraph
p61
aVKaltenbrunner and Laniado ( 2012 ) analyze the development of discussion pages in Wikipedia with respect to time and compare dependences between edit peaks in the revision history of the article itself and the respective discussion page
p62
aVFirst, we want to understand the nature of correspondence between Wikipedia article edits and discussion page turns
p63
aVWe define all edit-turn-pairs which do not conform to the upper classification as non-corresponding
p64
aVWe used Apache OpenNLP 4 4 http://opennlp.apache.org for the segmentation of edit and turn text
p65
aVTo deal with the class imbalance problem, we applied cost-sensitive classification
p66
aVA definition of correspondence is not straightforward in the context of edit-turn-pairs
p67
aVFurthermore, we measured the length of the edit text and the length of the turn text
p68
aVWe used DKPro TC [ 5 ] to carry out the machine learning experiments on edit-turn-pairs
p69
aVAmong the false negatives, we found errors caused by a missing direct textual overlap between edit and turn text
p70
aVIn correspondence with the distribution of class sizes in the training data, the cost for false negatives was set to 4, and for false positives to 1
p71
aVTurns are segments from Wikipedia discussion pages
p72
aVIn these cases, the correspondence was indicated only (if at all) by some relationship between turn text and edit comment
p73
aVWe refer to this dataset as ETP-gold
p74
aVTheir study shows that both implicit coordination (on the article itself) and explicit coordination (on the discussion page of the article) play important roles for the improvement of article quality
p75
aVThe edit text is composed of any inserted, deleted or relocated text from both the old and the new revision
p76
aVTraining and testing the classifier has been carried out with the help of the Weka Data Mining Software [ 12 ]
p77
aVIn addition to that, Wikipedia stores all edits made to any of its pages in a revision history, which makes the actual writing process explicit
p78
aVThe resulting 750 pairs have each been annotated by five turkers
p79
aVEach pair of adjacent revisions found in the edit history of an article consists of one or more edits, which describe either inserted, deleted, changed or relocated text
p80
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs in the English Wikipedia fully automatically
p81
aVIn the following, we explain the step-by-step approach we chose to create a suitable corpus for the annotation study
p82
aVTo capture a fine-grained picture of changes to Wikipedia article pages, we rely on the notion of edits defined in our previous work [ 6 ]
p83
aVWhile there are several studies which analyze the high-level relationship between discussion and edit activity in Wikipedia articles, very few have investigated the correspondence between edits and turns on the textual level
p84
aVThe average pairwise percentage agreement over all pairs is 0.66
p85
aVTo enable such interaction, we extract segments from discussion pages, called turns, and connect them to corresponding edits in the respective article
p86
aVFirst, an automatic detection of corresponding edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia pages might help users of the encyclopedia to better understand the development of the article they are reading
p87
aVThis resulted in 128 corresponding and 508 non-corresponsing pairs, or 636 pairs in total
p88
aVAs shown in Figure 1 , more than 50% of all corresponding edit-turn-pairs in ETP-gold occur within a time span of less than one hour
p89
aVConsider the following snippet from the discussion page of the article u'\u005cu201c' Boron u'\u005cu201d' in the English Wikipedia
p90
aVEdits are associated with metadata from the revision they belong to, this includes the comment (if present), the user name and the time stamp
p91
aV2012 ) suggest four types of explicit performatives in their annotation scheme for dialog acts of Wikipedia turns
p92
aVTo rule out ambiguous cases, we created the Gold Standard corpus with the help of majority voting
p93
aVAlong with each turn, we store the name of its user, the time stamp, and the name of the topic to which the turn belongs
p94
aVTo segment discussion pages into turns, we follow a procedure proposed by Ferschke et al
p95
aVWe consider this agreement high enough to draw conclusions from the annotations [ 2 ]
p96
aVWe make ETP-gold freely available
p97
aVKittur and Kraut ( 2008 ) analyze correspondence between article quality and activity on the discussion page
p98
aVDiscussion pages are then segmented into topics based upon the structure of the page
p99
aVWe used the Sweble parser [ 8 ] to remove Wiki markup
p100
aVA subsequent study [ 17 ] adds more dimensions, among these an explicit category for references to article edits
p101
aV2007 ) propose 11 dimensions to classify discussion page turns
p102
aV2012 ) which is the basis for our turn segmentation, there are several studies dedicated to discourse structure in Wikipedia
p103
aVFurthermore, they observed that the edit peaks in articles and their discussion pages are mostly independent
p104
aVThey find that the development of a discussion page is often bound to the topic of the article, i.e., articles on time-specific topics such as events grow much faster than discussions about timeless, encyclopedic content
p105
aVSecond, we want to know the distinctive properties of corresponding edit-turn-pairs and how to use these to automatically detect corresponding pairs
p106
aVThe moderate pairwise agreement reflects the complexity of this task for non-experts
p107
aVThe authors would like to give special thanks to Viswanathan Arunachalam and Dat Quoc Nguyen, who carried out initial experiments and the preliminary annotation study, and to Emily Jamison, who set up the Mechanical Turk task
p108
aVThis procedure successfully segmented 94 % of all turns in a corpus from the Simple English Wikipedia [ 11 ]
p109
aVObviously, this is a fairly small dataset which does not cover a representative sample of articles from the English Wikpedia
p110
aVThe detection of correspondence between edits and turns is also relevant beyond Wikipedia
p111
aVIn a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, we tested a Random Forest classifier [ 3 ] and an SVM [ 16 ] with polynomial kernel
p112
aVThis might happen, when somebody corrects a spelling error in a paragraph that is heavily disputed on the discussion page
p113
aVWe applied various filters to avoid annotating trivial content
p114
aVOn February 16th of 2011, user JCM83 added the turn
p115
aVTo calculate edits, a line-based diff comparison between the old revision and the new revision is made, followed by several post-processing steps
p116
aVFurthermore, we will explain the kind of correspondence between edits and turns we are interested in
p117
aVIn this section, we will define the basic units of our task, namely edits and turns
p118
aVInstead of having to read through all of the discussion page which can be an exhausting task for many of the larger articles in the English Wikipedia, users could focus on those discussions that actually had an impact on the article they are reading
p119
aVWith the help of the Java Wikipedia Library [ 19 ] , we access discussion pages from a database
p120
aVSecond, assuming that edits often introduce new knowledge to an article, it might be interesting to analyze how much of this knowledge was actually generated within the discourse on the discussion page
p121
aVBesides the work by Ferschke et al
p122
aVIn the following, we list the features extracted from preprocessed edits and turns
p123
aVwidth= {axis} [ ylabel=% of pairs, xlabel= time span in hours, axis x line*=none, axis y line*=left, tick align=outside, ymajorgrids, legend style=at=(0.55,0.95),anchor=north,legend columns=6, height=30mm, bar width=2mm, xticklabels= u'\u005cu2264' 1, 2-6, 7-11, 12-16, 17-21, xtick=1, u'\u005cu2026' ,5, ymin=0, ymax=60, ybar ] \u005caddplot [smooth, ybar, fill=lightgray, mark=none, draw=black] coordinates (1, 51) (2, 31) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) ; \u005caddlegendentry corresponding
p124
aVIn particular, they find a correlation between the article edits and their discussions around the anniversaries of the events
p125
aVThe process of user interaction in collaborative writing has been the topic of many studies in recent years [ 9 ]
p126
aVThe classification results for the above configuration are displayed in Table 1
p127
aVFerschke et al
p128
aVWe recorded whether the edit is an insertion, deletion, modification or relocation
p129
aVRather, hyperparameters were optimized using grid-search over multiple cross-validation experiments, aiming to maximize accuracy
p130
aVWith an overall macro-averaged F1 of .79, Random Forest yielded the best results, both with respect to precision as well as recall
p131
aVCosine similarity was applied on binary weighted term vectors ( L 2 norm

p134
aVWe used the cosine similarity, longest common subsequence, and word n-gram similarity measures
p135
aVWe argue that linking these two resources helps to get a better picture of the collaborative writing process
p136
aV{mdframed} [backgroundcolor=gray!30, linewidth=0pt, leftmargin=0, rightmargin=0, skipabove=4pt, skipbelow=3pt, innertopmargin=3pt, innerbottommargin=3pt] Shouldn u'\u005cu2019' t borax be wikilinked in the u'\u005cu201c' etymology u'\u005cu201d' paragraph
p137
aVThe most frequent dimensions in their sample are requests for coordination and requests for information
p138
aVThe word n-gram measure [ 15 ] calculates a Jaccard similarity coefficient on trigrams
p139
aVThis dimension accounts for roughly 5 to 10% of all turns
p140
aVBoth classifiers performed significantly better than the baseline (non-overlapping confidence intervals, see Table 1
