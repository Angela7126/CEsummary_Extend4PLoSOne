VWork on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration
p1
aVIn summary, we are given a segmented lattice, which encodes the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s translation space as an acceptor over morphemes
p2
aVDoing so enables the inclusion of an unsegmented target language model, and with a small amount of bookkeeping, it also allows the inclusion of features related to the operations performed during desegmentation (see Section 3.4
p3
aVOur goal is to desegment the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s output lattice, and in doing so, gain access to a compact, desegmented view of a large portion of the translation search space
p4
aVAs in Finnish, the 1-best desegmentation using Morfessor did not surpass the unsegmented baseline, producing a test BLEU of only 31.4 (not shown in Table 1
p5
aVWe compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice
p6
aVMost techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model
p7
aVWe approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the
