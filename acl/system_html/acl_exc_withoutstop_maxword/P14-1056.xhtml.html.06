<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For example, when booktitle segments co-occur with number segments but not with journal segments, the second constraint is violated</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Some examples of constraints in this form enforce that journal segments should co-occur with pages segments and that booktitle segments should co-occur with address segments</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Take, for example, the constraint that the number of number segments does not exceed the number of booktitle segments, as well as the constraint that it does not exceed the number of journal segments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The two hierarchical constraints with the highest importance scores with non-zero learned penalties constrain the output such that number of person segments does not exceed the number of first segments and vice-versa</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One important pairwise constraint penalizes outputs in which thesis segments don u'\u2019' t co-occur with school segments</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The only one author constraint is particularly useful for correctly labeling editor segments in cases where unconstrained inference mislabels them as author segments</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MAP inference in the model with soft constraints is performed using Soft-DD, shown in Algorithm 3</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since we truncate penalties at 0, this suggests that we will learn a penalty of 0 for constraints in three categories constraints that do not hold in the ground truth, constraints that hold in the ground truth but are</a>
