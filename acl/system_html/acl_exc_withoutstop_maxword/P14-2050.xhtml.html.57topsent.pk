(lp0
VWe thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity
p1
aVIn this paper we experiment with dependency-based syntactic contexts
p2
aVA very common paradigm for acquiring such representations is based on the distributional hypothesis of Harris [ 16 ] , stating that words in similar contexts have similar meanings
p3
aVSyntactic contexts capture different information than bag-of-word contexts, as we demonstrate using the sentence u'\u005cu201c' Australian scientist discovers star with telescope u'\u005cu201d'
p4
aVThe next two examples demonstrate that similarities induced from Deps share a syntactic function (adjectives and gerunds), while similarities based on BoW are more diverse
p5
aVThe pairs are ranked according to cosine similarities between the embedded words
p6
aVOptimizing this objective makes observed word-context pairs have similar embeddings, while scattering unobserved pairs
p7
aVSince
