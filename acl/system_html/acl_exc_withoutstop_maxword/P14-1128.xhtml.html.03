<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The type-level word boundary distributions, induced by the character-based alignment (VES-NO-GP), and the graph propagation (VES-GP-PL), are regarded as virtual evidences to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on the unlabeled data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One of our main objectives is to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on unlabeled data, under a non-linear GP constraint encoding the bilingual knowledge</a>
