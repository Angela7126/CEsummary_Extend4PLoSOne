<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If we think about how linguistic reference is acquired, a scenario in which a learner first encounters a new object and then seeks its reference in the language of the surrounding environment (e.g.,, adults having a conversation, the text of a book with an illustration of an unknown object) is very natural</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, since not all new concepts in the linguistic environment refer to new objects (they might denote abstract concepts or out-of-scene objects), it seems more reasonable for the learner to be more alerted to linguistic cues about a recently-spotted new object than vice versa</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, once the learner observes a new object, she can easily construct a full visual representation for it (and the acquisition literature has shown that humans are wired for good object segmentation and recognition [ 50 ] ) u'\u2013' the more challenging task is to scan the ongoing and very ambiguous linguistic communication for contexts that might be relevant and informative about the new object</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v u'\u2192' w</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On the contrary, the first time a learner is exposed to a new object, the linguistic information available is likely also very limited</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this section, we aim at simulating a fast mapping scenario in which the learner has been just exposed to a new concept, and thus has limited linguistic evidence for that concept</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Moreover, if this is also the first linguistic encounter of that concept, then we refer to the task as fast mapping</a>
