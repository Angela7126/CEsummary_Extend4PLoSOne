<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A distributional thesaurus is a lexical network that lists semantic neighbours, computed from a corpus and a similarity measure between lexical items, which generally captures the similarity of contexts in which the items occur</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We used this dataset to set up a supervised classification experiment in order to automatically predict the relevance of a semantic link in a given discourse</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The last set of features derive from the occurrences of related tokens in the considered discourses</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A few other contextual features are included in the model the distances between pairs of related items, instantiated as</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Finally, we took into account the network of related lexical items, by considering the largest sets of words present in the text and connected in the database (self-connected components), by adding the following features</a>
