VRecall that LP only takes into account source similarity; since the vast majority of generated candidates do not occur as labeled neighbors u'\u005cu2019' labels, restricting propagation to the source graph drastically reduces the usage of generated candidates as labels, but does not completely eliminate it

aVFurthermore, despite completely un-aligned, non-comparable monolingual text on the Urdu and English sides, and a very large language model, we can still achieve gains in excess of 1.2 BLEU points ( u'\u005cu201c' SLP u'\u005cu201d' ) in a difficult evaluation scenario, which shows that the technique adds a genuine translation improvement over and above naïve memorization of n -gram sequences
