<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Each node of the graph corresponds to a candidate keyphrase from the document and an edge connects two related candidates</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An evaluation error occurs when a system outputs a candidate that is semantically equivalent to a gold keyphrase, but is considered erroneous by a scoring program because of its failure to recognize that the predicted phrase and the corresponding gold keyphrase are semantically equivalent</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Hence, an evaluation error occurs if a system predicts Olympic games but not Olympics as a keyphrase and the scoring program fails to identify them as semantically equivalent</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Another unsupervised approach to keyphrase extraction involves grouping the candidate keyphrases in a document into topics , such that each topic is composed of all and only those candidate keyphrases that are related to that topic [ 13 , 33 , 32 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the Ben Johnson example, many keyphrase extractors fail to identify 100-meter dash and gold medal as keyphrases, resulting in infrequency errors</a>
