<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Third, we note that both video games in the paid setting incur a fixed cost (for the prizes) and therefore additional games played can only further decrease the cost per annotation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These mechanics ensure the game naturally produces better quality annotations; in contrast, common crowdsourcing platforms do not support analogous mechanics for enforcing this type of correctness at annotation time</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations</a>
