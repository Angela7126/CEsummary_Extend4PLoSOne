<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Several other works relied heavily on lexical patterns, which would suffer from deficiency because such patterns can only cover a small proportion of complex linguistic circumstances [ 10 , 23 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The reason is that the inference based on the relations identified automatically may lead to error propagation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We measure the inter-annotator agreement using the kappa coefficient [ 22 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The combination strategy is to simply merge all positive results from the two methods together, and then to infer new relations based on the transitivity of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations and its reverse (hyponym u'\u2013' hypernym) have one-to-one correspondence, their performances are equal</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Following the method for discovering patterns automatically [ 23 ] , McNamee et al</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>2009 ) propose a method based on patterns to find hypernyms on arbitrary noun phrases</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Several other methods are based on lexical patterns</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>2006 ) provides a global optimization</a>
