VIf the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels
p1
aVIf a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1
p2
aVWhile classifying a test document, its probability distribution over class labels is inferred using TS-LDA model and it is classified to its most probable class label
p3
aVIf more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t
p4
aVIf the topic assigned to the word w at the position n in document d is t, then we replace it by the class label assigned to the topic t
p5
aVIn this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words
p6
aVWe name this model as Topic Sprinkled LDA (TS-LDA
p7
aVAs in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator
