<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We associate each sentence with an undirected latent tree graphical model, which is a tree consisting of both observed variables (corresponding to the words in the sentence) and an additional set of latent variables that are unobserved in the data</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u201c' backwards u'\u201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This undirected latent tree is then directed via a direction mapping to give the final constituent parse</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Following this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing states and words for each tag sequence u'\ud835' u'\udc99' as a latent tree graphical model, which encodes conditional</a>
