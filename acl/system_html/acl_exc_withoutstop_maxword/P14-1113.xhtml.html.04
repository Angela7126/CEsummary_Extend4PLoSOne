<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our method based on word embeddings can discover more hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations than the previous methods can</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That is, all word pairs ( x , y ) in the training data are first clustered into several groups, where word pairs in each group are expected to exhibit similar hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then we elaborate on our proposed method composed of three major steps, namely, word embedding training, projection learning, and hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relation identification</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations</a>
