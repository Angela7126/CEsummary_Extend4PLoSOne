VThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p1
aVFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p2
aVFor our skeletal language model, we trained a 5-gram language model on the target-side of the bilingual data by generalizing non-skeleton segments to Xs
p3
aVCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p4
aVWe chose the default feature
