VThe model must learn the markedness constraints * \u005ctextipa I and Harmony , as well as the weights for all four constraints
p1
aVThe goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints
p2
aVIn MaxEnt OT, each constraint has a weight, and the candidates u'\u005cu2019' scores are the sums of the weights of violated constraints
p3
aVIn paradigms where each markedness constraint distinguishes candidates, the learned constraints match the standard constraints
p4
aVIBPOT currently learns extensional constraints, defined by which candidates do or do not violate the constraint
p5
aVWe test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony []
p6
aVUnlike previous OT learning methods, which assume known constraint definitions and only learn the relative strength of these
