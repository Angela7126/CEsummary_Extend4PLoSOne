<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We now evaluate STRUCT u'\u2019' s ability to generate sentences given negated communicative goals</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we compare STRUCT to a state-of-the-art NLG system, CRISP, 1 1 We were unfortunately unable to get the PCRISP system to compile, and so we could not evaluate it and evaluate three hypotheses i) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as it generates increasingly large referring expressions, (ii) STRUCT is comparable in speed and generation quality to CRISP as the size of the grammar which they use increases, and (iii) STRUCT is capable of communicating complex propositions, including multiple concurrent goals, negated goals, and nested subclauses</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the next set of experiments, we illustrate that STRUCT can solve a variety of complex communicative goals such as negated goals, conjuctions and goals requiring nested subclauses to be output</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We first evaluate STRUCT u'\u2019' s ability to accomplish multiple communicative goals when generating a single sentence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Negated Goals</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This demonstrates that STRUCT is balancing these negated communicative goals with its positive goals</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Multiple Goals</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Next, we evaluate STRUCT u'\u2019' s ability to generate sentences with nested subclauses</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Finally, we evaluate STRUCT u'\u2019' s ability to generate sentences including conjunctions</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We then provide STRUCT with multiple goals</a>
