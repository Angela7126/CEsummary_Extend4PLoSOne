<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We can create an infinite mixture model by combining the ddCRP prior with a likelihood function defining the probability of the data given the cluster assignments</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For each evaluation setting we provide two sets of scores u'\u2014' first are the 1-1 and V-m scores for the given model, second are the comparable scores for K-means run with the same number of clusters as induced by the non-parametric model</a>
