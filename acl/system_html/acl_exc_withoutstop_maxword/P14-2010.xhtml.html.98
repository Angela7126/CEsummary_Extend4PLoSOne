<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, in our approach the annotator can assign multiple class labels to a topic, hence our approach is more flexible for the annotator to encode her domain knowledge efficiently</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the annotator assigns a wrong class label to a topic representing multiple classes (e.g., first topic in Table 3), then it may affect the performance of the resulting classifier</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An important limitation of these algorithms is coming up with a small set of words that should be presented to the annotators for labeling</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If a document d belongs to the class c1 then a set of artificial words which represent the class c1 are appended into the document d, otherwise a set of artificial words which represent the class c2 are appended</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We then ask a human annotator to assign one or more class labels to the topics based on their most probable words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t</a>
