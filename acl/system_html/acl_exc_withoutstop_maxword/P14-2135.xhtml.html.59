<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u222a' C introduced in Section 2</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We apply image dispersion-based filtering as follows if both concepts in an evaluation pair have an image dispersion below a given threshold, both the linguistic and the visual representations are included</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On this more diverse sample, which reflects the range of concepts typically found in linguistic corpora, image dispersion is a particularly useful diagnostic for identifying the very abstract or very concrete concepts</a>
