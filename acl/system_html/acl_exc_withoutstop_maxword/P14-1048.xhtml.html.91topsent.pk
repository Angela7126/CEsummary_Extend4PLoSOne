VFirst, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document
p1
aVIn addition to efficiency, our use of a single CRF chain for all constituents can better capture the sequential dependencies among context, by taking into account the information from partially built discourse constituents, rather than bottom-level EDUs only
p2
aVAs shown by Feng and Hirst ( 2012 ) , for a pair of discourse constituents of interest, the sequential information from contextual constituents is crucial for determining structures
p3
aVTherefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u005cu2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs
p4
aVWe have thus showed that the time complexity is linear in n , which is the number of sentences in the document
p5
aVIn this way, we are able to take into account the sequential information from contextual discourse constituents, which cannot be naturally represented in HILDA with SVMs as local classifiers
p6
aVAs a result of successfully avoiding the expensive non-greedy parsing algorithms, our discourse parser is very efficient in practice
p7
aVAfter an intra- or multi-sentential discourse tree is fully built, we perform a post-editing to consider possible modifications to the current tree, by considering useful information from the discourse constituents on upper levels, which is unavailable in the bottom-up tree-building process
