VSubtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root
p1
aVOur method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree
p2
aVAs we can see, subtree selection only selected important subtrees that did not include the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root, e.g.,, purpose-clauses and that-clauses
p3
aVWe counted the number of sentences in the source document that each method used to generate a summary 5 5 Note that the number for the EDU method is not equal to selected textual units because a sentence in the source document may contain multiple EDUs
p4
aVThe sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges
p5
aVThe document tree is a tree that has sentences as nodes and head modifier relationships between sentences obtained by RST as edges
p6
aVFigure 4 has two example sentences for which both methods selected a subtree as part of a summary
p7
aVThe [ u'\u005cu22c5' ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree
p8
aVRooted sentence subtree only selects rooted sentence subtrees 2 2 We achieved this by making R c u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) only return the
