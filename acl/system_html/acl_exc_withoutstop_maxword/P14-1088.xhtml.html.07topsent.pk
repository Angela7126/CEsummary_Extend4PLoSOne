VFinally, we also evaluate the metric on both dependency and phrase structure data
p1
aVIn this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu0391' and tree edit distance
p2
aVThree of the data sets are dependency treebanks (NDT, CDT, PCEDT) and one phrase structure treebank (SSD), and of the dependency treebanks the PCEDT contains semantic dependencies, while the other two have traditional syntactic dependencies
p3
aVHowever, most evaluations of syntactic treebanks use simple accuracy measures such as bracket F 1 scores for constituent trees (NEGRA, [] ; TIGER, [] ; Cat3LB, [] ; The Arabic Treebank, [] ) or labelled or unlabelled attachment scores for dependency syntax (PDT, [] ; PCEDT [] ; Norwegian Dependency Treebank, []
p4
aVThe data studied in this work has previously been used by \u005cciteN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures
p5
aVThe definitive reference for agreement measures in computational linguistics is \u005cciteN Art:Poe08, who argue forcefully in favour of the use of chance-corrected measures of agreement over simple accuracy measures
p6
aVNext, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work
p7
aVThe only work we know of using chance-corrected metrics is \u005cciteN Rag:Dic13, who use MASI [] to measure agreement on dependency relations and head selection in multi-headed dependency syntax, and \u005cciteN Bha:Sha12, who compute Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu039a' [] on dependency relations in single-headed dependency syntax
p8
aVIn our evaluation, we will contrast labelled accuracy, the standard parser evaluation metric, and our three u'\u005cu0391' metrics
p9
aVFor large data sets such as the PCEDT set used in this work, computing u'\u005cu0391' with tree edit distance as the distance measure can take a very long time
p10
aVThis is due to a mismatch between the formulation of the agreement measures, which assumes that the annotations have no or relatively little internal structure, and syntactic annotation where structure is the entire point of the annotation
p11
aVTherefore we will also evaluate our metrics on real-world inter-annotator agreement data sets
p12
aVTree edit distance has previously been used in the TedEval software [] for parser evaluation agnostic to both annotation scheme and theoretical framework, but
