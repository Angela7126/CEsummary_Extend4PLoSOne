VSubtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root
p1
aVThe sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges
p2
aVOur method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree
p3
aVRooted sentence subtree only selects rooted sentence subtrees 2 2 We achieved this by making R c u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) only return the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root node in Figure 7
p4
aVWe can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree
p5
aVWe can set the candidate for the root node of the subtree by using constraint ( 7
p6
aVThe [ u'\u005cu22c5' ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree
p7
aVAs we can see, subtree selection only selected important subtrees that did not include the parser u'\u005cu2019' s root, e.g.,, purpose-clauses and that-clauses
p8
aVFirst, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree
p9
aVConstraints ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are tree constraints for a document tree and sentence
