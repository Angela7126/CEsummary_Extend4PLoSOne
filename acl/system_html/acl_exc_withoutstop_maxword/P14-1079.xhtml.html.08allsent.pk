aVSuppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d -dimensional textual features, and t labels (relations), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al
p6
aVMa et al
p7
aVSnow et al
p8
aVThen, Ma et al
p9
aVInspired by multi-instance learning [ 17 ] , Riedel et al
p10
aVWe have mentioned that the basic alignment assumption of distant supervision [ 19 ] tends to generate noisy (noisy features and incomplete labels) and sparse (sparse features) data
p11
aV[ 22 ] , and also used by Hoffmann et al
p12
aVMore specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels
p13
aVOur models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al
p14
aVIn essence, distantly supervised relation extraction is an incomplete multi-label classification task with sparse and noisy features
p15
aVNoisy features
p16
aVSimilar to noisy features, the generated labels can be incomplete
p17
aVSparse features
p18
aVIncomplete labels
p19
aVThe rationale of this assumption is that noisy features and incomplete labels are semantically correlated
p20
aVFor our relation classification task, both features and labels are binary
p21
aV[ 24 ] proposed a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for relation extraction, which jointly modeled all the sentences in texts and all labels in knowledge bases for a given entity pair
p22
aVWe extract diverse textual features from all those relation mentions and combine them into a rich feature vector labeled by the relation names ( President-of and Born-in ) to produce a weak training corpus for relation classification
p23
aVThree kinds of features, namely, lexical, syntactic and named entity tag features, were extracted from relation mentions
p24
aVIn such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank
p25
aVWe relax the feature filtering threshold ( u'\u005cu0398' = 4 , 3 , 2 ) in Surdeanu et al u'\u005cu2019' s [ 24 ] open source program to generate more sparse features from NYT u'\u005cu2019' 10 dataset
p26
aVThe basic alignment assumption of this work is that if a pair of entities participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these entities are labeled by that relation name
p27
aV[ 19 ] adopted Freebase [ 3 , 2 ] , a large-scale crowdsourcing knowledge base online which contains billions of relation instances and thousands of relation names, to distantly supervise Wikipedia corpus
p28
aVFor example, the second relation mention in Figure 1 does not explicitly describe any relation instance, so features extracted from this sentence can be noisy
p29
aVRelation Extraction (RE) is the process of generating structured relation knowledge from unstructured natural language texts
p30
aVNot all relation mentions express the corresponding relation instances
p31
aVThe first dataset 12 12 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/ , NYT u'\u005cu2019' 10, was developed by Riedel et al
p32
aVDue to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high
p33
aVThe second dataset 13 13 http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/data-univSchema/ , NYT u'\u005cu2019' 13, was also released by Riedel et al
p34
aVOur work is more relevant to Riedel et al u'\u005cu2019' s [ 21 ] which considered the task as a matrix factorization problem
p35
aVThen we can extract a variety of textual features and learn a multi-class logistic regression classifier
p36
aVMoreover, the logistic cost function is integrated in our models to reduce the influence of noisy features and incomplete labels, due to that it is suitable for binary variables
p37
aVThe new framework for classification enhances the robustness to data noise by penalizing different cost functions for features and labels
p38
aVHowever, the incomplete knowledge base does not contain the corresponding relation instance ( Senate-of(Barack Obama, U.S.)
p39
aVTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant supervision
p40
aVAs we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models that can automatically extract relation instances from large-scale online natural language corpora without hand-labeled annotation
p41
aV[ 13 ] pointed out that many entity pairs have more than one relation
p42
aVAs we cannot tell what kinds of features are effective in advance, we have to use NLP toolkits, such as Stanford CoreNLP 10 10 http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtml , to extract a variety of textual features, e.g.,, named entity tags, part-of-speech tags and lexicalized dependency paths
p43
aVMore specifically, NYT u'\u005cu2019' 10 contains much higher dimensional features than NYT u'\u005cu2019' 13, whereas fewer training and testing items
p44
aVThey extended the multi-instance learning framework [ 22 ] to the multi-label circumstance
p45
aV[ 22 ] relaxed the strong assumption and replaced all sentences with at least one sentence
p46
aVThe low-rank factorization of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers the low-dimensional representation of de-correlation for features and labels
p47
aVAn example accounting for the basic but practical assumption is illustrated in Figure 1, in which we know that the two entities ( Barack Obama, U.S are not only involved in the relation instances 8 8 According to convention, we regard a structured triple r u'\u005cu2062' ( e i , e j ) as a relation instance which is composed of a pair of entities e i , e j and a relation name r with respect to them coming from knowledge bases ( President-of(Barack Obama, U.S.) and Born-in(Barack Obama, U.S.) ), but also co-occur in several relation mentions 9 9 The sentences that contain the given entity pair are called relation mentions appearing in free texts ( Barack Obama is the 44th and current President of the U.S and Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S etc
p48
aVFor example, the fourth relation mention in Figure 1 should have been labeled by the relation Senate-of
p49
aVTherefore, the distant supervision paradigm may generate incomplete labeling corpora
p50
aV[ 21 ] , in which they only regarded the lexicalized dependency path between two entities as features
p51
aVUnfortunately, most of them appear only once in the training corpus, and hence leading to very sparse features
p52
aVThe reason is that we suppose the optimal low-rank representation of the matrix Z conveys the truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation between the features and the corresponding labels
p53
aVIn other words, for each approach, the amount of truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation keeps constant for the same dataset, which, to some extent, explains the reason why our approaches are robust to sparse features
p54
aV* via employing the regularization terms, i.e.,, the cost functions C x and C y for features and labels
p55
aVTherefore, we follow their settings and adopt the same way to filter the features
p56
aVHowever, they did not concern about the data noise brought by the basic assumption of distant supervision
p57
aVOther literatures [ 25 , 18 , 27 , 26 ] addressed more specific issues, like how to construct the negative class in learning or how to adopt more information, such as name entity tags, to improve the performance
p58
aVIn practical applications, we also concern about the precision on Top-N predicted relation instances
p59
aV[ 23 ] used WordNet as the knowledge base to discover more hpyernym/hyponym relations between entities from news articles
p60
aVThis paradigm is promising to generate large-scale training corpora automatically
p61
aVMoreover, their programs can control the feature sparsity degree through a threshold u'\u005cu0398' which filters the features that appears less than u'\u005cu0398' times
p62
aVTo address the lacking training data issue, we consider the distant [ 19 ] or weak [ 13 ] supervision paradigm attractive, and we improve the effectiveness of the paradigm in this paper
p63
aV[ 10 ] , which formulated the multi-label transductive learning as a matrix completion problem
p64
aVFinally, we can achieve Top-N predicted relation instances via ranking the values of P r ( r j p i )
p65
aVFigure 6 shows that our approaches consistently outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods with diverse feature sparsity degrees
p66
aVThe idea of distant supervision was firstly proposed in the field of bioinformatics [ 8 ]
p67
aVHowever, as producing hand-labeled corpora is laborius and expensive, the supervised approach can not satisfy the increasing demand of building large-scale knowledge repositories with the explosion of Web texts
p68
aVAs the ranks decline before approaching the optimum, the performance gradually improves, implying that our approaches filter the noise in data and keep the principal information for classification via recovering the underlying low-rank data matrix
p69
aVWe contribute two optimization models, DRMC 11 11 It is the abbreviation for D istant supervision for R elation extraction with M atrix C ompletion -b and DRMC-1, aiming at exploiting the sparsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simultaneously
p70
aVTo tolerate the noise entries in the error matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc04' , we minimize the cost functions C x and C y for features and labels respectively, rather than using the hard constraints in Formula (2
p71
aVTable 2 lists the range of optimal ranks for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 on NYT u'\u005cu2019' 10 and NYT u'\u005cu2019' 13
p72
aVThe two widely used datasets that we adopt are both automatically generated by aligning Freebase to New York Times corpora
p73
aVFigure 4 (a) shows that our approaches achieve the significant improvement on performance
p74
aVThe intuition of the paradigm is that one can take advantage of several knowledge bases, such as WordNet 3 3 http://wordnet.princeton.edu , Freebase 4 4 http://www.freebase.com and YAGO 5 5 http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago , to automatically label free texts, like Wikipedia 6 6 http://www.wikipedia.org and New York Times corpora 7 7 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19 , based on some heuristic alignment assumptions
p75
aV[ 21 ] and its sub-methods (N-13, F-13 and NF-13) on NYT u'\u005cu2019' 13 dataset
p76
aVFirstly, we conduct experiments to compare our approaches with Mintz-09 [ 19 ] , MultiR-11 [ 13 ] , MIML-12 and MIML-at-least-one-12 [ 24 ] on NYT u'\u005cu2019' 10 dataset
p77
aVFurthermore, we discuss the influence of feature sparsity, and our approaches consistently achieve better performance than compared methods under different sparsity degrees
p78
aVSuch analogous cases commonly exist in feature extraction
p79
aVIn this paper, we formulate the relation-extraction task from a novel perspective of using matrix completion with low rank criterion

p81
aVThe matrix rank minimization problem is NP-hard
p82
aVWe bypass the description due to the limitation of space
p83
aVFurthermore, we discuss the influence of the feature sparsity for our approaches and the state-of-the-art methods
p84
aVAfter completing the entries in Y t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t , we adopt the sigmoid function to calculate the conditional probability of relation r j , given entity pair p i pertaining to y i u'\u005cu2062' j in Y t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t
p85
aVTheir approach is composed of several models, such as PCA [ 7 ] and collaborative filtering [ 15 ]
p86
aVTable 1 shows that the two datasets differ in some main attributes
p87
aVThe breakthrough work on this topic was made by Candès and Recht [ 5 ] who proved that most low-rank matrices can be perfectly recovered from an incomplete set of entries
p88
aVFigure 4 (b) illustrates that our approaches still outperform the state-of-the-art methods
p89
aVMoreover, Goldfrab and Ma [ 11 ] proved the convergence of the FPC algorithm for solving the nuclear norm minimization problem
p90
aVWe apply a new technique in the field of applied mathematics, i.e.,, low-rank matrix completion with convex optimization
p91
aVWe observe that for each approach, the optimal range is relatively stable
p92
aVOn both two datasets, we observe an identical phenomenon that the performance gradually increases as the rank of the matrix declines before reaching the optimum
p93
aVTable 2 also lists the range of optimal rank for DRMC-b and DRMC-1 with different u'\u005cu0398'
p94
aVAn intuitive explanation is that the high-rank matrix contains much noise and the model tends to be overfitting, whereas the matrix of excessively low rank is more likely to lose principal information and the model tends to be underfitting
p95
aVExperiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our noise-tolerant approaches outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods
p96
aVFigure 5 demonstrates that the ranks of data matrices are approximately 2,000 for the initial optimization of DRMC-b and DRMC-1
p97
aV[ 24 ] released the open source code 15 15 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/mimlre.shtml to reproduce the experimental results on those previous methods
p98
aVAfter recording the rank associated with the highest F1 score on each fold, we compute the mean and the standard deviation to estimate the range of optimal rank for testing
p99
aVThen, we can apply the log-likelihood cost function to measure the conditional probability and derive the logistic cost function for C x and C y
p100
aVIn order to conduct reliable experiments, we adjust and estimate the parameters for our approaches, DRMC-b and DRMC-1, and compare them with other four kinds of landmark methods [ 19 , 13 , 24 , 21 ] on two public datasets
p101
aV[ 16 ] proposed the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm which is fast and robust
p102
aVFigure 3 illustrates the curves of average F1 scores
p103
aVHowever, those high ranks result in poor performance
p104
aVWe thus adopt and modify the algorithm aiming to find the optima for our noise-tolerant models, i.e.,, Formulae (3) and (4
p105
aVIn this section, we discuss how our approaches tackle these natural flaws

aVThe linear classifier we adopt aims to explicitly learn the weight matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d × t and the bias column vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1b' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' t × 1 with the constraint of minimizing the loss function l
p112
aVIn practice, we record the rank of matrix Z at each round of iteration until it converges at a rather small threshold u'\u005cu0395' = 10 - 4

p123
aVWe also modify the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm [ 16 ] to find the global optimum
p124
aVWe use the five-fold cross validation on the validation set and evaluate the performance on each fold with different ranks
p125
aVThis promising theory has been successfully applied on many active research areas, such as computer vision [ 4 ] , recommender system [ 20 ] and system controlling [ 9 ]
p126
aVHowever, either bioinformatic database or WordNet is maintained by a few experts, thus hardly kept up-to-date
p127
aVAlgorithm 2 is similar to Algorithm 1 except for two differences
p128
aVSecond, a projection step is added to enforce the first column of matrix Z to be 1
p129

aVThis linear classification problem can be transformed into completing the unobservable entries in Y t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t by means of the observable entries in X t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n , Y t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n and X t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' t , based on the assumption that the rank of matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19' u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' ( n + m ) × ( d + t ) is low

p133
aVFormula (2) is usually impractical for real problems as the entries in the matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19' are corrupted by noise
p134
aVLet X t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n × d and Y t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' n × t denote the feature matrix and the label matrix for training, respectively
p135
aVMore specifically, we minimize the nuclear norm u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19'
p136
aVThey set u'\u005cu0398' = 5 in the original code by default
p137
aVEven though the FPC algorithm converges in iterative fashion, the value of u'\u005cu0395' varying with different datasets is difficult to be decided
p138
aVTherefore, Candés and Recht [ 5 ] suggested to use a convex relaxation, the nuclear norm minimization instead
p139
aVWe set u'\u005cu039b' = 1 to make the contribution of the cost function terms for feature and label matrices equal in Formulae (3) and (4 u'\u005cu039c' is assigned by a series of values obeying u'\u005cu039c' k + 1 = m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' x u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu039c' k u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0397' u'\u005cu039c' , u'\u005cu039c' F
p140
aVTherefore, this convex optimization model is called DRMC-b
p141
aVAlgorithm 1 describes the modified FPC algorithm for solving DRMC-b, which contains two steps for each iteration
p142
aVIn addition, The matrix gradient g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19' ) for DRMC-1 is
p143
aVThe surrogate of the function can be the convex nuclear norm u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19'
p144
aVIn this step, we infer the matrix gradient g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19' ) and bias vector gradient g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1b' ) as follows
p145
aVWe follow the suggestion in [ 10 ] that u'\u005cu039c' starts at u'\u005cu03a3' 1 u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu0397' u'\u005cu039c' , and u'\u005cu03a3' 1 is the largest singular value of the matrix Z
p146
aVTo accelerate the convergence, we use a continuation method to improve the speed u'\u005cu039c' is initialized by a large value u'\u005cu039c' 1 , thus resulting in the fast reduction of the rank at first
p147
aVThen we derive another optimization model called DRMC-1
p148
aVThe goal of this step is to minimize the nuclear norm u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc19'
p149
aVTherefore, we set u'\u005cu03a4' z = u'\u005cu03a4' b = 0.5 to satisfy the above constraints on both two datasets
