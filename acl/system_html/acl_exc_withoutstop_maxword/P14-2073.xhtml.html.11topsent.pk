VAs each token of the training data is ingested by the particle filter, we decide to insert that token into the reservoir, or not, independent of the other tokens in the current document
p1
aVThus, at the end of step i of the particle filter, each of the i tokens seen so far in the training sequence has an equal probability of being in the reservoir, hence being selected for rejuvenation

aVNow each particle p is propagated forward by drawing a topic z i ( p ) from the conditional posterior distribution u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc0f' ( z i ( p ) u'\u005cu2223' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' i - 1 ( p ) , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' i ) and scaling the particle weight by u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc0f' ( w i u'\u005cu2223' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' i - 1 ( p ) , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' i - 1
