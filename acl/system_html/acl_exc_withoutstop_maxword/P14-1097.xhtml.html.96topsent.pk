VOur method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames
p1
aVThen, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs
p2
aVBased on the best results in the above evaluations, we induced semantic frames using slot-word pair features, and then induced verb classes using slot-only features
p3
aVWe induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al
p4
aVWe first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al
p5
aVinduce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1
p6
aVWe evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al
p7
aVTo do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses
p8
aVTo output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb
p9
aVapply clustering to the initial frames based on the Chinese Restaurant Process [ 1 ] to produce verb-specific semantic frames
p10
aVThese two levels of evaluations are performed by considering the work of Reichart et al
p11
aVWe can use exactly the same clustering method as
