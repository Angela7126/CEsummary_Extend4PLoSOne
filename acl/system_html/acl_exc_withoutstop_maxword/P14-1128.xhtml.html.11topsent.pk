VRather than playing the u'\u005cu201c' hard u'\u005cu201d' uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging u'\u005cu201c' char-to-word u'\u005cu201d' alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning

aVCrucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u005cu2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]
p2
aVOne of our main objectives is to bias CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning on unlabeled data, under a non-linear GP constraint encoding the bilingual knowledge
