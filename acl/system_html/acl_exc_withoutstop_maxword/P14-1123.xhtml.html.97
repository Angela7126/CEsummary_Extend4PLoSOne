<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Accordingly, we will summarize the previously studied model, outline its limitations, show how our proposed measure addresses those limitations and compare the two measures for the task of automatic scoring of speech</a>
