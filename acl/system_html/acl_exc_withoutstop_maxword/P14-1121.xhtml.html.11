<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In another way, Rubino and Linar s (2011) improve the context words based on the hypothesis that a word and its candidate translations share thematic similarities</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In order to make co-occurrence counts more discriminant and in the same way as Hazem and Morin [ 15 ] , one strategy consists in addressing this problem through regression given training corpora of small and large size (abundant in the general domain), we predict word co-occurrence counts in order to make them more reliable</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes</a>
