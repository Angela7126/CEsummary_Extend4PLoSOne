VWe are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings
p1
aVThis prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality
p2
aVHowever, this prior work has not explored the linguistic basis of factuality judgments, which we show to depend on framing devices such as cue words
p3
aVSaurí and Pustejovsky ( 2012 ) propose a two-dimensional factuality annotation scheme, including polarity and certainty; they then build a classifier to predict annotations of factuality from statements in FactBank
p4
aVThis dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message
p5
aVRecent work in the area of computational social science focuses on understanding credibility cues on Twitter
p6
aVGiven the importance of cue words as a signal for factuality, we want to assess the factuality judgments induced by each cue
p7
aVWe explore the specific linguistic feature that affect factuality judgments, and compare our findings with previously-proposed groupings of factuality-related predicates
p8
aVWe present a new
