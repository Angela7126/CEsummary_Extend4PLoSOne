<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given samples of sign language videos (unknown sign language with one signer per video), our system performs the following steps to learn a feature representation (note that these video samples are separate from the video samples that are later used for classifier learning or testing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Second, it looks for activations of the learned representation (by convolution) and uses these activations to learn a classifier to discriminate between sign languages</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Extract small videos (hereafter called patches) randomly from anywhere in the video samples</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Normalize the patches</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our method performs two important tasks</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For the unsupervised feature learning, two types of patches are created</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Given the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We fix the size of the patches such that they all have r rows, c columns and f frames and we extract patches m times</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The extraction of classifier features through convolution and pooling is illustrated in figure</a>
