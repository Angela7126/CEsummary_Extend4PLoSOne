<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We have made similar obsevation that about a half of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations are absent in a Chinese semantic thesaurus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we extract words in the second, third and fifth levels to constitute hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym pairs (left panel, Figure 3</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>
