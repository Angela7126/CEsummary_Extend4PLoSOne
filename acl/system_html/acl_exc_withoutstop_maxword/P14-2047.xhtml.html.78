<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Next we examine if sentence u'\u2013' discourse divergence between languages and the presence of (ambiguous) discourse connectives would be more indicative of the expected translation quality</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For this reason we performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test for the translation quality of segments with discourse mismatch conditioned on whether the segment was 1-1 or 1-many</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This analysis gives lower bound on the translation quality degradation associated with discourse phenomena as it does not capture problems arising from connective ambiguity on the source side</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the ANOVA tests for each language, we compared the quality of segments which contained an ambiguous connective in the reference with those that do not, with systems treated as subjects</a>
