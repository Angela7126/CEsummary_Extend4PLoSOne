<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The type-level word boundary distributions, induced by the character-based alignment (VES-NO-GP), and the graph propagation (VES-GP-PL), are regarded as virtual evidences to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on the unlabeled data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Crucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The previous step contributes to generate bilingual segmentation supervisions, i.e.,, type-level word boundary distributions</a>
