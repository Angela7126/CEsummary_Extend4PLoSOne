VBelow, we reformulate the model from vector to tensor space
p1
aVAs mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u005cu201c' design freedom u'\u005cu201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one
p2
aVProperties of linear tensor model
p3
aVA linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors
p4
aVTo apply a tensor model, we first need to convert the feature vector into a tensor u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudebd'
p5
aVThe linear tensor model is illustrated in Figure 1
p6
aVSo what is the advantage of learning with a tensor model instead of a vector model
p7
aVA vector space linear model requires estimating 1,000,000 free parameters
p8
aVSpecifically, a vector is a 1 st order tensor, a matrix is a 2 nd order tensor, and data organized as a rectangular cuboid is a 3 rd order tensor etc
p9
aVThe order of a tensor affects the model in two ways the expressiveness of the model and the number of parameters to be estimated
p10
aVThis property makes the the tensor model very effective when training a large number of feature weights in a low-resource environment
p11
aVHowever if we use a 2
