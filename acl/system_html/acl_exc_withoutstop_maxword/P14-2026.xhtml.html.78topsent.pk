VFirst, we converted the constituent parse trees in the results of the Berkeley Parser into dependency parse trees by employing a tool in the Stanford Parser [ 2003 ]
p1
aVBy applying our rules and Wang et al u'\u005cu2019' s rules, one can use both dependency and constituency parsers for pre-ordering in Chinese-English PBSMT
p2
aVFurther, we define X and Y as the corresponding dependency structures of the dependency relations x and y , respectively
p3
aVIn our opinion, the reason for the great decrease was that the dependency parse trees were more concise than the constituent parse trees in describing sentences and they could also describe the reordering at the sentence level in a finer way
p4
aV2) Filter out the structures from which it was almost impossible to derive candidate pre-ordering rules because x or y was an u'\u005cu201c' irrespective
