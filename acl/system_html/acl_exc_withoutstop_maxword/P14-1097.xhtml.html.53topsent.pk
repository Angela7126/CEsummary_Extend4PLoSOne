VThen, we induce verb classes by clustering these verb-specific semantic frames across verbs
p1
aVOur method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames
p2
aVinduce verb classes by clustering the induced semantic frames across verbs as shown in the upper part of Figure 1
p3
aVTo do that, we induce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering verb uses
p4
aVBased on the best results in the above evaluations, we induced semantic frames using slot-word pair features, and then induced verb classes using slot-only features
p5
aVWe can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb
p6
aVWe induce verb-specific semantic frames from verb uses based on the method of Kawahara et al
p7
aVWe first evaluate our induced verb classes on the test set created by Korhonen et al
p8
aVIn this paper, we propose a two-step approach for inducing semantic frames and verb classes
p9
aVWe evaluate the single-class output for each verb based on the predominant gold-standard classes, which are defined for each verb in the test set of Korhonen et al
p10
aVinduce verb-specific semantic frames by clustering predicate-argument structures for each verb extracted from automatic parses as shown in the lower part of Figure 1 , and
