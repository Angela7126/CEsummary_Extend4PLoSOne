VAn edit-turn-pair is defined as a pair of an edit from a Wikipedia article u'\u005cu2019' s revision history and a turn from the discussion page bound to the same article
p1
aVWe propose a number of features which are purely based on the textual similarity between the text of the turn, and the edited text and context
p2
aVThe search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article u'\u005cu2019' s discussion page
p3
aVRoughly five hours after that turn was issued on the discussion page, user Sbharris added a wikilink to the u'\u005cu201c' History and etymology u'\u005cu201d' section of the article by performing the following edit
p4
aVSome of the false positives (i.e., non-corresponding pairs classified as corresponding) were caused by pairs where the revision (as judged by its comment or the edit context) is related to the turn text, however the specific edit in this pair is not
p5
aVSeveral of our features are based on metadata from both the edit and the turn
p6
aVHowever, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual edit
p7
aVSome features are based on the edit or the turn alone and do not take into account the pair itself
p8
aVThe 1,000 most frequent uni-, bi- and trigrams from the turn text are represented as binary features
p9
aVHowever, given the high price for a new corresponding edit-turn-pair (due to the high class imbalance in random data), we consider it as a useful starting point for research on edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia
p10
aVFurthermore, we deleted 21 pairs for which the turn segmentation algorithm clearly failed (e.g., when the turn text was empty
p11
aVThe context of an edit is defined as one preceding and one following paragraph of the edited paragraph
p12
aVIf an article has no discussion page, there are no edit-turn-pairs for this article
p13
aVPrevious work [ 11 , 4 ] has shown that these algorithms work well for edit and turn classification
p14
aVWe therefore define an edit-turn-pair as corresponding, if i) The turn is an explicit suggestion, recommendation or request and the edit performs this suggestion, recommendation or request, ii) the turn is an explicit reference or pointer and the edit adds or modifies this reference or pointer, iii) the turn is a commitment to an action in the future and the edit performs this action, and iv) the turn is a report of a performed action and the edit performs this action
p15
aVSimilarity has been calculated between i) the plain edit text and the turn text, ii) the edit and turn text after any wiki markup has been removed, iii) the plain edit context and turn text, and iv) the edit context and turn text after any wiki markup has been removed
p16
aVEdits are coherent modifications based on a pair of adjacent revisions from Wikipedia article pages
p17
aVTo assess the reliability of these annotations, one of the co-authors manually annotated a random subset of 100 edit-turn-pairs contained in ETP-gold as corresponding or non-corresponding
p18
aVAs baseline, we defined a majority class classifier, which labels all edit-turn-pairs as non-corresponding
p19
aVThis step is intended to make sure that we have a substantial number of corresponding pairs in the data for the final annotation study
p20
aVWe treat the automatic classification of edit-turn-pairs as a binary classification problem
p21
aVFinally, for the Mechanical Turk annotation study, we selected 500 random edit-turn-pairs from ETP-all excluding ETP-unconfirmed
p22
aVDue to the high class imbalance in the data, the majority class baseline sets a challenging accuracy score of .80
p23
aVIn the present study, we have analyzed cases where explicit coordination lead to implicit coordination and vice versa
p24
aVFrom ETP-all, a set of 262 edit-turn-pairs have been annotated as corresponding as part of a preliminary annotation study with one human annotator
p25
aVThe turn text includes the entire text from the turn
p26
aVFurthermore, we removed all edits which are part of a revision created by bots, based on the Wikimedia user group 2 2 http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_classes scheme
p27
aVIndividual turns are retrieved from topics by considering the revision history of the discussion page
p28
aVGiven the small size of ETP-gold, we did not assign a fixed train/test split to the data
p29
aVThe turkers were presented the turn text, the turn topic name, the edit in its context, and the edit comment (if present
p30
aVDue to their performative nature, we assume that these dialog acts make the turn they belong to a good candidate for a corresponding edit-turn-pair
p31
aVWikipedia, as one of the most prominent collaboratively created resources, offers its users a platform to coordinate their writing, the so called talk or discussion pages [ 18 ]
p32
aVAssuming that most edit-turn-pairs are non-corresponding, we expect a heavy imbalance in the class distribution
p33
aVA reduction of the feature set as judged by a u'\u005cu03a7' 2 ranker improved the results for both Random Forest as well as the SVM, so we limited our feature set to the 100 best features
p34
aVTo select good turkers and to block spammers, we carried out a pilot study on a small portion of manually confirmed corresponding and non-corresponding pairs, and required turkers to pass a qualification test
p35
aVTo understand the mistakes of the classifier, we manually assessed error patterns within the model of the Random Forest classifier
p36
aVCosine similarity, longest common subsequence, and word n-gram similarity were also applied to measure the similarity between the edit comment and the turn text as well as the similarity between the edit comment and the turn topic name
p37
aVThe low F1 on corresponding pairs is likely due to the small number of training examples
p38
aVTo keep the class imbalance within reasonable margins, we limited the time span between edits and turns to 86,000 seconds (about 24 hours
p39
aVWe counted an edit-turn-pair as corresponding, if it was annotated as u'\u005cu201c' corresponding u'\u005cu201d' by least three out of five annotators, and likewise for non-corresponding pairs
p40
aVMost of the resources used for collaborative writing do not explicitly allow their users to interact directly, so that the implicit effort of coordination behind the actual writing is not documented
p41
aVBased on an automatic classification using the model presented in our previous work [ 7 ] , we excluded edits classified as Vandalism, Revert or Other
p42
aVEach edit-turn-pair could be labeled as u'\u005cu201c' corresponding u'\u005cu201d' , u'\u005cu201c' non-corresponding u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' can u'\u005cu2019' t tell u'\u005cu201d'
p43
aVIt was important to find a reasonable amount of corresponding edit-turn-pairs before the actual annotation could take place, as we needed a certain amount of positive seeds to keep turkers from simply labeling pairs as non-corresponding all the time
p44
aVFor the same reason, we did not further divide the data into train/test and development data
p45
aVBoth of these may be part of a corresponding edit-turn-pair, according to our definition in Section 2
p46
aVWe therefore expect to cover the vast majority of corresponding edit-turn-pairs within a search space of 24 hours
p47
aVThis was calculated as 1 N u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2211' i = 1 N u'\u005cu2211' c = 1 C v i c C , where N = 750 is the overall number of annotated edit-turn-pairs, C = R 2 - R 2 is the number of pairwise comparisons, R = 5 is the number of raters per edit-turn-pair, and v i c = 1 if a pair of raters c labeled edit-turn-pair i equally, and 0 otherwise
p48
aVMore details follow in Section 2
p49
aVWe recorded whether the name of the edit user and the turn user are equal, the absolute time difference between the turn and the edit, and whether the edit occurred before the turn
p50
aVFor each edit, we stored both the edited paragraph and its context from the old revision as well as the edited paragraph and context from the new revision
p51
aVFurthermore, we measured the length of the edit text and the length of the turn text
p52
aVIn our 24 hours search space, the probability to find a corresponding edit-turn-pair drops steeply for time spans of more than 6 hours
p53
aVKaltenbrunner and Laniado ( 2012 ) analyze the development of discussion pages in Wikipedia with respect to time and compare dependences between edit peaks in the revision history of the article itself and the respective discussion page
p54
aVThe inter-rater agreement between ETP-gold (majority votes over Mechanical Turk annotations) and our expert annotations on this subset is Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu039a' = .72
p55
aVThe result is a set of 13,331 edit-turn-pairs, referred to as ETP-all
p56
aVTurns are segments from Wikipedia discussion pages
p57
aVThe edit context includes the edited paragraph and one preceding and one following paragraph
p58
aVWe refer to this 262 edit-turn-pairs as ETP-unconfirmed
p59
aVAmong the false negatives, we found errors caused by a missing direct textual overlap between edit and turn text
p60
aVWe used Apache OpenNLP 4 4 http://opennlp.apache.org for the segmentation of edit and turn text
p61
aVFirst, we want to understand the nature of correspondence between Wikipedia article edits and discussion page turns
p62
aVThe edit text is composed of any inserted, deleted or relocated text from both the old and the new revision
p63
aVIn addition to that, Wikipedia stores all edits made to any of its pages in a revision history, which makes the actual writing process explicit
p64
aV{mdframed} [backgroundcolor=gray!30, linewidth=0pt, leftmargin=0, rightmargin=0, skipabove=4pt, skipbelow=3pt, innertopmargin=3pt, innerbottommargin=3pt] '' borax '' u'\u005cu2192' [[borax]] This is what we define as a corresponding edit-turn-pair
p65
aVIn these cases, the correspondence was indicated only (if at all) by some relationship between turn text and edit comment
p66
aVTo enable such interaction, we extract segments from discussion pages, called turns, and connect them to corresponding edits in the respective article
p67
aVEach pair of adjacent revisions found in the edit history of an article consists of one or more edits, which describe either inserted, deleted, changed or relocated text
p68
aVTheir study shows that both implicit coordination (on the article itself) and explicit coordination (on the discussion page of the article) play important roles for the improvement of article quality
p69
aVConsider the following snippet from the discussion page of the article u'\u005cu201c' Boron u'\u005cu201d' in the English Wikipedia
p70
aVWhile there are several studies which analyze the high-level relationship between discussion and edit activity in Wikipedia articles, very few have investigated the correspondence between edits and turns on the textual level
p71
aVDiscussion pages are then segmented into topics based upon the structure of the page
p72
aVAlong with each turn, we store the name of its user, the time stamp, and the name of the topic to which the turn belongs
p73
aVTo segment discussion pages into turns, we follow a procedure proposed by Ferschke et al
p74
aVWe used the cosine similarity, longest common subsequence, and word n-gram similarity measures
p75
aVEdits are associated with metadata from the revision they belong to, this includes the comment (if present), the user name and the time stamp
p76
aVThe process of user interaction in collaborative writing has been the topic of many studies in recent years [ 9 ]
p77
aVFurthermore, they observed that the edit peaks in articles and their discussion pages are mostly independent
p78
aVKittur and Kraut ( 2008 ) analyze correspondence between article quality and activity on the discussion page
p79
aVTo capture a fine-grained picture of changes to Wikipedia article pages, we rely on the notion of edits defined in our previous work [ 6 ]
p80
aV2007 ) propose 11 dimensions to classify discussion page turns
p81
aVOn February 16th of 2011, user JCM83 added the turn
p82
aVTraining and testing the classifier has been carried out with the help of the Weka Data Mining Software [ 12 ]
p83
aVWe used the Sweble parser [ 8 ] to remove Wiki markup
p84
aVThis might happen, when somebody corrects a spelling error in a paragraph that is heavily disputed on the discussion page
p85
aVIn the following, we list the features extracted from preprocessed edits and turns
p86
aV2012 ) which is the basis for our turn segmentation, there are several studies dedicated to discourse structure in Wikipedia
p87
aVWith the help of the Java Wikipedia Library [ 19 ] , we access discussion pages from a database
p88
aVCosine similarity was applied on binary weighted term vectors ( L 2 norm
p89
aVWe argue that linking these two resources helps to get a better picture of the collaborative writing process
p90
aVThe detection of correspondence between edits and turns is also relevant beyond Wikipedia
p91
aVIn correspondence with the distribution of class sizes in the training data, the cost for false negatives was set to 4, and for false positives to 1
p92
aVThey find that the development of a discussion page is often bound to the topic of the article, i.e., articles on time-specific topics such as events grow much faster than discussions about timeless, encyclopedic content
p93
aVThe word n-gram measure [ 15 ] calculates a Jaccard similarity coefficient on trigrams
p94
aVFirst, an automatic detection of corresponding edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia pages might help users of the encyclopedia to better understand the development of the article they are reading
p95
aVWe used DKPro TC [ 5 ] to carry out the machine learning experiments on edit-turn-pairs
p96
aVThis procedure successfully segmented 94 % of all turns in a corpus from the Simple English Wikipedia [ 11 ]
p97
aVWe recorded whether the edit is an insertion, deletion, modification or relocation
p98
aVInstead of having to read through all of the discussion page which can be an exhausting task for many of the larger articles in the English Wikipedia, users could focus on those discussions that actually had an impact on the article they are reading
p99
aVTo deal with the class imbalance problem, we applied cost-sensitive classification
p100
aVSecond, assuming that edits often introduce new knowledge to an article, it might be interesting to analyze how much of this knowledge was actually generated within the discourse on the discussion page
p101
aV2012 ) suggest four types of explicit performatives in their annotation scheme for dialog acts of Wikipedia turns
p102
aVA subsequent study [ 17 ] adds more dimensions, among these an explicit category for references to article edits
p103
aVTo calculate edits, a line-based diff comparison between the old revision and the new revision is made, followed by several post-processing steps
p104
aVA definition of correspondence is not straightforward in the context of edit-turn-pairs
p105
aVAmong the latter, Ferron and Massa ( 2014 ) analyze 88 articles and their discussion pages related to traumatic events
p106
aVIn this section, we will define the basic units of our task, namely edits and turns
p107
aV{mdframed} [backgroundcolor=gray!30, linewidth=0pt, leftmargin=0, rightmargin=0, skipabove=4pt, skipbelow=3pt, innertopmargin=3pt, innerbottommargin=3pt] Shouldn u'\u005cu2019' t borax be wikilinked in the u'\u005cu201c' etymology u'\u005cu201d' paragraph
p108
aVTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to detect corresponding edit-turn-pairs in the English Wikipedia fully automatically
p109
aVFurthermore, we will explain the kind of correspondence between edits and turns we are interested in
p110
aVWith the help of Amazon Mechanical Turk 1 1 www.mturk.com , we crowdsourced annotations on a corpus of edit-turn-pairs from 26 random English Wikipedia articles in various thematic categories
p111
aVIn particular, they find a correlation between the article edits and their discussions around the anniversaries of the events
p112
aVThis partially explains the high number of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs and the consequent class imbalance
p113
aVIn a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, we tested a Random Forest classifier [ 3 ] and an SVM [ 16 ] with polynomial kernel
p114
aVBesides the work by Ferschke et al
p115
aVFerschke et al
p116
aVThis dimension accounts for roughly 5 to 10% of all turns
p117
aVThe classification results for the above configuration are displayed in Table 1
p118
aVWe define all edit-turn-pairs which do not conform to the upper classification as non-corresponding
p119
aVThe most frequent dimensions in their sample are requests for coordination and requests for information
p120
aVTo rule out ambiguous cases, we created the Gold Standard corpus with the help of majority voting
p121
aVThe authors would like to give special thanks to Viswanathan Arunachalam and Dat Quoc Nguyen, who carried out initial experiments and the preliminary annotation study, and to Emily Jamison, who set up the Mechanical Turk task
p122
aVThe resulting 750 pairs have each been annotated by five turkers
p123
aVRather, hyperparameters were optimized using grid-search over multiple cross-validation experiments, aiming to maximize accuracy
p124
aVAmong these, we expect to find mostly non-corresponding pairs
p125
aVIn the following, we explain the step-by-step approach we chose to create a suitable corpus for the annotation study
p126
aVWith an overall macro-averaged F1 of .79, Random Forest yielded the best results, both with respect to precision as well as recall
p127
aVObviously, this is a fairly small dataset which does not cover a representative sample of articles from the English Wikpedia
p128
aVThis resulted in 128 corresponding and 508 non-corresponsing pairs, or 636 pairs in total
p129
aVAn alignment between edits in the company Wiki and issues discussed in email conversations, on mailing lists, or other forums, can be helpful to track the flow or generation of knowledge within the company
p130
aVBoth classifiers performed significantly better than the baseline (non-overlapping confidence intervals, see Table 1
p131
aVFrom ETP-unconfirmed, we selected 250 random edit-turn-pairs
p132
aVViégas et al
p133
aVWe consider this agreement high enough to draw conclusions from the annotations [ 2 ]
p134
aVWe applied various filters to avoid annotating trivial content
p135
aVSecond, we want to know the distinctive properties of corresponding edit-turn-pairs and how to use these to automatically detect corresponding pairs
p136
aVThe average pairwise percentage agreement over all pairs is 0.66
p137
aVWe refer to this dataset as ETP-gold
p138
aVThis work has been supported by the Volkswagen Foundation as part of the Lichtenberg-Professorship Program under grant No
p139
aVIn the limited scope of this paper, we will focus on two research questions

aVThis information can be useful to improve communication and knowledge sharing
