<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Specifically, we introduce a novel formulation for a neural network joint model (NNJM), which augments an n -gram target language model with an m -word source window</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In order to assign a probability to every source word during decoding, we also train a neural network lexical translation model (NNLMT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One issue with the S2T NNJM is that the probability is computed over every target word, so it does not explicitly model NULL-aligned source words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The probability is computed over every source word in the input sentence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Formally, our model approximates the probability of target hypothesis T conditioned on source sentence S</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this paper we use a basic neural network architecture and a lexicalized probability model to create a powerful MT decoding feature</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The decoding cost is based on a measurement of u'\u223c' 1200 unique NNJM lookups per source word for our Arabic-English system</a>
