VLinLearn denotes model combination by overloading the vector representation of queries u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2a' and documents u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1d' in the VW linear learner by incorporating arbitrary ranking models as dense features
p1
aVIn addition to dense domain-knowledge features, we incorporate arbitrary ranking models as dense features whose value is the score of the ranking model
p2
aVSince Wikipedia articles vary greatly in length, we restricted EN documents to the first 200 words after extracting the link graph to reduce the number of features for BM and VW models
p3
aVWe do not report combination results including the sparse BM model since they were consistently lower than the ones with the sparse VW model
