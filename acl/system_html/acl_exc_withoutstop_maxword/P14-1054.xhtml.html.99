<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u201c' soft constraint u'\u201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In our experiment, the Head noun and POS Tag are utilized as position sensitive features, which has been introduced in Section 3.1</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>To sum up, among the five candidate feature sets, the position feature is used as a singleton feature</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this paper, for a better demonstration of the constraint condition, we still use the Position Sensitive as the default setting to use the Head noun and the adjacent entity POS tag</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Only Omni-word feature is bin sensitive</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It is encoded by combining the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention</a>
