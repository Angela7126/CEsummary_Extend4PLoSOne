p1
aVOur approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features
p2
aVWe are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset
p3
