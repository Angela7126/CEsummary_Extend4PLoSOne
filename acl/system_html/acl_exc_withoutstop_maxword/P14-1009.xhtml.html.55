<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We conjecture that the lf 3-way tensor representation of transitive verbs leads to a stronger asymmetry between sentences with inverted arguments, and thus makes this model particularly sensitive to word order differences</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this case, however, the traditional lf model (average difference .044, standard deviation .092) outperforms plf</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If distributional vectors encode certain aspects of word meaning, it is natural to expect that similar aspects of sentence meaning can also receive vector representations, obtained compositionally from word vectors</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the tfds task, not surprisingly the add and mult models, lacking determiner representations and being order-insensitive, fail to distinguish between true paraphrases and foils (indeed, for the mult model foils are significantly closer to the targets than the paraphrases, probably because the latter have lower content word overlap than the foils, that often differ in word order and determiners only</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our plf approach is able to handle determiners and word order correctly, as demonstrated by a highly significant ( p 0.01 ) difference between paraphrase and foil similarity (average difference in cosine .017, standard deviation .077</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Tensor by vector multiplication formalizes function application and serves as the general composition method</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The add (additive) model produces the vector of a sentence by summing the vectors of all content words in it</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Indeed, if we limit evaluation to those foils characterized by word order changes only, lf discriminates between paraphrases and foils even more clearly, whereas the plf difference, while still significant, decreases slightly</a>
