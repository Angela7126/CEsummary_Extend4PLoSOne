<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Lastly, we require that sentences are drawn from the cluster that they represent and that the number of sentences in the summary corresponding to each non-leaf cluster c is equivalent to the number of child clusters of c</a>
