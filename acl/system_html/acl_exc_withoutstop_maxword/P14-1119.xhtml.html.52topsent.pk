VExternal resource-based features are computed based on information gathered from resources other than the training documents, such as lexical knowledge bases (e.g.,, Wikipedia) or the Web, with the goal of improving keyphrase extraction performance by exploiting external knowledge
p1
aVAn evaluation error occurs when a system outputs a candidate that is semantically equivalent to a gold keyphrase, but is considered erroneous by a scoring program because of its failure to recognize that the predicted phrase and the corresponding gold keyphrase are semantically equivalent
p2
aVThis pairwise ranking approach therefore introduces competition between candidate keyphrases, and has been shown to significantly outperform KEA [ 56 , 12 ] , a popular supervised baseline that adopts the traditional supervised classification approach [ 46 , 23 ]
p3
aVWhile empirical results show that KeyCluster performs better than both TextRank and Hulth u'\u005cu2019' s [ 20 ] supervised system, KeyCluster has a potential drawback by extracting keyphrases from each topic cluster, it essentially gives
