<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rooted sentence subtree only selects rooted sentence subtrees 2 2 We achieved this by making R c u'\u2062' ( i ) only return the parser u'\u2019' s root node in Figure 7</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We can set the candidate for the root node of the subtree by using constraint ( 7</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The [ u'\u22c5' ] indicates the word that the system selected as the root of the subtree</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As we can see, subtree selection only selected important subtrees that did not include the parser u'\u2019' s root, e.g.,, purpose-clauses and that-clauses</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>First, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Constraints ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are tree constraints for a document tree and sentence</a>
