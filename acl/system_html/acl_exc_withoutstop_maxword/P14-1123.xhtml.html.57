<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with the human scores</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, the inclusion of the MaxEnt-based measure of syntactic complexity results in improved agreement between machine and human scores compared to the state-of-the-art model (here, Base</a>
