VIf the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels
p1
aVIf a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1
p2
aVIn this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words
p3
aVWhile classifying a test document, its probability distribution over class labels is inferred using TS-LDA model and it is classified to its most probable class label
p4
aVAs in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents
p5
aVWe then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents
p6
aVWe name this model as Topic Sprinkled LDA (TS-LDA
p7
aVIf more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t
p8
aV[] used LDA
p9
