<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Simply taking the union of the hand-labeled data and the corpus labeled by distant supervision is not effective since hand-labeled data will be swamped by a larger amount of distantly labeled data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Instead we propose to perform feature selection to generalize human labeled data into training guidelines , and integrate them into latent variable model</a>
