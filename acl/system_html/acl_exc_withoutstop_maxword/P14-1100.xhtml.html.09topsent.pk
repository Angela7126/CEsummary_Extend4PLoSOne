VAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p1
aVWe associate each sentence with an undirected latent tree graphical model, which is a tree consisting of both observed variables (corresponding to the words in the sentence) and an additional set of latent variables that are unobserved in the data
p2
aVThe Chow-Liu algorithm essentially computes the distances among all pairs of variables (the negative of the mutual information) and then finds the minimum cost tree
p3
aV§3.1 and §3.2 largely describe existing background on additive tree metrics and latent tree structure learning, while §3.3 and §3.4 discuss novel aspects
