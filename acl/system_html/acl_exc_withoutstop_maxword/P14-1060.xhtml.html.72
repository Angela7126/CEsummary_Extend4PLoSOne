<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While word embeddings and language models from such methods have been useful for tasks such as relation classification, polarity detection, event coreference and parsing; much of existing literature on composition is based on abstract linguistic theory and conjecture, and there is little evidence to support that learnt representations for larger linguistic units correspond to their semantic meanings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For composing the motifs representations to get judgments on semantic similarity of sentences, we use our recent Vector Tree Kernel approach The VTK approach defines a convolutional kernel over graphs defined by the dependency parses of sentences, using a vector representation at each graph node that representing a single lexical token</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For this task, the motif based distributional embeddings vastly outperform a conventional distributional model (DSM) based on token distributions, as well as additive (AVM) and multiplicative (MVM) models of vector compositionality, as proposed by Lapata et al</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is the overarching theme of this work we present a frequency driven paradigm for extending distributional semantics to phrasal and sentential levels in terms of such semantically cohesive, recurrent lexical units or motifs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While works such as the SDSM model suffer from the problem of sparsity in composing structures beyond bigrams and trigrams, methods such as Mitchell and Lapata ( 2008 ) and [ 22 ] and Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh ( 2011 ) are restricted by significant model biases in representing semantic composition by generic algebraic operations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is not unexpected the supervision provided to the model is very weak due to a lack of negative examples (which leads to spurious motif taggings, leading to a low precision), as well as no examples of transitions between adjacent motifs (to learn transitional weights and penalties</a>
