VWe obtain a final similarity score by weighted addition of the 3 cues, with the optimal weights determined by linear regression on separate msrvid train data that were also provided by the SemEval task organizers (before combining, we checked that the collinearity between cues was low
p1
aVFor instance, symmetric operations like vector addition are insensitive to syntactic structure, therefore meaning differences encoded in word order are lost in composition pandas eat bamboo is identical to bamboo eats pandas
p2
aVIn the tfds task, not surprisingly the add and mult models, lacking determiner representations and being order-insensitive, fail to distinguish between true paraphrases and foils (indeed, for the mult model foils are significantly closer to the targets than the paraphrases, probably because the latter have lower content word overlap than the foils, that often differ in word order and determiners only
p3
aVDespite positive empirical evaluation, this approach is hardly practical for general-purpose semantic language processing, since it requires computationally expensive approximate parameter optimization techniques, and it assumes task-specific parameter learning whose results are not meant to generalize across tasks
p4
aVThe representation size grows linearly, not exponentially, for higher semantic types, allowing for simpler and more efficient parameter estimation, storage, and computation
p5
aV[ 23 , 24 ] , the Baroni and Zamparelli method does not require manually labeled data nor costly iterative estimation procedures, as it relies on automatically extracted phrase vectors and on the analytical solution of the least-squares-error problem
p6
aVThese rules incorporate insights of two empirically successful models, lexical function and
