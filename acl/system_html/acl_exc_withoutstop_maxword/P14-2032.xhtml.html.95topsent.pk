VIn this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition
p1
aVFinally, since dual decomposition is a method of joint decoding, it is still liable to reproduce errors made by the constituent systems
p2
aVDual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]
p3
aVIn this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition
p4
aVA powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in
