<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>These systems combine (i) a score based on the background ( KL back , TS or SR ) with (ii) the score based on the input only ( KL inp</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, to combine TS sum and KL inp for each sentence, we compute its scores based on the two methods</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Words with - 2 u'\u2062' log u'\u2061' u'\u039b' 10 are considered topic words u'\u2019' s system gives a weight of 1 to the topic words and scores sentences using the number of topic words normalized by sentence length</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To reduce redundancy, once a sentence is added, the topic words contained in it are removed from the topic word list before the next sentence selection</a>
