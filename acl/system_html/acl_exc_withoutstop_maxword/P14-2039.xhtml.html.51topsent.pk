VAs the chunk size parameter increases, the performance of sliding window systems with different values of keep-length parameter converges
p1
aVSecond, the fixed window alignment algorithm requires longer chunks ( u'\u005cu2265' 10 seconds) to obtain reasonable accuracy, and thus introduces unsatisfactory latency
p2
aVThe chunk size directly determines the latency of the system to the end user, as alignment cannot begin until an entire chunk is captured
p3
aVIn order to address the problems described above, we explore a technique based on a sliding alignment window, shown in Algorithm 3
p4
aVFurthermore, we can see that for smaller values of the chunk size parameter, increasing the keep-length makes the system less accurate
p5
aVNext, we show the trade-off between computation speed and accuracy in Figure 3, as we fix the
