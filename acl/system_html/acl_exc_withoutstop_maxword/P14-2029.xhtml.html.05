<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We also evaluated the binary system for the ordinal task by computing correlations between its estimated probabilities and the averaged human scores, and we evaluated the ordinal system for the binary task by binarizing its predictions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We create a dataset of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences written by English language learners, labeled on an ordinal scale for grammaticality</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the ordinal task, we report Pearson u'\u2019' s r between the averaged human judgments and each system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, we used the same learning algorithms as for our system (i.e.,, ridge regression for the ordinal task and logistic regression for the binary task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we develop a system for the task of predicting the grammaticality of sentences, and present a dataset of learner sentences rated for grammaticality</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The system was designed for use with a dataset consisting of 50% grammatical and 50% ungrammatical sentences, rather than data with ordinal or continuous labels</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the u'\u2113' 2 -regularized linear regression model with an u'\u2113' 2 -regularized logistic regression and used Kendall u'\u2019' s u'\u03a4' rank correlation</a>
