<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In structural correspondence learning (SCL), the induced representation is based on the task of predicting the presence of pivot features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For each feature template, there are thousands of binary features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Consequently, many approaches rely on each instance having a relatively large number of active features, and fail to exploit the structured feature spaces that characterize syntactic tasks such as sequence labeling and parsing [ 25 ]</a>
