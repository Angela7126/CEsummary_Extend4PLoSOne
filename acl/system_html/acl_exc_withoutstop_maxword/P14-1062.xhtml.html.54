<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The binary result is based on a DCNN that has a wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a dynamic k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity; it has a second wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Increasing m or stacking multiple convolutional layers of the narrow type makes the range of the feature detectors larger; at the same time it also exacerbates the neglect of the margins of the sentence and increases the minimum size s of the input sentence required by the convolution</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For an example in sentiment prediction, according to the equation a first order feature such as a positive word occurs at most k 1 times in a sentence of length s , whereas a second order</a>
