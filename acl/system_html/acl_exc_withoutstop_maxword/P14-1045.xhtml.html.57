<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The outcome of the contextual annotation presented above is a rather sizeable dataset of validated semantic links, and we showed these linguistic judgments to be reliable</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>They can be divided in three groups, according to their origin they are computed from the whole corpus, gathered from the distributional resource, or extracted from the considered text which contains the semantic pair to be evaluated</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Smote synthetizes and adds new instances similar to the minority class instances and is more efficient than a mere resampling</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Intrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of [] as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method MetaCost of [] as a cost-aware learning method</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u201c' existential u'\u201d' view of semantic relatedness</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used</a>
