VIn this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning

aVWe extract lexical patterns that consist of polar words and negators 3 3 The polar words are identified using the MPQA lexicon and the negators are identified using a handful of seed words extended by the General Inquirer dictionary and WordNet as described in [ 2 ] and apply the heuristics based on compositional semantics [ 2 ] to assign a sentiment value to each pattern

aVSpecifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ]
