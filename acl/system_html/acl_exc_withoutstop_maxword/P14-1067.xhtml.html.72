<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, similarly to translation memories that incrementally store translated segments and evolve over time incorporating users style and terminology, all components of a CAT tool (the MT engine and the mechanisms to assign quality scores to the suggested translations) should take advantage of translators feedback</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>QE is generally cast as a supervised machine learning task, where a model trained from a collection of ( source, target, label ) instances is used to predict labels 1 1 Possible label types include post-editing effort scores ( e.g., 1-5 Likert scores indicating the estimated percentage of MT output that has to be corrected), HTER values [ 28 ] , and post-editing time ( e.g., seconds per word for new, unseen test items [ 31 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Among these, the necessity to model the diversity of human quality judgements and correction strategies [ 16 , 15 ] calls for solutions that i) account for annotator-specific behaviour, thus being capable of learning from inherently noisy datasets produced by multiple annotators, and ii) self-adapt to changes in data distribution, learning from user feedback on new, unseen test items</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For instance, moving from controlled lab testing scenarios to real working environments poses additional constraints in terms of adaptability of the QE models to the variable conditions of a translation job</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When operating with advanced CAT tools, translators are presented with suggestions (either matching fragments from a translation memory or automatic translations produced by an MT system) for each sentence of a source document</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As regards QE models, our work represents the first investigation on incremental adaptation by exploiting users feedback to provide targeted (system, user,</a>
