<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper investigates a variety of ways in which word embeddings might augment a constituency parser with a discrete state space</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To evaluate the embedding structure hypothesis, we take the Maryland featured parser, and replace the set of lexical template features used by that parser with a set of indicator features on a discretized version of the embedding</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For OOV words which are not in the dictionary of embeddings, we back off to the unknown word model for the underlying parser</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While word embeddings can be constructed directly from surface distributional statistics, as in LSA, more sophisticated tools for unsupervised extraction of word representations have recently gained popularity [ 3 , 10 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Dependency parsers have seen gains from distributional statistics in the form of discrete word clusters [ 9 ] , and recent work [ 2 ] suggests that similar gains can be derived from embeddings like the ones used in this paper</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It seems clear that word embeddings exhibit some syntactic structure</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The Maryland parser builds on the state-splitting parser, replacing its basic word emission model with a feature-rich, log-linear representation of the lexicon</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Embedding structure hypothesis</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>With extremely limited training data, parser extensions using word embeddings give modest improvements in accuracy (relative error reduction on the order of 1.5%</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In order to isolate the contribution from word embeddings, it is useful to demonstrate improvement over a parser that already achieves state-of-the-art performance without vector representations</a>
