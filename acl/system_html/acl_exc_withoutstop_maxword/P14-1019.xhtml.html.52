<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We split the sentence based on the ending punctuation, predict the parse tree for each segment and group the roots of resulting trees into a single node</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a result, the selected tag is influenced by a broad syntactic context above and beyond the initial tagging model and is directly optimized to improve parsing performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because the inference procedure is so simple, it is important that the parameters of the scoring function are chosen in a manner that facilitates how we climb the scoring function in small steps</a>
