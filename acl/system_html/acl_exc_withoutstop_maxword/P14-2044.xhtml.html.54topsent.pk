VExponentiating the prior reduces the number of induced clusters and improves results, as it can change the cluster assignment for some words where the likelihood strongly prefers one cluster but the prior clearly indicates another
p1
aVWe can create an infinite mixture model by combining the ddCRP prior with a likelihood function defining the probability of the data given the cluster assignments
p2
aVHowever, almost half the gold standard clusters in MTE contain just a few words and we do not expect our model to be able to learn them anyway, so the 1-1 measure is still useful for telling us how well the model learns the bigger and more distinguishable classes
p3
aVIn this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model
