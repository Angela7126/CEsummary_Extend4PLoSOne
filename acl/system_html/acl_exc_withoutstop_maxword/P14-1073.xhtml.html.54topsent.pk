VTo select a parent for a mention x of type t = x e t , a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and u'\u005cu2662' is selected with probability proportional to u'\u005cu0391' t 0
p1
aVOur model is an evolutionary generative process based on the name variation model of , which stipulates that names are often copied from previously generated names, perhaps with mutation (spelling edits
p2
aVThus, our sampled phylogenies tend to make similar names coreferent u'\u005cu2014' especially long or unusual names that would be expensive to generate repeatedly, and especially in contexts that are topically similar and therefore have a higher prior probability of coreference
p3
aVName similarity is also an important component
