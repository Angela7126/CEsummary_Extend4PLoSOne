VTherefore, we assume that a lexical resource L can be represented as an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) where V is the set of nodes, i.e.,, the concepts defined in the resource, and E is the set of undirected edges, i.e.,, semantic relations between concepts
p1
aVHowever, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm
p2
aVHere, we describe how the four semantic graphs for our four lexical resources (i.e.,, wn , wp , wt , ow ) were constructed
p3
aVThe other two resources, i.e.,, wt and ow , do not provide a reliable network of semantic relations, therefore we used our ontologization approach to construct their corresponding semantic graphs
p4
aVHowever, not all lexical resources provide explicit semantic relations between concepts and, hence, machine-readable dictionaries like Wiktionary have first to be transformed into semantic graphs before such graph-based approaches can
