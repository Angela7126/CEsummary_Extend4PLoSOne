VAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p1
aVHowever, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more complicated than in observed models
p2
aVIntuitively, however, latent tree models encode low rank dependencies among the observed variables permitting the development of u'\u005cu201c' spectral u'\u005cu201d' methods that can lead to provably correct solutions
p3
aVIn particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies
