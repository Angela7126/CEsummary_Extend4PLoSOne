<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The fact that parsers achieve low accuracies on punctuations is to some degree expected, because the head of a punctuation mark is linguistically less well-defined</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since long sentences are inherently more difficult to parse, to make a fair comparison, we further divide the development set according to sentence lengths as shown in the first row</a>
