<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first step finds an adjoining location by searching through our sentence to find any subtree with a root whose label matches the root node of the auxiliary tree</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An entire initial tree can replace a leaf node in the sentence tree whose label matches the label of the root of the initial tree in a process called u'\u201c' substitution u'\u201d' Auxiliary trees, on the other hand, encode recursive structures of language</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus we use as a reward a measure of the match between the semantic annotation of the partial tree and the communicative goal</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The u'\u201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was</a>
