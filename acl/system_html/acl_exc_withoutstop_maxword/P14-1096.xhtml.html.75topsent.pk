VIf a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above
p1
aVAn element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods
p2
aVIf a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time periods
p3
aVColumns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u005cu2018' birth cluster u'\u005cu2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes
p4
aVWe did this evaluation for the candidate birth, join and split sense clusters obtained by comparing 1909-1953 time period with respect to 2002-2005
p5
aVFor a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case
p6
aVWe, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change
p7
aVTable 3 shows the evaluation results for a few candidate words, flagged due to birth
p8
aVSince we can not expect a perfect split, birth etc., we used certain threshold values to detect if a candidate word is undergoing sense change via one of these four cases
p9
aVFor the join case, we find WordNet synset ids s 1 and s 2 for the clusters obtained in the source time period and s n u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' w for the join cluster in the target time period
p10
aVDuring evaluation, we considered the clusters obtained using the 1909-1953 time-slice as our reference and attempted to track sense change by comparing these with the clusters obtained for 2002-2005
p11
aVIn summary, the aligner tool takes as input the CW cluster and returns a WordNet synset id that corresponds to the cluster words
p12
aVWe next describe our algorithm for detecting sense change from these sets of sense clusters
p13
aVSince it was difficult to go through all the candidate sense changes for all the comparisons manually, we decided to randomly select some candidate words, which were flagged by our algorithm as undergoing sense change, while comparing 1909-1953 and 2002-2005 DT
p14
aVSince we aim to detect this change automatically, we
