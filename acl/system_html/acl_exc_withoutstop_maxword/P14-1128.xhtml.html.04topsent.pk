VThis section aims to further analyze the three primary observations concluded in Section 4.3 i ) word segmentation is useful to SMT; i u'\u005cu2062' i ) the treebank and the bilingual segmentation knowledge are helpful, performing segmentation of different nature; and i u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' i ) the bilingual constraints lead to learn segmentations better tailored for SMT

aVRather than playing the u'\u005cu201c' hard u'\u005cu201d' uses of the bilingual segmentation knowledge, i.e.,, directly merging u'\u005cu201c' char-to-word u'\u005cu201d' alignments to words as supervisions, this study extracts word boundary information of characters from the alignments as soft constraints to regularize a CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning
