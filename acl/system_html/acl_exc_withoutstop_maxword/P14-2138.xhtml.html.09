<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe two experiments aimed at quantifying the importance of the discriminative words and the indicative character bigrams that are identified by Algorithm 2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Algorithm 2 summarizes our method of identifying the discriminative words and indicative character bigrams</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results are shown in the Discriminative Words column of Table 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The words that are identified as the most discriminative include function words, punctuation, very common content words, and the toponymic terms</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We are interested in identifying the character bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words in order to quantify their impact on the bigram-based classifier</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The results of this experiment are reported in the Indicative Bigrams column of Table 2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The results are shown in the Random Words column of Table 2</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For comparison, the Random Bigrams column of Table 2 shows the mean accuracy over 100 trials obtained when 20 bigrams randomly selected from the set of 200 bigrams are replaced with random bigrams from outside of the set</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Using Algorithm 2 , we identify the top 20 character bigrams, and replace them with randomly selected bigrams</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the first experiment, we showed that the removal of the 100 most discriminative words from the training data results</a>
