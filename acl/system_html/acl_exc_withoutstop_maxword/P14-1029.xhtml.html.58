<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Data As described earlier, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] has manually annotated, real-valued sentiment values for all phrases in parse trees</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That is, the model parameters are only based on the sentiment value of the arguments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that the two neural network based models incorporate the syntax and semantics by representing each node with a vector</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This corpus provides us with the data to further understand the quantitative behavior of negators, as the effect of negators can now be studied with arguments of rich syntactic and semantic variety</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This shifting model is based on negators and the polarity of the text they modify constants can be different for each negator-polarity pair</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The table shows that the basic reversing and shifting heuristics do capture negators u'\u2019' behavior to some degree, as their MAE scores are higher than that of the baseline</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Polarity-based shifting As will be shown in our experiments, negators can have different shifting power when modifying a positive or a negative phrase</a>
