<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This penalty exchange is similar to message passing, and as the penalty accumulates over iterations, the two models are pushed towards agreeing with each other</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Finally, since dual decomposition is a method of joint decoding, it is still liable to reproduce errors made by the constituent</a>
