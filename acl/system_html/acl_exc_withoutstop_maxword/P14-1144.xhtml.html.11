<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We cast the problem of predicting an essay u'\u2019' s prompt adherence score as 13 regression problems, one for each prompt</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To obtain feature values of the first type, we take the RI similarities between the whole essay and each set of prompt adherence keywords from the prompt u'\u2019' s components</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our RI feature set necessarily excludes those features from Higgins et al. that are not easily translatable to our problem since we are concerned with an entire essay u'\u2019' s adherence to its prompt rather than with each of its sentences u'\u2019' relatedness to the prompt</a>
