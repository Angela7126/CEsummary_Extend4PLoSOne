VThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p1
aVFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p2
aVObviously the skeleton used in this work can be viewed as a simplified sentence
p3
aVAs is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is used to assign a model score
