VWe investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity
p1
aVTherefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms
p2
aVString alignment is closely related to the task of sequence alignment in computational biology

aV2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language
p4
aVAlgorithms for string alignment were successfully used for identifying cognates based on both their forms, orthographic and phonetic
p5
aVTherefore, to align pairs of words we employ the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [ 29 ] , which is mainly used for aligning sequences of proteins or nucleotides
p6
aVFor measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input
p7
aVIn addition, we use SpSim [ 11 ] , which outperformed the longest common subsequence ratio and a similarity measure based on the edit distance in previous experiments
p8
aVFirst, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes
p9
aVThe algorithm uses dynamic programming and, thus, guarantees to find the optimal alignment
