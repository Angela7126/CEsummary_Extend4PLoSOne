VSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs
p1
aVtraining set irregular MWEs merged into one token, regular MWEs are structured, and integration of regular MWE information into the labels ( FCT_r_POS
p2
aVparsing i) MWE analysis with classification of MWEs into regular or irregular, (ii) merge of predicted irregular MWEs, (iii) tagging and morphological prediction, (iv) parsing
p3
aVThe evaluation on the labeled representation provides an evaluation of the full task (parsing, regular/irregular MWE recognition and regular MWEs structuring), with a UAS that is less impacted by errors on regular MWE status, while LAS reflects the full difficulty
