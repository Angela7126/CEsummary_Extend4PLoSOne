p7
aVThen questions are generated and stored by question type in a question hash table
p8
aVThe vast majority of systems generate questions by selecting one sentence at a time, extracting portions of the source sentence, then applying transformation rules or patterns in order to construct a question
p9
aV2013), which used semantic role labeling to identify patterns in the source text from which questions can be generated
p10
aVThe pattern that generated Question 1 requires argument A1 (underlined in Table 2) and a causation ArgM (italicized
p11
aVThe file has 93 sentences and our system generated 184 questions; the LPN W system generated roughly 4 times as many questions
p12
aV1) evaluation of our generated questions, (2) comparison of our generated questions with those from Heilman and Smith u'\u005cu2019' s question generator, and (3) comparison of our generated questions with those from Lindberg, Popowich, Nesbit and Winne
p13
aVThe ArgM (underlined) becomes part of the question, while the rest of the source sentence forms the answer
p14
aVThe patterns are designed to match only the arguments used as part of the question or the answer, in order to prevent over generation of questions
p15
aVAdditionally, patterns indicate the semantic arguments that provide the answer to the question, required fields, and filter condition fields
p16
aVThe ability to generate questions from any predicate-argument set means that sentence simplification is not required as a preprocessing step, and that the sentence can match multiple patterns
p17
aVThe pattern that generated Question 2 requires A0, A1 and a verb whose lexical form is mean (V=mean in Table 1
p18
aVThis task utilized a file (Biology the body) with 56 source sentences from which our system generated 102 questions
p19
aVTable 2 provides examples of generated questions
p20
aVQuestion 3 is from the source sentence u'\u005cu2019' s 3rd predicate-argument set because this matched the pattern requirements
p21
aVThis work most closely parallels our own with a few exceptions our system only asks questions that can be answered from the source text, our approach is domain-independent, and the patterns also identify the answer to the question
p22
aVFor example, this sentence could also match patterns to generate questions such as
p23
aVFrom each system, 100 questions were randomly selected, making sure that the LPN W questions did not include questions generated from domain-specific templates such as
p24
aVSome question generation systems simplify complex sentences in initial stages of their system
p25
aVFor each predicate and its associated semantic arguments, a matcher function is called which will return a list of patterns that match the source sentence u'\u005cu2019' s predicate-argument structure
p26
aVThis pattern also requires that ArgM contain nouns (AxNN from Table 1), which helps filter vague questions
p27
aVSENNA produces separate semantic role labels for each predicate in the sentence
p28
aVIn this pattern, A1 (italicized) forms the answer and A0 (underlined) becomes part of the question along with the appropriate form of do
p29
aVThis pattern supplies the word indicate instead of the source text u'\u005cu2019' s mean which broadens the question context
p30
aVThis pattern takes the copular be as it appears in the source text
p31
aVBased on this sample of questions there is no significant difference in linguistic scores for questions generated at various predicate positions
p32
aVThe questions again were presented with accompanying paragraphs of the source text
p33
aVApproaches to automatic question generation from text span nearly four decades
p34
aVA recent approach from Heilman and Smith (2009, 2010) uses syntactic parsing and transformation rules to generate questions
p35
aVCoreference resolution, which could help avoid vague question generation, is discussed in Section 5
p36
aVBonds) which had 59 sentences, from which the system generated 142 questions
p37
aVSENNA provides the tokenizing, pos tagging, syntactic constituency parsing and semantic role labeling used in the system
p38
aVHowever, the task here is to explore the linguistic quality of generated questions
p39
aVPatterns specify whether verbs should be included in their lexical form or as they appear in the source text
p40
aVThis paper focuses on evaluating generated questions primarily in terms of their linguistic quality, as did Heilman and Smith (2010a
p41
aVSyntactic, sentence-level approaches outnumber other approaches as seen in the Question Generation Shared Task Evaluation Challenge 2010 (Boyer and Piwek, 2010) which received only one paragraph-level, semantic entry
p42
aVThe uniqueness of their work lies in their use of discourse cues to extract semantic content for question generation
p43
aVFor example, a filter for personal pronouns will prevent a question being generated with an argument that starts with a personal pronoun
p44
aVFor a comparison with the Lindberg, Popowich, Nesbit and Winne system we used a file (Earth science weather fronts) that seemed most similar to the text files for which their system was designed
p45
aVTable 1 shows selected required and filter fields, Section 3.3 gives examples of their use
p46
aVThe purpose of this evaluation was to determine if any patterns consistently produce poor questions
p47
aVThe Heilman and Smith system, as they describe it, takes an over-generate and rank approach
p48
aVSince our focus is on expository text, system patterns deal primarily with the present and simple past tenses
p49
aVAs these patterns are matched, they will be rejected as candidates for generation for a particular sentence if the required arguments are absent or if filter conditions are present
p50
aVIn order to generate questions, passages were selected from science textbooks downloaded from www.ck12.org
p51
aVThe average score by predicate position is shown in Table 3
p52
aVQuestion 4 requires A1 and an ArgM that includes the discourse cue if
p53
aVFirst, the source text is divided into sentences which are processed by SENNA 1 1 http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/ software, described in (Collobert et al., 2011
p54
aVHeilman and Smith chose to filter out questions with personal pronouns, possessive pronouns and noun phrases composed simply of determiners such as those
p55
aVIt means that the universe is expanding , we do not want to generate a vague question such as
p56
aVQuestions from the two systems were randomly intermingled
p57
aVArgawal, Shah and Mannem (2011) continue the paragraph-level approach using discourse cues to find appropriate text segments upon which to construct questions at a deeper conceptual level
p58
aVThe system at the time of this evaluation had 42 patterns
p59
aVAs seen in Table 4, our results represent a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to Heilman and Smith on the average rating over all metrics, and as high as 61% reduction in the error rate on grammaticality judgments
p60
aVThe answer is the text from the A2 argument
p61
aVThe system inserted the correct forms of release and do , and ignored the phrase As this occurs since it is not part of the semantic argument
p62
aVIn a related work (Mazidi and Nielsen, 2014) we evaluated the quality of the questions and answers from a pedagogical perspective, and our approach outperformed comparable systems in both linguistic and pedagogical evaluations
p63
aVThe comparison results are shown in Table 5
p64
aVA novel question generator by Curto et al
p65
aVHowever, most patterns use the lexical form of the main verb along with the appropriate form of the auxiliary do (do, does, did), for the subject-auxiliary inversion required in forming interrogatives
p66
aVCare must be taken not to generate questions based on one predicate in the catenative construction
p67
aVTwo annotators evaluated each set of questions using Likert-scale ratings from 1 to 5, where 5 is the best rating, for grammaticality, clarity, and naturalness
p68
aVThe most common use of the verb as it appears in the sentence is with the verb be , as in
p69
aVHere we briefly describe three challenges negation detection, coreference resolution, and verb forms
p70
aVA well-known early work is Wolfe u'\u005cu2019' s AUTOQUEST (Wolfe, 1976), a syntactic pattern matching system
p71
aVThe system consists of a straightforward pipeline
p72
aVThe system was created using SENNA and Python
p73
aVInterestingly, our system again achieved a 44% reduction in the error rate when averaging over all metrics, just as it did in the Heilman and Smith comparison
p74
aVNot having coreference resolution leads to vague questions, some of which can be filtered as discussed previously
p75
aVThe aim of this work is to automatically generate questions for such pedagogical purposes
p76
aVLindberg et al used the emPronoun system from Charniak and Elsner, which only handles personal pronouns
p77
aVWe compared our system to the H S and LPN W systems because they produce questions that are the most similar to ours, and for the same purpose reading comprehension reinforcement
p78
aVNote that the Rating column gives the average of the grammaticality, clarity and naturalness scores
p79
aVThese approaches can potentially ask deeper questions due to their focus on semantics
p80
aVExperiments with existing coreference software performed well only for personal pronouns, which occur infrequently in most expository text
p81
aVIn our approach this is unnecessary, and simplifying could miss many valid questions
p82
aVPlant roots and bacterial decay use carbon dioxide in the process of respiration, the word use was classified as NN, leaving no predicate and no semantic role labels in this sentence
p83
aVHowever, further work on filters is needed to avoid questions such as
p84
aVThe average linguistics score per pattern in this evaluation was 5.0 to 4.18
p85
aVNatural language generation faces many linguistic challenges
p86
aVThey generate questions of types why , when , give an example , and yes/no
p87
aVWe only took questions that scored a 2.0 or better with their ranking system, 4 4 In our experiments, their rankings ranged from very small negative numbers to 3.0 which resulted in less than 27% of their top questions
p88
aVSince current state-of-the-art systems do not deal well with relative and possessive pronouns, this will continue to be a limitation of natural language generation systems for the time being
p89
aVAnnotators were given instructions to read a paragraph, then the questions based on that paragraph
p90
aVAnnotators gave 1 - 5 scores for each category of grammaticality, clarity and naturalness
p91
aVIn all, 84 of their questions were evaluated
p92
aVImporting NLTK within Python provides a simple interface to WordNet from which we determine the lexical form of verbs
p93
aVCurrently, our system does not use any type of coreference resolution
p94
aVAnother recent approach is Lindberg et al
p95
aVThe pattern also filters out sentences with A0 or A2
p96
aVEither form will include subsequent particles such as
p97
aVThe Heilman and Smith system is available online; 3 3 http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/mheilman/questions/ Lindberg graciously shared his code with us
p98
aVIn contrast to the above systems, other approaches have an intermediate step of transforming input into some sort of semantic representation
p99
aVThe passages average around 60 sentences each, and represent chapter sections
p100
aVCommon English verbs that can be light verbs include give, have, make, take
p101
aVThe most common error observed was confusion between the noun and verb roles of a word
p102
aVWe present results on three linguistic evaluations
p103
aVThe error reduction calculation is shown below
p104
aVFor the experiments in this paper, we selected three passages from the subjects of biology, chemistry, and earth science, filtering out references to equations and figures

aVThis evaluation was conducted with one file (Chemistry
p108
aVTextbooks were chosen rather than hand-crafted source material so that a more realistic assessment of performance could be achieved
p109
aVLight verbs can either carry semantic meaning ( take your passport) or can be bleached of semantic content when combined with other words as in make a decision, have a drink, take a walk
p110
aV2012) leverages lexico-syntactic patterns gleaned from the web with seed question-answer pairs
p111
aVWe are also hindered at times by the performance of the part of speech tagging and parsing software
p112
aVFor our purposes we focused on negation as identified by the NEG label in SENNA which identified not in verb phrases
p113
aVExamples of this intermediate step can be found in Yao and Zhang (2010) which uses Minimal Recursive Semantics, and in Olney et al
p114
aVThe most commonly used semantic roles are A0, A1 and A2, as well as the ArgM modifiers
p115
aVLight verbs pose complications in NLG because they are highly idiosyncratic and subject to syntactic variability (Sag et al., 2002
p116
aVSENNA uses the 2005 PropBank coding scheme and we followed the documentation in (Babko-Malaya, 2005) for the patterns
p117
aVThe average inter-annotator agreement, allowing a difference of one between the annotators u'\u005cu2019' ratings was 88% and Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s r=0.47 was statistically significant (p 0.001), suggesting a high correlation and agreement between annotators
p118
aVWe were also interested to know if first predicates make better questions than later ones

aVThe average grade level is approximately grade 10 as indicated by the on-line readability scorer read-able.com
p127
aVNegation detection is a complicated task because negation can occur at the word, phrase or clause level, and because there are subtle shades of negation between definite positive and negative polarities (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011
p128
aVWe have left for future work the task of identifying other negative indicators, which occasionally does lead to poor question/answer quality as in the following
