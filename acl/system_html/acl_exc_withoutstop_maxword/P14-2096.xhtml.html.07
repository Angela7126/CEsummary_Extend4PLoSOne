<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then, for each English article and Chinese candidate pair in testing, the LDA model provides the distribution of the latent topics</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>English and Chinese terms are all regarded as terms of the same language and the LDA topic model, namely mixed-language topic model, generates both English and Chinese terms for each latent topic</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For pairs that have both English and Chinese articles, the Chinese article title is regarded as the translation of the English one</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To train the LDA model, the pair English and Chinese articles are concatenated into a single document</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The entropy of the estimated topic distribution of a related article is expected to be lower than that of an unrelated article</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Because of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article u'\u201c' Nero u'\u201d' and the corresponding Chinese article is low</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we propose a method comprising title and hypernym translation and mixed-language topic model methods to select and link related articles between the English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias</a>
