VMWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE
p1
aVSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs

aV\u005cdraftreplace Counts of MWEs automatically structures because classified as regular are shown in Table 1 Table 1 shows the proportions of MWEs classified as regular, and thus further structured
p3
aVTo define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according
