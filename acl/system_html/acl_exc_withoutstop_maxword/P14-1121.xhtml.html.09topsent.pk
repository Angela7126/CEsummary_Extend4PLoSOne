aVWe then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora

aVIn this section, we present experiments to evaluate the influence of comparable corpus size and prediction models on the quality of bilingual terminology extraction
p3
aVIn this section, we first describe the standard approach that deals with the task of bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora
p4
aVWe chose the balanced corpora where the standard approach has shown the best results in the previous experiment, namely [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] and [ diabetes corpus 7 ]
p5
aVSince the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes
