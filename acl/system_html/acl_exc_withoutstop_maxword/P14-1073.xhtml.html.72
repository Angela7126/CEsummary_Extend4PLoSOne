<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We use the discriminative entity clustering algorithm of as our baseline; their approach was found to outperform another generative model which produced a flat clustering of mentions via a Dirichlet process mixture model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We report results using three variations of our model phylo does not consider mention context (all mentions effectively have the same topic) and determines mention entities from a single sample of u'\ud835' u'\udc91' (the last); phylo+topic adds context</a>
