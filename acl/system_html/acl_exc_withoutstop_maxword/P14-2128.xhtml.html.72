<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology the open source MSTParser 1 1 We trained a second order labelled parser with all the configurations set to the default value</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By inspecting the parser outputs, we found that error propagation caused by assigning incorrect head to punctuations is one of the main reason that leads to this result</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Parsing accuracy is evaluated using unlabelled attachment score (UAS), which is the percentage of words that are assigned the correct lexical heads</a>
