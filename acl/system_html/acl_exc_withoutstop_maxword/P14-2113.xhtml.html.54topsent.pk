VGiven that traditional Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [ 15 ] ignore the ordinal relations among sentiment labels, we choose isotonic CRFs [ 16 ] for sentence-level sentiment analysis as they can enforce monotonicity constraints on the parameters consistent with the ordinal structure and domain knowledge (e.g., word-level sentiment conveyed via a lexicon

aVAs the first work that predicts sentence-level sentiment for online discussions, we investigate isotonic Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [ 16 ] for the sentiment-tagging task as they preserve the advantages of the popular CRF-based sequential tagging models [ 15 ] while providing an efficient mechanism for encoding domain knowledge u'\u005cu2014' in our case, a sentiment lexicon u'\u005cu2014' through isotonic constraints on model parameters

aVAs a result, we propose a sentiment analysis approach for online dispute detection that identifies the sequence of sentence-level sentiments (i.e., very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) expressed during the discussion and uses them as features in a classifier that predicts the dispute / non-dispute
