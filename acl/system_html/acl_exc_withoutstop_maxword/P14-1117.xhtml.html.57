<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Furthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] , in which questions of efficiency are paramount due to the larger problems involved; however, these approaches largely restrict compression to pruning parse trees, thereby imposing a dependency on parser performance</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach</a>
