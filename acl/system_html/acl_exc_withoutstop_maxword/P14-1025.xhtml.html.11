<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Such an approach requires knowledge of predominant senses; however, word sense distributions u'\u2014' and predominant senses too u'\u2014' vary from corpus to corpus</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They then predict the most likely sense for each word in the document based on the topic distribution and the words in context ( u'\u201c' corroborators u'\u201d' ), each of which, in turn, depends on the document u'\u2019' s topic distribution</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because of domain differences and the skewed nature of word sense distributions, it is often the case that some senses in a sense inventory will not be attested in a given corpus</a>
