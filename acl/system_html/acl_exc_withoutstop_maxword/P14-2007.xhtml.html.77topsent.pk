VWe wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique
p1
aVThe next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity
p2
aVUsing the idea of u'\u005cu201c' annotation time u'\u005cu201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC
p3
aVHowever, u'\u005cu201c' simple time measurement u'\u005cu201d' is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction
p4
aVAlso, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensemble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences
p5
aVHowever, saccade duration is not significant for annotation of short text, as in our case
p6
aVHowever, because of the sarcasm in the second tweet (in u'\u005cu201c' cold u'\u005cu201d' pizza, an undesirable situation followed by a positive sentiment phrase u'\u005cu201c' just what I wanted u'\u005cu201d' , as discussed in Riloff et al.2013 ), it is more complex than the first for sentiment annotation
p7
aVManual annotation of complexity scores may not be intuitive and reliable
p8
aVThis indicates that
