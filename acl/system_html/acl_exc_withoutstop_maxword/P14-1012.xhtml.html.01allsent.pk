p6
aVZhao et al
p7
aVCompared with the unsupervised DBN features, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective for translation decoder (row 3 vs
p8
aVFirst, the input original features for the DBN feature learning are too simple, the limited 4 phrase features of each phrase pair, such as bidirectional phrase translation probability and bidirectional lexical weighting [ Koehn et al.2003 ] , which are a bottleneck for learning effective feature representation
p9
aVNext, we adapt and extend some original phrase features as the input features for DAE feature learning
p10
aV2012) improved translation quality of n-gram translation model by using a bilingual neural LM, where translation probabilities are estimated using a continuous representation of translation units in lieu of standard discrete representations
p11
aVAdding new DNN features as extra features significantly improves translation accuracy (row 2-17 vs
p12
aVSpecially, Table 4 shows the detailed effectiveness of our introduced input features for DAE feature learning, and the results show that each type of features are very effective for DAE feature learning
p13
aVExcept for the phrase feature X 1 [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , our introduced input features X significantly improve the DAE feature learning (row 11 vs

p15
aV2013) presented a joint language and translation model based on a recurrent neural network which predicts target words based on an unbounded history of both source and target words
p16
aVSection 3 presents our introduced input features for DNN feature learning
p17
aVTo address the first shortcoming, we adapt and extend some simple but effective phrase features as the input features for new DNN feature learning, and these features have been shown significant improvement for SMT, such as, phrase pair similarity [ Zhao et al.2004 ] , phrase frequency, phrase length [ Hopkins and May2011 ] , and phrase generative probability [ Foster et al.2010 ] , which also show further improvement for new phrase feature learning in our experiments
p18
aV2013) went beyond the log-linear model for SMT and proposed a novel additive neural networks based translation model, which overcome some of the shortcomings suffered by the log-linear model linearity and the lack of deep interpretation and representation in features
p19
aVUsing the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence [ Hinton2002 ] , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation
p20
aVKalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) introduced recurrent continuous translation models that comprise a class for purely continuous sentence-level translation models
p21
aV2014) adapted and extended the max-margin based RNN [ Socher et al.2011 ] into HPB translation with force decoding and converting tree, and proposed a RNN based word topology model for HPB translation, which successfully capture the topological structure of the words on the source side in a syntactically and semantically meaningful order
p22
aVDNN features are learned from the non-linear combination of the input original features, they strong capture high-order correlations between the activities of the original features, and we believe this deep learning paradigm induces the original features to further reach their potential for SMT
p23
aVIn the contrast experiments, our DAE and HCDAE features are appended as extra features to the phrase table
p24
aVRecently, many new features have been explored for SMT and significant performance have been obtained in terms of translation quality, such as syntactic features, sparse features, and reordering features
p25
aVCompared with the unsupervised DBN features, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective and stable
p26
aVThen, we append these features for each phrase pair to the phrase table as extra features
p27
aVEach translation rule in the phrase-based translation model has a set number of features that are combined in the log-linear model [ Och and Ney2002 ] , and our semi-supervised DAE features can also be combined in this model
p28
aVAfter the pre-training, for each phrase pair in the phrase table, we generate the DBN features [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] by passing the original phrase features X through the DBN using forward computation
p29
aVAfter the fine-tuning, for each phrase pair in the phrase table, we estimate our DAE features by passing the original phrase features X through the u'\u005cu201c' encoder u'\u005cu201d' part of the DAE using forward computation
p30
aVThis model employ phrase pair similarity to encode the weights of content and non-content words in phrase translation pairs
p31
aVDAE and HCDAE features are learned from the non-linear combination of the original features, they strong capture high-order correlations between the activities of the original features, as to be further interpreted to reach their potential for SMT
p32
aV2004) proposed a way of using term weight based models in a vector space as additional evidences for phrase pair translation quality
p33
aVHCDAE outperforms single DAE for high dimensional feature learning (row 6 vs
p34
aVNow, the input original phrase features X includes 16 features in our experiments, as follows
p35
aVInstead of designing new features based on intuition, linguistic knowledge and domain, for the first time, Maskey and Zhou (2012) explored the possibility of inducing new features in an unsupervised fashion using deep belief net (DBN) [ Hinton et al.2006 ] for hierarchical phrase-based translation model
p36
aVWe suspect these learned features are complementary to the original features
p37
aVFor our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE u'\u005cu2019' s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the u'\u005cu201c' teacher u'\u005cu201d' for semi-supervised back-propagation
p38
aVMoreover, although we have introduced another four types of phrase features ( X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 ), the only 16 features in X are a bottleneck for learning large hidden layers feature representation, because it has limited information, the performance of the high-dimensional DAE features which are directly learned from single DAE is not very satisfactory
p39
aVwhere, the bidirectional forward and backward 1 1 Backward LM has been introduced by Xiong et al
p40
aV2013) presented an ITG reordering classifier based on recursive auto-encoders, and generated vector space representations for variable-sized phrases, which enable predicting orders to exploit syntactic and semantic information
p41
aVWe now test our DAE features on the following two Chinese-English translation tasks
p42
aVTo combine these learned features (DBN and DAE feature) into the log-linear model, we need to eliminate the impact of the non-linear learning mechanism
p43
aVThus, these new m 1 + m 2 -dimensional DAE features are added as extra features to the phrase table
p44
aV16), and further improve the performance of DAE feature learning, which can also somewhat address the bring shortcoming of the limited input features
p45
aVWe use DBN, DAE and HCDAE (with 6 layers u'\u005cu2019' network depth), input features X 1 and X , to learn 2-, 4- and 8-dimensional features, respectively
p46
aVAdding the original features ( X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 ) and DAE/HCDAE features together can further improve translation performance (row 19-23 vs
p47
aVSpecially, Table 3 shows the variance distributions of the learned each dimensional DBN and DAE feature, our DAE features have bigger variance distributions which means our DAE features have more discriminative power, and also their variance distributions are more stable
p48
aVSection 4 describes how to learn our semi-supervised DAE features for SMT
p49
aVInspired by [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we first learn a deep generative model for feature learning using DBN
p50
aVIn this paper, we strive to effectively address the above two shortcomings, and systematically explore the possibility of learning new features using deep (multi-layer) neural networks (DNN, which is usually referred under the name Deep Learning ) for SMT
p51
aVThe phrase-based translation model [ Koehn et al.2003 , Och and Ney2004 ] has demonstrated superior performance and been widely used in current SMT systems, and we employ our implementation on this translation model
p52
aVIn this paper, we systematically explore the possibility of learning new features using DNN for SMT
p53
aVFigure 4 shows our DAE features are not only more effective but also more stable than DBN features with various network structures
p54
aVHowever, none of these above works have focused on learning new features automatically with input data, and while learning suitable features (representations) is the superiority of DNN since it has been proposed
p55
aVX 1 ) not only significantly improves the performance of DAE feature learning, but also slightly improves the performance of DBN feature learning
p56
aVFigure 5 shows there is little change in the performance of using single DAE to learn different dimensional DAE features, but the 4-dimensional features work more better and more stable
p57
aVRecently, there has been growing interest in use of DNN for SMT tasks
p58
aVIt is encouraging that, non-parametric feature expansion using gaussian mixture model (GMM) [ Nguyen et al.2007 ] , which guarantees invariance to the specific embodiment of the original features, has been proved as a feasible feature generation approach for SMT
p59
aVWe normalize bidirectional phrase length by the maximum phrase length, and introduce them as the last type of input features
p60
aVIn this section, we design our DAE network with various network structures for new feature learning
p61
aVTable 2 presents the main translation results
p62
aVAlthough DAE can learn more powerful and abstract feature representation, the learned features usually have smaller dimensionality compared with the dimensionality of the input features, such as the successful use for handwritten digits recognition [ Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006 , Hinton et al.2006 ] , information retrieval [ Salakhutdinov and Hinton2009 , Mirowski et al.2010 ] , and speech spectrograms [ Deng et al.2010 ]
p63
aVThis greedy, layer-by-layer pre-training can be repeated several times to learn a deep, hierarchical model (DBN) in which each layer of features captures strong high-order correlations between the activities of features in the layer below
p64
aVTo address the second shortcoming, inspired by the successful use of DAEs for handwritten digits recognition [ Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006 , Hinton et al.2006 ] , information retrieval [ Salakhutdinov and Hinton2009 , Mirowski et al.2010 ] , and speech spectrograms [ Deng et al.2010 ] , we propose new feature learning using semi-supervised DAE for phrase-based translation model
p65
aVThe baseline translation models are generated by Moses with default parameter settings
p66
aVFollowing [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we use the following 4 phrase features of each phrase pair [ Koehn et al.2003 ] in the phrase table as the first type of input features, bidirectional phrase translation probability ( P ( e f ) and P ( f e ) ), bidirectional lexical weighting ( L e x ( e f ) and L e x ( f e )
p67
aVWe consider bidirectional phrase frequency as the input features, and estimate them as
p68
aVDeep models such as DNN have the potential to be much more representationally efficient for feature learning than shallow models like GMM
p69
aVAlso, adding more input features ( X vs
p70
aVWe adapt and extend bidirectional phrase generative probabilities as the input features, which have been used for domain adaptation [ Foster et al.2010 ]
p71
aVFigures 5 also shows the best network depth for DAE feature learning is 6 layers
p72
aVThus, we have the second type of input features
p73
aVThen, we have the forth type of input features
p74
aVThen, we have the third type of input features
p75
aVFollowing [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , these learned features are normalized by the average of each dimensional respective feature set
p76
aVThus, instead of GMM, we use DNN (DBN, DAE and HCDAE) to learn new non-parametric features, which has the similar evolution in speech recognition [ Dahl et al.2012 , Hinton et al.2012 ]

p79
aVWe build the DAE network where the first layer with visible nodes equaling to 16, and each visible node v i corresponds to the above original features X in each phrase pair
p80
aVMoreover, to learn high dimensional feature representation, we introduce a natural horizontal composition for DAEs (HCDAE) that can be used to create large hidden layer representations simply by horizontally combining two (or more) DAEs [ Baldi2012 ] , which shows further improvement compared with single DAE in our experiments
p81

aVIn summary, except for the first type of phrase feature X 1 which is used by [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we introduce another four types of effective phrase features X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5
p89
aVBy using the input data as the teacher, the u'\u005cu201c' semi-supervised u'\u005cu201d' fine-tuning process of DAE addresses the problem of u'\u005cu201c' back-propagation without a teacher u'\u005cu201d' [ Rumelhart et al.1986 ] , which makes the DAE learn more powerful and abstract features [ Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006 ]
p90
aVTo speed-up the pre-training, we subdivide the entire phrase pairs (with features X ) in the phrase table into small mini-batches, each containing 100 cases, and update the weights after each mini-batch

aVTo learn a semi-supervised DAE, we first u'\u005cu201c' unroll u'\u005cu201d' the above n layer DBN by using its weight matrices to create a deep, 2n-1 layer network whose lower layers use the matrices to u'\u005cu201c' encode u'\u005cu201d' the input and whose upper layers use the matrices in reverse order to u'\u005cu201c' decode u'\u005cu201d' the input [ Hinton and Salakhutdinov2006 , Salakhutdinov and Hinton2009 , Deng et al.2010 ] , as shown in Figure 2
p107
aVThe translation quality is evaluated by case-insensitive IBM BLEU-4 metric
p108
aVTo deal with real-valued input features X in our task, we use an RBM with Gaussian visible units (GRBM) [ Dahl et al.2012 ] with a variance of 1 on each dimension
p109
aVThe layer-wise learning of DBN as above must be treated as a pre-training stage that finds a good region of the parameter space, which is used to initialize our DAE u'\u005cu2019' s parameters
p110
aVThe details of the used network structure in our experiments are shown in Table 1
p111
aVDifferences in m 1 - and m 2 -dimensional hidden representations could be introduced by many different mechanisms (e.g.,, learning algorithms, initializations, training samples, learning rates, or distortion measures) [ Baldi2012 ]
p112
aVAlthough we have pre-trained the corresponding DBN, this DAE network is so deep, the fine-tuning does not work very well and typically finds poor local minima
p113
aVHCDAE outperforms the single DAE and learns high-dimensional representation more effectively, especially for the peak point in each condition
p114
aVThe two conditional distributions can be shown to correspond to the generative model
p115
aVThe LM corpus is the English side of the parallel data (BTEC, CJK and CWMT08 3 3 the 4th China Workshop on Machine Translation ) (1.34M sentences
p116
aVHowever, most of these features are manually designed on linguistic phenomena that are related to bilingual language pairs, thus they are very difficult to devise and estimate
p117
aVThese n RBMs can then be composed to form a DBN in which it is easy to infer the states of the n t u'\u005cu2062' h layer of hidden units from the input in a single forward pass [ Hinton et al.2006 ] , as shown in Figure 1
p118
aVSection 5 describes and discusses the large-scale experimental results
p119
aVDBN is composed of multiple layers of latent variables with the first layer representing the visible feature vectors, which is built with stacked sets of RBMs [ Hinton2002 ]
p120
aVAfter learning the first RBM, we treat the activation probabilities of its hidden units, when they are being driven by data, as the data for training a second RBM
p121
aVIn our task, we introduce differences by using different initializations and different fractions of the phrase table
p122
aVThe weights are updated using a learning rate of 0.1, momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0002 × weight × learning rate
p123
aVEach layer is greedily pre-trained for 50 epochs through the entire phrase pairs
p124
aVSecond, it only uses the unsupervised layer-wise pre-training of DBN built with stacked sets of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) [ Hinton2002 ] , does not have a training objective, so its performance relies on the empirical parameters
p125
aVwhere, p ( e j f i ) and p ( f i e j ) represents bidirectional word translation probability w f i and w e j are term weights for source and target words, w a e j and w a f i are the transformed weights mapped from all source/target words to the target/source dimension at word e j and f i , respectively
p126
aVWe assume that source phrase f = f 1 , u'\u005cu22ef' , f l f and target phrase e = e 1 , u'\u005cu22ef' , e l e include l f and l e words, respectively
p127
aVStarting in this region, the DAE is then fine-tuned using average squared error (between the output and input) back-propagation to minimize reconstruction error, as to make its output as equal as possible to its input
p128
aVFinally, we end with conclusions in section 6
p129
aVThe bilingual corpus is the Chinese-English part of Basic Traveling Expression corpus (BTEC) and China-Japan-Korea (CJK) corpus (0.38M sentence pairs with 3.5/3.8M Chinese/English words
p130
aVWe perform pairwise ranking optimization [ Hopkins and May2011 ] to tune feature weights

p134
aVHowever, the above approach has two major shortcomings
p135
aVTwo single DAEs with architectures 16 / m 1 / 16 and 16 / m 2 / 16 can be trained and the hidden layers can be combined to yield an expanded hidden feature representation of size m 1 + m 2 , which can then be fed to the subsequent layers of the overall architecture
p136
aVOur development set is IWSLT 2005 test set (506 sentences), and our test set is IWSLT 2007 test set (489 sentences
p137
aVThus, this approach is unstable and the improvement is limited

p146
aVThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows
p147
aVFor the fine-tuning of DAE, we use the method of conjugate gradients on larger mini-batches of 1000 cases, with three line searches performed for each mini-batch in each epoch
p148
aVOur results are fairly robust to variations in these parameters
p149
aVThe precise weights found by the pre-training do not matter as long as it finds a good region of the parameter space from which to start the fine-tuning
p150
aVwhere, the c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' ( f ) / c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) are the total number of phrase f/e appearing in the source/target side of the bilingual corpus, and the denominator are the total number of the phrases whose length are equal to f
p151
aVHence, P ( v h ) and E u'\u005cu2062' ( v , h ) in the first RBM of DBN need to be modified as

aVFrom the results, we can get some clear trends

aVThe 4-gram LMs are estimated by the SRILM toolkit with modified Kneser-Ney discounting
