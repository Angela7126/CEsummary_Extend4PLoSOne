<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Considering the fact that the abstract sentences are automatically generated and the original sentences are human-written, the grammaticality score and the percentage of fully grammatical sentences generated by our system, with higher ROUGE or quality scores in comparison with other methods, demonstrates that our system is an effective phrasal query abstraction framework for both spoken and written conversations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is because traditional NLP approaches developed for formal texts often are not satisfactory when dealing with multiparty written conversations, which are typically in a casual style and do not display a clear syntactic structure with proper grammar and spelling</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To address such limitations, we propose a fully automatic unsupervised abstract generation framework based on phrasal queries for multimodal conversation summarization</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Extractive our full query-based abstractive summariztion system show statistically significant improvements over baselines and other pure extractive summarization systems for ROUGE-1 4 4 The statistical significance tests was calculated by approximate randomization, as described in [ 31 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For manual evaluation of query-based abstracts (meeting and email datasets), we perform a simple user study assessing the following aspects i) Overall quality given a query (5-point scale)?; and ii) Responsiveness how responsive is the generated summary to the query (5-point scale</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Automatic evaluation on the chat dataset and manual evaluation over the meetings and emails show that our system uniformly and statistically significantly outperforms baseline systems, as well as a state-of-the-art query-based extractive summarization system</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using entailment in this phase is motivated by taking advantage of semantic relations instead of pure statistical methods (e.g.,, Maximal Marginal Relevance) and shown to be more effective [ 19 ]</a>
