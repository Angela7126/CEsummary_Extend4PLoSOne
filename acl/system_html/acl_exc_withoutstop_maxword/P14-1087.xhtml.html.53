<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Referring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The importance of a time span T u'\u2062' S i is computed by normalizing the number of events in T u'\u2062' S i against the number of events in T u'\u2062' S L</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Two events are said to be in the same time span if one happens within the time period the other happens in</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Formally, if a sentence s contains events u'\ud835' u'\udd3c' s = { e 1 , u'\u2026' , e n } , where each event is associated with a time span T u'\u2062' S i , then T u'\u2062' C u'\u2062' D is computed using</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u2062' S c</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>By doing so, we are able to make better use of the available temporal information, taking into account all known events and the time in which they occur</a>
