VIn this generic task, some of the best reported results were obtained by a system [] which computed importance scores for words in the input by examining if the word occurs with significantly higher probability in the input compared to a large background collection of news articles
p1
aVFor illustration, assume that a user u'\u005cu2019' s background knowledge comprises of multiple hypotheses about the current state of the world and a probability distribution over these hypotheses indicates his degree of belief in each hypothesis
p2
aVWe use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) update summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set
p3
aVCentral to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in
