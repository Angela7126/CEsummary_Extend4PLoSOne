<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For each evaluation setting we provide two sets of scores u'\u2014' first are the 1-1 and V-m scores for the given model, second are the comparable scores for K-means run with the same number of clusters as induced by the non-parametric model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With different number of induced and gold standard clusters the 1-1 measure suffers because some induced clusters cannot be mapped to gold clusters or vice versa</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Exponentiating the prior reduces the number of induced clusters and improves results, as it can change the cluster assignment for some words where the likelihood strongly prefers one cluster but the prior clearly indicates another</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In contrast, we use pairwise morphological similarity as a prior in a non-parametric clustering model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These results show that all non-parametric models perform better than K-means, which is a strong baseline</a>
