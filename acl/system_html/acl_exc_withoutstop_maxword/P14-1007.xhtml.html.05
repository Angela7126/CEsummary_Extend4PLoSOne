<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Both systems map from logical forms with explicit representations of scope of negation out to string-based annotations in the format provided by the Shared Task gold standard</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The main points of difference are in the robustness of the system and in the degree of tailoring of both the rules for determining scope on the logical form level and the rules for handling semantically vacuous elements</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our vacuous word handling rules use the syntactic structure provided by the ERG as scaffolding to help link the scope information gleaned from contentful words to vacuous words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Though the task-specific concept of scope of negation is not the same as the notion of quantifier and operator scope in mainstream underspecified semantics, we nonetheless find that reviewing the 2012 * SEM Shared Task annotations with reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure suggests a simple and straightforward operationalization of their concept of negation scope</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The system description in \citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 suggests relatively little tailoring at either level aside from adjustments to the Boxer lexicon to make more negation cues take the form of the negation operator in the DRS, the notion of scope is directly that given in the DRS</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, the string-based annotations also include words which the ERG treats as semantically vacuous</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus</a>
