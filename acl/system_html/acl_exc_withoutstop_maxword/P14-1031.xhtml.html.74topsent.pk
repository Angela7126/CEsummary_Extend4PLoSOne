VSpecifically, we construct the lexical constraints by extracting sentiment-bearing patterns within sentences and construct the discourse-level constraints by extracting discourse relations that indicate sentiment coherence or sentiment changes both within and across sentences
p1
aVSpecifically, we use the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model as the learner for sentence-level sentiment classification, and incorporate rich discourse and lexical knowledge as soft constraints into the learning of CRF parameters via Posterior Regularization (PR) [ 7 ]

aVIn this paper, we propose a sentence-level sentiment classification method that can (1) incorporate rich discourse information at both local and global levels; (2) encode discourse knowledge as soft constraints during learning; (3) make use of unlabeled data to enhance learning
p3
aVWe can incorporate the proposed constraints (constraints derived from lexical patterns and discourse connectives) as hard constraints into CRF during inference by manually setting u'\u005cu039b' in equation 4 to a large value, 9 9 We set u'\u005cu039b' to 1000 for the
