VOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p1
aVFor example, a certain preposition attached to a token in the source language might map into a morphological tag in the target language, which would be hard to handle for traditional direct model transfer other than using some kind of refinement procedure involving parallel data
p2
aVWe did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their
