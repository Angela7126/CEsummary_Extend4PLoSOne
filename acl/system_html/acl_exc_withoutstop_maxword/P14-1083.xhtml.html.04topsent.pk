VLexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning
p1
aVComputer assisted translation (CAT) subsumes several modes of interaction, ranging from binary feedback on the quality of the system prediction [ Saluja et al.2012 ] , to human post-editing operations on a system prediction resulting in a reference translation [ Cesa-Bianchi et al.2008 ] , to human acceptance or overriding of sentence completion predictions [ Langlais et al.2000 , Barrachina et al.2008 , Koehn and Haddow2009 ]

aVTable 4 shows examples where the translation predicted by response-based learning ( Rebol ) differs from the gold standard reference translation, but yet leads to positive feedback via a parse that returns the correct answer from the database
p3
aVPositive feedback means that the correct answer is received, i.e.,, exec u'\u005cu2062' ( p g ) exec u'\u005cu2062' ( p h ) indicates that the
