VIn addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types
p1
aVOur work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context
p2
aVWhile most verbs have one predominant interpretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative ( 1 ) or dynamic ( 1 ) depending on the context
p3
aVWe aim to leverage existing, possibly noisy sets of representative stative, dynamic or mixed verb types extracted from LCS (see section 3 ), making up for unseen verbs and noise by averaging over distributional similarities
p4
aVIn contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs
p5
aVFor verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that
p6
aVWe also include features that indicate, if there are
