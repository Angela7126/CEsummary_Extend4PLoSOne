VWhat is the effect of including the proposed measure of syntactic complexity in the state-of-the-art automatic scoring model
p1
aVThe effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency
p2
aVSubsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score
p3
aVIn addition, including our proposed measure of syntactic complexity in an automatic scoring model results in a statistically significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art
p4
aVHere we outline the multiple stages involved in the automatic syntactic complexity assessment
p5
aVThe various objective measures are then combined in the multiple regression scoring model to generate an overall score of proficiency
p6
aVThe focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems
p7
