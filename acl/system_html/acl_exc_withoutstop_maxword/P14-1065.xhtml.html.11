<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As an example, consider the three discourse trees (DTs) shown in Figure 4 a ) for a reference (human) translation, and ( b ) and ( c ) for translations of two different systems on the WMT12 test dataset</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, rather than proposing yet another MT evaluation metric, we show that discourse information is complementary to many existing evaluation metrics, and thus should not be ignored</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, at WMT12, 12 metrics were compared [] , most of them new</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To do so, we contrast different MT evaluation metrics with and without discourse information</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These metrics tasks are based on sentence-level evaluation, which arguably can limit the benefits of using global discourse properties</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Compared to the previous work, ( i ) we use a different discourse representation (RST), ( ii ) we compare discourse parses using all-subtree kernels [] , ( iii ) we evaluate on much larger datasets, for several language pairs and for multiple metrics, and ( iv ) we do demonstrate better correlation with human judgments</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As in the WMT12 experimental setup, we use these rankings to calculate correlation with human judgments at the sentence-level, i.e., Kendall u'\u2019' s Tau; see [] for details</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Fortunately, several sentences are long and complex enough to present rich discourse structures connecting their basic clauses</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As shown in Figure 7 , DR does not include any lexical item, and therefore measures the similarity between two</a>
