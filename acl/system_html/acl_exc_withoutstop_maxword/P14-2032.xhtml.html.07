<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This method is called dual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also give an updated Viterbi decoding algorithm for CRF and a modified beam-search algorithm for perceptron in Algorithm 2.2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Similar to previous work [ 13 ] , we solve this DD problem by iteratively updating the sub-gradient as depicted in Algorithm 2.2</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where</a>
