<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Similarly, for a candidate sense change from t u'\u2062' v i to t u'\u2062' v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t u'\u2062' v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t u'\u2062' v i with any time interval t u'\u2062' v k , intermediate between t u'\u2062' v i and t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If a word undergoes a sense change, this can be detected by comparing its senses obtained from two different time periods</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In Section 4 we present an approach based on graph clustering to identify the time-varying sense clusters and in Section 5 we present the split-merge based approach for tracking word sense changes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Remarkably, comparison with the English WordNet indicates that in 44% cases, as identified by our algorithm, there has been a birth of a completely novel sense, in 46% cases a new sense has split off from an older sense and in 43% cases two or more older senses have merged in to form a new sense</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Toward this objective we make the following contributions a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate the performance of the algorithms on various datasets using different suitable approaches along with a detailed error analysis</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since we can not expect a perfect split, birth etc., we used certain threshold values to detect if a candidate word is undergoing sense change via one of these four cases</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Since it was difficult to go through all the candidate sense changes for all the comparisons manually, we decided to randomly select some candidate words, which were flagged by our algorithm as</a>
