VThe bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilingual corpora was initially addressed by using parallel corpora (i.e., a corpus that contains source texts and their translation
p1
aVThe bilingual lexicon extraction task from comparable corpora inherits this filiation
p2
aVAccording to Fung and Cheung (2004) , who range bilingual corpora from parallel corpora to quasi-comparable corpora going through comparable corpora, there is a continuum from parallel to comparable corpora (i.e., a kind of filiation

aVWe then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced corpora

aV21) observe, a specialized comparable corpus is built as balanced by analogy with a parallel corpus u'\u005cu201c' Therefore, in relation to parallel corpora, it is more likely for comparable corpora to be designed as general balanced corpora u'\u005cu201d'

aVSince the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes
