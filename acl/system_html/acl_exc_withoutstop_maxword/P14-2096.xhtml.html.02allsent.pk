VThe first sentence of this article is u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games is a 2008 young adult novel by American writer Suzanne Collins u'\u005cu201d' Since article titles may be named entities or compound nouns, the dependency parser may mislabel them and thus output an incorrect parse tree
p1
aVIn this paper, we propose a method comprising title and hypernym translation and mixed-language topic model methods to select and link related articles between the English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias
p2
aVIn order to evaluate the performance of cross-language article linking between English Wikiepdia and Chinese Baidu Baike, we compile an English-Chinese evaluation dataset from Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias
p3
aVIn order to generate the gold standard evaluation sets of correct English and Chinese article pairs, we automatically collect English-Chinese inter-language links from Wikipedia
p4
aVThe second stage of our approach is to score each viable candidate using a supervised learning method, and then sort all candidates in order of score from high to low as final output
p5
aVFor each English article queries, ten output Baidu Baike candidates are generated in a ranked list
p6
aVFor example, the previous sentence is rewritten as u'\u005cu201c' It is a 2008 young adult novel by American writer Suzanne Collins u'\u005cu201d' Then, the dependency parser generates the following parse tree
p7
aVSince alternative encyclopedias like Baidu Baike are larger (by article count) and growing faster than the Chinese Wikipedia, it is worth-while to investigate creating cross-language links among different online encyclopedias
p8
aVIn our title matching method, we formulate candidate selection as an English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) problem [ 8 ] , in which every English article‚Äôs title is treated as a query and all the articles in the Chinese encyclopedia are treated as the documents
p9
aVIn the results, we can observe that mix-language topic model, hypernym, and English title occurence features all noticeably improve the performance
p10
aVIn this study, we only carry out title hypernym extraction on the first sentences of English articles due to the looser syntactic structure of Chinese
p11
aVSince the two encyclopedias u'\u005cu2019' article formats differ, we copy the information in each article (title, content, category, etc.) into a standardized XML structure
p12
aVThe title of the correct Chinese article is the full name of the Roman Emperor Nero (Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus
p13
aVSuch length differences may cause the SVM model to rank the correct answer lower when the difference of other features are not so significant because the contents of the Chinese candidates are similar
p14
aVIn order to show the benefits of each feature used in the SVM model, we conduct a experiment to test the performance of different feature combinations
p15
aVTo train the LDA model, the pair English and Chinese articles are concatenated into a single document
p16
aVIn query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia
p17
aVThe similarity values generated by title matching and title similarity are used directly as real value features in the SVM model
p18
aVOur approach to cross-language article linking comprises two stages candidate selection, which produces a list of candidate articles, and candidate ranking, which ranks that list
p19
aVFor the query- and document-translation steps, we use the Lucene search engine with similarity scores calculated by the Okapi BM25 ranking function [ 2 ]
p20
aVIn document translation, we translate the contents of the entire Chinese encyclopedia into English and then search them using the original English titles
p21
aVFirst, our spider crawls the entire contents of English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike
p22
aVThen, for each English article and Chinese candidate pair in testing, the LDA model provides the distribution of the latent topics
p23
aVTo generate dependency parse trees for the sentences, we adopt the Stanford Dependency Parser
p24
aVWe select the top 500 English-Chinese article pairs with the highest page view counts in Baidu Baike
p25
aVThe first kind of error is due to large literal differences between the English and Chinese titles
p26
aVIn the title similarity method, every Chinese article title is represented as a vector, and each distinct character in all these titles is a dimension of all vectors
p27
aVFor example, the first sentence of the u'\u005cu201c' iPad u'\u005cu201d' article in the English Wikipedia begins, u'\u005cu201c' iPad is a line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc u'\u005cu2026' u'\u005cu201d' In this sentence, the term u'\u005cu201c' tablet computers u'\u005cu201d' is the hypernym of iPad
p28
aVWe separate all words in the translated and original English article titles with the u'\u005cu201c' OR u'\u005cu201d' operator before submission to the search engine
p29
aVSeveral works have focused on creating cross-language links between Wikipedia language versions [ 7 , 9 ] or finding a cross-language link for each entity mention in a Wikipedia article, namely Cross-Language Link Discovery (CLLD) [ 10 , 5 ]
p30
aVTo evaluate the performance of our method on linking different types of encyclopedia articles, we compile a set containing the most popular articles
p31
aVWe use the results of title matching and title similarity from the candidate selection stage as two features for the candidate ranking stage
p32
aVWe regard the appearance of the English title in the first sentence of a Baidu Baike article as a binary feature
p33
aVWe employ the two main CLIR methods query translation and document translation
p34
aVBecause of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article u'\u005cu201c' Nero u'\u005cu201d' and the corresponding Chinese article is low
p35
aVEnglish and Chinese terms are all regarded as terms of the same language and the LDA topic model, namely mixed-language topic model, generates both English and Chinese terms for each latent topic
p36
aVSimilarly, in Korea, Naver Knowledge Encyclopedia has a large presence
p37
aVBecause title similarity of the articles is a widely used method, we choose English and Chinese title similarity as the baseline
p38
aVThen, we manually designed seven patterns to extract hypernyms from the parse tree structures
p39
aVTitle translation is an effective and widely used method of creating cross-language links between encyclopedia articles
p40
aVAlthough our method can effectively generate cross-language links with high accuracy, some correct candidates are not ranked number one
p41
aVThe entropy of the estimated topic distribution of a related article is expected to be lower than that of an unrelated article
p42
aVTo extract possible candidates, two similarity calculation methods are carried out title matching and title similarity
p43
aVThese works were able to exploit the link structure and metadata common to all Wikipedia language versions
p44
aVTable 1 shows the statistics of inter-language link pages in the English and Chinese editions in February 2014
p45
aVAn MRR closer to 1 implies that the correct answer usually appears close to the top of the n-best lists
p46
aVEnglish title occurrence u'\u005cu2020' This config outperforms the best config in last level with statistically significant difference
p47
aVTraditional MRR measures any correct answer produced by the system from among the candidates
p48
aVBecause our approach uses an SVM model, the data set should be split into training and test sets
p49
aVBecause the number of all possible words is too large, we adopt a topic model to gather the words into some latent topics
p50
aVEach topic is represented by a distribution of words, and each word has a probability score used to measure its contribution to the topic
p51
aVFor example, for the English article u'\u005cu201c' Jensen Ackles u'\u005cu201d' , our approach generates a link to the Chinese article u'\u005cu201c' Jensen u'\u005cu201d' in Baidu Baike
p52
aV[ 4 ] If any pattern matches the structure of the dependency parse tree, the hypernym can be extracted
p53
aVTo avoid brute-force comparison, we first select plausible candidate articles on which to focus our efforts
p54
aVWe also compile a suitable dataset from the above two encyclopedias to evaluate the linking accuracy of our method
p55
aVThese results show that our method is very effective in linking articles in English Wikipedia to those in Baidu Baike
p56
aVLDA can be seen as a typical probabilistic approach to latent topic computation
p57
aVTable 2 shows the final results of different feature combinations
p58
aVOnline encyclopedias are among the most frequently used Internet services today u'\u005cu2020' u'\u005cu2020' * corresponding author One of the largest and best known online encyclopedias is Wikipedia
p59
aVThe two semantically corresponding articles often have many related terms, which results in clusters of specific words
p60
aVIf so, the corresponding English Wikipedia article and the Baidu Baike article are paired in the gold standard
p61
aVIn China, for example Baidu Baike and Hudong are the largest encyclopedia sites, containing more than 6.2 and 7 million Chinese articles respectively
p62
aVRecall is used to measure the performance of the candidate selection method
p63
aVFor statistical generality, each data set is randomly split 4:1 (training:test) 30 times
p64
aVNext, we apply our predefined syntactic patterns to extract the hypernym
p65
aVSince knowledge bases (KB) may contain millions of articles, comparison between all possible pairs in two knowledge bases is time-consuming and sometimes impractical
p66
aVIf the candidate selection method can actually select the correct Chinese candidate, the recall will be high
p67
aVIn a Baidu Baike article, the first sentence may contain a parenthetical translation of the main title
p68
aVThe second error type is caused by articles that have duplicates in Baidu Baike
p69
aV* 1 MTM mix-language topic model * 2 HT hypernym translation * 3 ETO
p70
aVThen, cosine similarity between this vector and the vector of each Chinese title is measured as title similarity
p71
aVFor pairs that have both English and Chinese articles, the Chinese article title is regarded as the translation of the English one
p72
aVThe title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector
p73
aVThis set represents the articles people in China are most interested in
p74
aVWe use the support vector machine (SVM) approach to determine the probability of each pair ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' i , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' j ) being equivalent
p75
aVIn this pattern, the rightmost leaf is the hypernym target
p76
aVACC measures the correctness of the first candidate in the candidate list
p77
aVRecall is the fraction of the retrieved articles that are relevant to the given query
p78
aVTo avoid this problem, we first replace all instances of an article u'\u005cu2019' s title in the first sentence with pronouns
p79
aV1/MRR approximates the average rank of the correct transliteration
p80
aVFor a linked English-Chinese article pair, the distribution of words used in each usually shows some convergence
p81
aVWikipedia has many language versions, and articles in one language contain hyperlinks to corresponding pages in other languages
p82
aVThe false positive u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶ÑÁéã u'\u005cu201d' is a historical novel about the life of the Emperor Nero
p83
aV[ 6 ] Thus, the distribution of terms is good measurement of article similarity
p84
aVThe final evaluation results are calculated as the mean of the average of these 30 evaluation sets
p85
aVAfter extracting the hypernym of the English article, the hypernym is translated into Chinese
p86
aVThese two articles both describe the actor Jensen Ackles
p87
aVFor example, for the English article u'\u005cu201c' Nero u'\u005cu201d' , our approach ranks the Chinese candidate u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶ÑÁéã u'\u005cu201d' ( u'\u005cu201c' King Nero u'\u005cu201d' ) as number one, instead of the correct answer u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶Ñ¬∑ÂÖãÂä≥ÁãÑ‰πåÊñØ¬∑Âæ∑È≤ÅËãèÊñØ¬∑Êó•ËÄ≥ÊõºÂ∞ºÂ∫ìÊñØ u'\u005cu201d' (the number two candidate
p88
aVHowever, when linking between different online encyclopedia platforms this is more difficult as many of these structural features are different or not shared
p89
aVThese extracted hypernyms can be treated as article categories
p90
aVIn this case, our approach still generates a correct link, although it is not the one in the gold standard
p91
aVEquivalent articles are articles that describe the same topic in different languages
p92
aVOther methods must be used along with title translation to create a more robust linking tool
p93
aVFor this feature, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ]
p94
aVAfter examining the results, we can divide errors into several categories
p95
aVThe term u'\u005cu201c' novel u'\u005cu201d' is the extracted hypernym of the English article u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games u'\u005cu201d'
p96
aVCombining two of these three feature has more improvement and the combination of all the features achieves the best
p97
aVThe total number of Chinese articles is about one-quarter of English ones, and only 2.3% of English articles have inter-language links to their Chinese versions
p98
aVThe third error type is translation errors
p99
aVTo measure the quality of cross-language entity linking, we use the following three metrics
p100
aVFor example, the English article u'\u005cu201c' Raccoon u'\u005cu201d' is linked to the Baidu article u'\u005cu201c' Áã∏ u'\u005cu201d' (raccoon dog), though the correct one is ‚ÄúÊµ£ÁÜä‚Äù (raccoon
p101
aVIf two articles do not describe the same topic, the distribution of terms is often scattered
p102
aVTo demonstrate this idea, let us take the English article u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games u'\u005cu201d' for example
p103
aVNext, we check if there is a Chinese article in Baidu Baike with exactly the same title as the one in Chinese Wikipedia
p104
aVThe top predicted corresponding article y j in the knowledge base K 2 for an input article x i in K 1 should receive a higher score than any other entity in K 2 , a m u'\u005cu2208' K 2 , m u'\u005cu2260' j
p105
aVNext, we can use entropy to measure the distribution of topics
p106
aVWe can calculate the entropy of the distribution as a value for SVM
p107
aVFigure 1 shows the top- k ACC from the top 1 to 5
p108
aVThe overall results of our method achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46% in recall
p109
aVA u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' C = 1 means that all top candidates are correctly linked (i.e.,†they match one of the references), and A u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' C = 0 means that none of the top candidates is correct
p110
aVThen, individual feature functions F k u'\u005cu2062' ( x i , y j ) are based on the feature properties of both article a i and a j
p111
aVTo date, little research has been done into linking between encyclopedias on different platforms
p112
aVTo define the metrics, we use following notations
p113
aVIn some cases, for example, the titles of corresponding articles in different languages do not even match
p114
aVThen, another feature is added to each configuration until all the features have been added
p115
aVThe value of this feature in the SVM model is calculated as follows
p116
aVFor all E-C and C-E translation tasks, we use Google Translate
p117
aVHowever, the coverage of different language ver-sions of Wikipedia is very inconsistent
p118
aVThe top 100 results for the query-translation and the top 100 results for document-translation steps are unionized
p119
aVN is the number of English query; r i , j is j -th correct Chinese article for i -th English query; c i , k is k -th candiate the system output for i -th English query
p120
aVFor example, the first sentence of the Chinese article on San Francisco is u'\u005cu201c' ÊóßÈáëÂ±±ÔºàSan FranciscoÔºâÔºåÂèàËØë‚ÄòÂú£ÂºóÊúóË•øÊñØÁßë‚Äô„ÄÅ‚Äò‰∏âËó©Â∏Ç‚Äô„ÄÇ u'\u005cu201d'
p121
aVGiven two encyclopedia K 1 and K 2 , cross-language article linking is the task of finding the corresponding equivalent article a j from encyclopedia K 2 for each article a i from encyclopedia K 1
p122
aVwhere T is the number of latent topics, u'\u005cu0398' d u'\u005cu2062' j is the topic distribution of a given topic j
p123
aVCross-language article linking between different encyclopedias can be formulated as follows
p124
aVThe resulting list contains our title-matching candidates
p125
aVIt may also contain a hypernym that defines the category of the article
p126
aVThe first sentence of an encyclopedia article usually contains the title of the article
p127
aVHowever, there are alternatives to Wikipedia for some languages
p128
aVThe entropy is defined as follows
p129
aVThe reason is that Google Translate provides the translation u'\u005cu201c' Áã∏ u'\u005cu201d' instead of u'\u005cu201c' Êµ£ÁÜä u'\u005cu201d'
p130
aVIf the English title appears in the first sentence, the value of this feature is 1; otherwise, the value is 0
p131
aVArticle linking can then be defined as follows
p132
aVTherefore, articles containing the same hypernym are likely to belong to the same category
p133
aVThus, we can extract the hypernym u'\u005cu201c' novel u'\u005cu201d' from the previous example
p134
aVIn the above example, the following pattern is matched
p135
aVHowever, there is another Baidu article u'\u005cu201c' Ë©πÊ£Æ¬∑ÈòøÂÖãÊñØ u'\u005cu201d' ( u'\u005cu201c' Jensen Ackles u'\u005cu201d'
p136
aVOur SVM model u'\u005cu2019' s features are described below
p137
aVFor each encyclopedia K , a collection of human-written articles, can be defined as K = { a i } i = 1 n , where a i is an article in K and n is the size of K
p138
aV[ 11 , 1 ] However, title translation alone is not always sufficient
p139
aVEach article x i in KB K 1 can be represented by a feature vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' i = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) , f 2 u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f n u'\u005cu2062' ( x i )
p140
aVwhere h is the hypernym, t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( h ) is the Chinese translation of the term h
p141
aVAlso, we have u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' j = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) , f 2 u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f n u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) ) for a candidate article y j in KB K 2
