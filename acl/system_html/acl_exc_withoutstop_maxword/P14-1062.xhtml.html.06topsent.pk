VIn the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network
p1
aVWe model sentences using a convolutional architecture that alternates wide convolutional layers with dynamic pooling layers given by dynamic k -max pooling
p2
aVMultiple layers of convolutional and dynamic pooling operations induce a structured feature graph over the input sentence
p3
aVBy adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []
p4
aVWe next describe a pooling operation that is a generalisation of the max pooling over the time dimension used in the Max-TDNN sentence model and different from the local max pooling operations applied in a convolutional network for object recognition []
