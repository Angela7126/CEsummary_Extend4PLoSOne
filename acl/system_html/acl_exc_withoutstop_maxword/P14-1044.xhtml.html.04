<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The original PageRank ( pr ) algorithm [ 3 ] computes, for a given graph, a single vector wherein each node is associated with a weight denoting its structural importance in that graph ppr is a variation of pr where the computation is biased towards a set of initial nodes in order to capture the notion of importance with respect to those particular nodes ppr has been previously used in a wide variety of tasks such as definition similarity-based resource alignment [ 27 ] , textual semantic similarity [ 14 , 30 ] , Word Sense Disambiguation [ 1 , 6 ] and semantic text categorization [ 24 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Instead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures</a>
