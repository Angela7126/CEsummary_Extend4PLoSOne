<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym pairs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The combination strategy is to simply merge all positive results from the two methods together, and then to infer new relations based on the transitivity of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
