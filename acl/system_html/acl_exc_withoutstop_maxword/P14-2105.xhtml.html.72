<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In order to provide a fair comparison to previous work, we experimented with our approach using the Paralax dataset [ 7 ] , which consists of paraphrases of questions mined from WikiAnswers and answer triples from ReVerb</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our approach in this work can be viewed as a simple semantic parser tailored to single-relation questions, powered by advanced semantic similarity models to handle the paraphrase issue</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By applying simple seed templates to the KB and by leveraging community-authored paraphrases of questions from WikiAnswers, they successfully demonstrated a high-quality lexicon of pattern-matching rules can be learned for this restricted form of semantic parsing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this section, we briefly introduce the dataset, describe the system training and evaluation processes and, finally, present our experimental results</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Word hashing not only makes the learning more scalable by controlling the size of the vocabulary, but also can effectively handle the OOV issues, sometimes due to spelling</a>
