<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As indicated in the above section, we restrict the set of undirected trees to be those such that after applying h dir the resulting t is projective i.e., there are no crossing brackets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Generating a bracketing via an undirected tree enables us to build on existing methods for structure learning of latent-tree graphical models [ Choi et al.2011 , Anandkumar et al.2011 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This undirected tree is converted into a directed tree by applying h dir</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies [ Choi et al.2011 , Song et al.2011 ,</a>
