<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this model, we assume that each tweet message m u'\u2208' { 1 u'\u2062' M } is assigned to one event instance e , while e is modeled as a joint distribution over the named entities y , the date/time d when the event occurred, the location l where the event occurred and the event-related keywords k</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As illustrated in Figure 1 , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can treat an event as a latent variable and model the generation of an event as a joint distribution of its individual event elements</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled</a>
