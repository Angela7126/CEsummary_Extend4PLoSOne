VBy using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set
p1
aVIn order to provide a fair comparison to previous work, we experimented with our approach using the Paralax dataset [ 7 ] , which consists of paraphrases of questions mined from WikiAnswers and answer triples from ReVerb
p2
aVOur approach in this work can be viewed as a simple semantic parser tailored to single-relation questions, powered by advanced semantic similarity models to handle the paraphrase issue
p3
aVBy applying simple seed templates to the KB and by leveraging community-authored paraphrases of questions from WikiAnswers, they successfully demonstrated a high-quality lexicon of pattern-matching rules can be learned for this restricted form of semantic parsing
p4
aVIn this section, we briefly introduce the dataset, describe the system training and evaluation processes and, finally, present our experimental results
p5
aVWord hashing not only makes the learning more scalable by controlling the size of the vocabulary, but also can effectively handle the OOV issues, sometimes due to spelling
