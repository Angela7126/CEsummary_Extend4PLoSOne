<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In conclusion, the main contribution of this paper is a novel approach for semantic parsing based on a simple generation procedure and a paraphrase model</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Once the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>First, the paraphrase model is decoupled from the KB, so we can train it from large text corpora</a>
