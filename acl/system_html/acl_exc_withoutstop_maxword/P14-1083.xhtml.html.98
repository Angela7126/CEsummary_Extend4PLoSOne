<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Lexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Table 5 shows examples where translations from Rebol and Rampion differ from the gold standard reference, and predictions by Rebol lead to positive feedback, while predictions by Rampion lead to negative feedback</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Rebol u'\u2019' s combination of task feedback with a cost function achieves the best results since positively executable hypotheses and reference translations can both be exploited to guide the learning process</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The examples show structural and lexical variation that leads to differences on the string level at equivalent positive feedback from the extrinsic task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In addition, we can use translation-specific cost functions based on sentence-level BLEU in order to boost similarity of translations to human reference translations</a>
