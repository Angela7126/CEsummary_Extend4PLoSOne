VStarting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse
p1
aVThe Effect of Constraints in Learning Our training method updates parameters to satisfy the pairwise constraints between (1) subsequent samples on the sampling path and (2) selected samples and the ground truth
p2
aVWe split the sentence based on the ending punctuation, predict the parse tree for each segment and group the roots of resulting trees into a single node
p3
aVThis research is developed in collaboration with the Arabic Language Technologies (ALT) group at Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) within the Iyas project
p4
aVAs a result, the selected tag is influenced by a broad syntactic context above and beyond the initial tagging model and is directly optimized
