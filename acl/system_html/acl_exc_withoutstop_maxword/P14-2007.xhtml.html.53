<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Also, in terms of an automatic SA engine which has multiple classifiers in its ensemble, a classifier may be chosen based on the complexity of sentiment annotation (for example, use a rule-based classifier for simple sentences and a more complex classifier for other sentences</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, u'\u201c' simple time measurement u'\u201d' is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction</a>
