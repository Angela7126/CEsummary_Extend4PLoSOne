<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u201c' design freedom u'\u201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The linear tensor model is illustrated in Figure 1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So what is the advantage of learning with a tensor model instead of a vector model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Specifically, a vector is a 1 st order tensor, a matrix is a 2 nd order tensor, and data organized as a rectangular cuboid is a 3 rd order tensor etc</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However if we use a 2 nd order tensor model, organize the features into a 1000 1000 matrix u'\ud835' u'\udebd' , and use just one rank-1 matrix to approximate the weight tensor, then the linear model becomes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most traditional models are linear models, in the sense that both the features of the data and model parameters are represented as vectors in a vector space</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Specifically, a vector space model assumes each feature weight to be a u'\u201c' free u'\u201d' parameter, and estimating them reliably could therefore be hard when training data are not</a>
