<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>CoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Another important similarity measure is cosine similarity of Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The disadvantage of this similarity measure is significant and even more visible on bilingual lexicon extraction than on synonym extraction (see Table 2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Apart from SimRank, extensions of PageRank are the main methods for computing the similarity of nodes in graphs in NLP (e.g.,, Hughes and Ramage ( 2007 ) , Agirre et al</a>
