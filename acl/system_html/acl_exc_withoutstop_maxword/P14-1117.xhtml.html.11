<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Furthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] , in which questions of efficiency are paramount due to the larger problems involved; however, these approaches largely restrict compression to pruning parse trees, thereby imposing a dependency on parser performance</a>
