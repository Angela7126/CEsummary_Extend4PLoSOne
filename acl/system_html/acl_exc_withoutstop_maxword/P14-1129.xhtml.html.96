<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If t i is unaligned, we inherit its affiliation from the closest aligned word, with preference given to the right</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For unaligned words, the normal heuristic can also be used, except when the word is on the edge of a rule, because then the target neighbor words are not necessarily known</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To do this, we first say that each target word t i is affiliated with exactly one source word at index a i u'\ud835' u'\udcae' i is then the m -word source window centered at a i</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Specifically, if unaligned target word t is on the right edge of an arc that covers source span [ s i , s j ] , we simply say that t is affiliated with source word</a>
