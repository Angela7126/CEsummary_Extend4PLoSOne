VIn this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words
p1
aVAs in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents
p2
aV[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents
p3
aVWe then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents
p4
aVIf the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels
p5
aVThe basic idea involves encoding of class labels as artificial words which are u'\u005cu201c' sprinkled u'\u005cu201d' (appended) to training documents
p6
aVAs the most probable words of topics are representative of the dataset, there is no need for the annotator to search for the right set of features for each class
p7
aVAs LDA uses higher order word associations [] while discovering topics, we hypothesize that sprinkling will improve text classification performance of ClassifyLDA
p8
aVWe then ask a human annotator to assign one or more class labels to the topics based on their most probable words
p9
aVIn this paper, we propose a text classification algorithm based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [] which does not need labeled documents
p10
aVWe extend ClassifyLDA algorithm by u'\u005cu201c' sprinkling u'\u005cu201d' topics to unlabeled documents
p11
aVWhile classifying a test document, its probability distribution over class labels is inferred using TS-LDA model and it is classified to its most probable class label
p12
aVThe paper revolves around the idea of labeling topics (which are far fewer in number compared to documents) as in ClassifyLDA, and using these labeled topic for sprinkling
p13
aVIf more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t
p14
aVIf a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1
p15
aVThese models can be used for text classification, but they need expensive labeled documents
p16
aVIf a document d belongs to the class c1 then a set of artificial words which represent the class c1 are appended into the document d, otherwise a set of artificial words which represent the class c2 are appended
p17
aVWe evaluate and compare our text classification algorithm by computing Macro averaged F1
p18
aVWe should note here that in TS-LDA, the annotator only labels a few topics and not a single document
p19
aVIf the annotator assigns a wrong class label to a topic representing multiple classes (e.g., first topic in Table 3), then it may affect the performance of the resulting classifier
p20
aVIf the topic assigned to the word w at the position n in document d is t, then we replace it by the class label assigned to the topic t
p21
aVHowever, in our approach the annotator can assign multiple class labels to a topic, hence our approach is more flexible for the annotator to encode her domain knowledge efficiently
p22
aVHence, our approach exerts a low cognitive load on the annotator, at the same time achieves text classification performance close to LDA-SVM which needs labeled documents
p23
aVWe name this model as Topic Sprinkled LDA (TS-LDA
p24
aVWe randomly split this dataset such that 80% is used as training and 20% is used as test data
p25
aVThese topics are very few, when compared to the number of documents
p26
aVHence, we can say here that, in addition to text classification, sprinkling improves coherence of topics
p27
aVAs the inference of LDA is approximate, we repeat all the experiments for each dataset ten times and report average MacroF1
p28
aVHowever, Sprinkled LSI is a supervised technique and hence it requires expensive labeled documents
p29
aVWe can observe here that these two topics are more coherent than the topics in Table 3
p30
aVAs LDA topics are semantically more meaningful than individual words and can be acquired easily, our approach overcomes limitations of the semi-supervised methods discussed above
p31
aVWe randomly split SRAA dataset such that 80% is used as training data and remaining is used as test data
p32
aVThe third type of semi-supervised text classification algorithms is based on active learning
p33
aVAs LSI uses higher order word associations [] , sprinkling of artificial words gives better and class-enriched latent semantic structure
p34
aVSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) is then performed on the sprinkled training documents and a lower rank approximation is constructed by ignoring dimensions corresponding to lower singular values
p35
aVAn important limitation of these algorithms is coming up with a small set of words that should be presented to the annotators for labeling
p36
aVC number of topics on the sprinkled dataset using collapsed Gibbs sampling, where C is the set of class labels of the training documents
p37
aVIn our text classification algorithm, we first infer a set of topics on the given unlabeled document corpus
p38
aVWe use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels
p39
aVIn sprinkling, a set of artificial words are appended to a training document which are specific to the class label of the document
p40
aVWe use this new model to infer the probability distribution of each unlabeled training document over the class labels
p41
aVThese labeled topics are used to create a new topic model such that in the new model topics are better aligned to class labels
p42
aVWe create a set of artificial words corresponding to a class label and add (or sprinkle) them to the document
p43
aVFor SRAA dataset we infer 8 topics on the training dataset and label these 8 topics for all the three classification tasks
p44
aVA class label is assigned to a test document on the basis of its most prominent topics
p45
aVSprinkling [] integrates class labels of documents into Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) []
p46
aVIn our approach, an annotator does not label documents or words, rather she labels a small set of interpretable topics which are inferred in an unsupervised manner
p47
aVWe should note here that, in ClassifyLDA, the annotator is able to assign a single class label to a topic
p48
aVThe number of such artificial terms is proportional to the probability of generating the document by the class label
p49
aVWe modify collapsed Gibbs sampling update in Equation 1 to carry class label information while inferring topics
p50
aVChakraborti et al., 2007) empirically show that sprinkled words boost higher order word associations and projects documents with same class labels close to each other in latent semantic space
p51
aVIn the first category, a small set of labeled documents and a large set of unlabeled documents is used while learning a classifier
p52
aVTWe use these labeled topics and create a TSLDA model using the algorithm described in Table 1
p53
aVWe use these labeled topics to create a new LDA model as follows
p54
aVWe determine the effectiveness of our algorithm in relation to ClassifyLDA algorithm proposed in (Hingmire et al., 2013
p55
aVChakraborti et al., 2007) propose a simple approach called u'\u005cu201c' sprinkling u'\u005cu201d' to incorporate class labels of documents into LSI
p56
aVLDA is an unsupervised probabilistic topic model and it is widely used to discover latent semantic structure of a document collection by modeling words in the documents
p57
aVSimilar to (Blei et al., 2003) we also learn supervised SVM classifier (LDA-SVM) for each dataset using topics as features and report average Macro-F1
p58
aVWe can observe here that most prominent words of the first topic do not represent a single class, while other topics represent either med (medical) or space class
p59
aVWe set K i.e., maximum number of words sprinkled per class to 10
p60
aVWe then update the new LDA model using collapsed Gibbs sampling
p61
aVIn supervised text classification learning algorithms, the learner (a program) takes human labeled documents as input and learns a decision function that can classify a previously unseen document to one of the predefined classes
p62
aVTable 3 shows most prominent words of four topics inferred on the med-space subset of the 20Newsgroup dataset
p63
aVTable 4 shows words corresponding to the top two topics of the TS-LDA model
p64
aVWe then infer a set of
p65
aVHowever, ClassifyLDA performs better than TS-LDA for the three classification tasks of SRAA dataset
p66
aV[] , [] , [] are a few examples of active learning based text classification algorithms
p67
aVHowever, these algorithms are sensitive to initial labeled documents and hyper-parameters of the algorithm
p68
aVWhere, T is the number of topics, u'\u005cu03a6' t is the word probabilities for topic t, u'\u005cu0398' d is the topic probability distribution, zd,n is topic assignment and wd,n is word assignment for nth word position in document d respectively u'\u005cu0391' t and u'\u005cu0392' w are topic and word Dirichlet priors
p69
aVLDA is an unsupervised probabilistic generative model for collections of discrete data such as text documents
p70
aVSimilar to (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), we set symmetric Dirichlet word prior ( u'\u005cu0392' w) for each topic to 0.01 and symmetric Dirichlet topic prior ( u'\u005cu0391' t) for each document to 50/T, where T is number of topics
p71
aVWhile labeling a topic, we show its 30 most probable words to the human annotator
p72
aVIn active learning, particular unlabeled documents or features are selected and queried to an oracle (e.g., human annotator
p73
aVLet, u'\u005cu0398' c,d be the probability of generating document d by class c
p74
aVWe then sprinkle s artificial words of class label c to document d, such that s = K u'\u005cu2217' u'\u005cu0398' c,d for some constant K
p75
aVAn approach that is less demanding in terms of knowledge engineering is ClassifyLDA (Hingmire et al., 2013
p76
aVThe task is to classify the webpages as student, course, faculty or project
p77
aVFor various subsets of the 20Newsgroups and WebKB datasets discussed above, we choose number of topics as twice the number of classes
p78
aVSemi-supervised text classification algorithms proposed in [] , [] , [] and [] are a few examples of this type
p79
aVSeveral researchers have proposed semi-supervised text classification algorithms with the aim of reducing the time, effort and cost involved in labeling documents
p80
aVThis version of the dataset is divided into training (60%) and test (40%) datasets
p81
aVThe posterior inference involves the inference of the hidden topic structure given the observed documents
p82
aVUsually a large number of documents labeled by humans are used by the learner to classify unseen documents with adequate accuracy
p83
aVFor the compreligion-sci dataset TS-LDA and ClassifyLDA have the same performance
p84
aVWe construct classifiers on training datasets and evaluate them on test datasets
p85
aVwhere u'\u005cu03a8' w,c is the count of the word w assigned to the topic c, u'\u005cu2126' c,d is the count of the topic c assigned to words in the document d and W is the vocabulary of the corpus
p86
aVAlso a human annotator may discard or mislabel a polysemous word, which may affect the performance of a text classifier
p87
aVAlgorithm for TS-LDA is summarized in Table 1
p88
aVIn this paper we estimate approximate posterior inference using collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004
p89
aVThis dataset contains 73,218 UseNet articles from four discussion groups, for simulated auto racing (sim auto), simulated aviation (sim aviation), real autos (real auto), real aviation (real aviation
p90
aVWe experimentally verify this hypothesis on three real world datasets
p91
aVHowever, these algorithms are sensitive to the sampling strategy used to query documents or features
p92
aVFollowing are the three classification tasks associated with this dataset
p93
aVThe Gibbs sampling equation used to update the assignment of a topic t to the word w u'\u005cu2208' W at the position n in document d, conditioned on u'\u005cu0391' t, u'\u005cu0392' w is
p94
aVThe Gibbs sampling equation used to update the assignment of a topic t to the word w u'\u005cu2208' W at the position n in document d, conditioned on u'\u005cu0391' t, u'\u005cu0392' w is
p95
aVAfter performing collapsed Gibbs sampling using equation 1, we use word topic assignments to compute a point estimate of the distribution over words u'\u005cu03a6' w,c and a point estimate of the posterior distribution over topics for each document d ( u'\u005cu0398' d) is u'\u005cu03a6' w,t = u'\u005cu03a8' w,t + u'\u005cu0392' w P v u'\u005cu2208' W u'\u005cu03a8' v,t + u'\u005cu0392' v (2) u'\u005cu0398' t,d = u'\u005cu2126' t,d + u'\u005cu0391' t PT i=1 u'\u005cu2126' i,d + u'\u005cu0391' i (3

p97
aVThe key problem in LDA is posterior inference
p98
aVUnfortunately, labeling a large number of documents is a labor-intensive and time consuming process

aVWe can observe that, TS-LDA performs better than ClassifyLDA in 5 of the total 9 subsets
p103
aVWe can also observe that, performance of TS-LDA is close to supervised LDA-SVM
p104

p108
aVLet MD = Z, u'\u005cu03a6' , u'\u005cu0398' be the hidden topic structure, where Z is per word per document topic assignment, u'\u005cu03a6' = { u'\u005cu03a6' t} and u'\u005cu0398' = { u'\u005cu0398' d}
p109
