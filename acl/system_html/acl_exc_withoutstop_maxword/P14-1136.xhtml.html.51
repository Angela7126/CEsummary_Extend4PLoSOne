<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Consequently, the Wsabie Embedding model can share more information between different examples in the training data than the Log-Linear Embedding model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We denote the frames that associate with u'\u2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u2113'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The second baseline, tries to decouple the Wsabie training from the embedding input, and trains a log linear model using the embeddings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So the second baseline has the same input representation as Wsabie Embedding but uses a log-linear model instead of Wsabie</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For fair comparison, we took the lexical units for the predicates that Das et al. considered as seen, and constructed a lexicon with only those; training instances, if any, for the unseen predicates under Das et al u'\u2019' s setup were thrown out as well</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We believe that the Wsabie Embedding model performs better than the Log-Linear Embedding</a>
