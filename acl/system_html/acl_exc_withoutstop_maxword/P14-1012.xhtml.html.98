<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then, we append these features for each phrase pair to the phrase table as extra features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After the pre-training, for each phrase pair in the phrase table, we generate the DBN features [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] by passing the original phrase features X through the DBN using forward computation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>After the fine-tuning, for each phrase pair in the phrase table, we estimate our DAE features by passing the original phrase features X through the u'\u201c' encoder u'\u201d' part of the DAE using forward computation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In our task, we introduce differences by using different initializations and different fractions of the phrase table</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We adapt and extend bidirectional phrase generative probabilities as the input features, which have been used for domain adaptation [ Foster et al.2010 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We consider bidirectional phrase frequency as the input features, and estimate them as</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Using the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence [ Hinton2002 ] , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>To address the first shortcoming, we adapt and extend some simple but effective phrase features as the input features for new DNN feature learning, and these features have been shown significant improvement for SMT, such as, phrase pair similarity [ Zhao et al.2004 ] , phrase frequency, phrase length [ Hopkins and May2011 ] , and phrase generative probability [ Foster et al.2010 ] , which also show further improvement for new phrase feature learning in our experiments</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, we have the second type of input features</a>
