<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Crowdsourcing was slightly more cost-effective than both games in the paid condition, as shown in Table 1 , Column 8</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For all three games, two players play the same game under time limits and then are rewarded if their answers match</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>BabelNet data offers two necessary features for generating the games u'\u2019' datasets</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The strength of both crowdsourcing and games with a purpose comes from aggregating multiple annotations of a single item; i.e.,, while IAA may be low, the majority annotation of an item may be correct</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Last, TKT includes a leaderboard where players can compete for positions; a player u'\u2019' s score is based on increasing her character u'\u2019' s abilities and her accuracy at discarding images from N</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>First, both games intentionally uniformly sample between V and N to increase player engagement, 4 4 Earlier versions that used mostly items from V proved less engaging</a>
