VA hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary
p1
aVThus, a hierarchical summary must also have intra-cluster coherence and parent-to-child coherence
p2
aVMoreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary
p3
aVIn hierarchical summarization, however, a cluster summary may span hundreds of documents and a wide range of information
p4
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering
p5
aVUsers navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused
p6
aVNotice the contribution from a sentence depends on individual salience, coherence ( C u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' h ) based on sentences visible on the user path down the hierarchy to this sentence, and coherence ( P u'\u005cu2062'
