VWe focus in this work on a sentence-level compression system to approximate the ILP-based inference of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which does not restrict compressions to follow input parses but permits the generation of novel dependency relations in output compressions

aVFollowing this, § 2.3 discusses a dynamic program to find maximum weight bigram subsequences from the input sentence, while § 2.4 covers LP relaxation-based approaches for approximating solutions to the problem of finding a maximum-weight subtree in a graph of potential output dependencies

aVFurthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] ,
