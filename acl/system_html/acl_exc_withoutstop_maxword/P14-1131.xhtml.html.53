<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Later on, we will give a matrix formulation to compare CoSimRank with SimRank</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In summary, CoSimRank and SimRank have similar space and time complexities for computing all n 2 similarities</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>CoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes</a>
