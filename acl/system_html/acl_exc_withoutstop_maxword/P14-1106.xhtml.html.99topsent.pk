VOne is based on the leftmost aligned word (leftmost reordering model) and the other is based on the rightmost aligned word (rightmost reordering model), as follows
p1
aVIt shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board
p2
aVBefore we present the algorithm integrating the reordering models, we define the following functions by assuming XP i and XP i + 1 are the constituent pair of interest in CFG rule cfg , H is the translation hypothesis and a is its word alignment
p3
aVThe syntactic reordering model takes a CFG rule (e.g.,, VP u'\u005cu2192' VP u'\u005cu2062' PP u'\u005cu2062' PP ) and models the reordering of the constituents on the
