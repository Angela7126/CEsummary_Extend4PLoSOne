VFor example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background
p1
aVThe same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions in the lexicon these too make sign languages across the world very similar in appearance, even though the meaning of specific articulations may differ [ 7 ]
p2
aVGiven the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows
p3
aVThere is evidence that normalization and whitening [ 13 ] improve performance in unsupervised feature learning [ 4 ]
p4
aVPart of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers
p5
aVThis accuracy is so high that current research has shifted to related more challenging problems language variety identification [ 26 ] , native language identification [ 24 ] and identification at the extremes of scales; many more languages, smaller training data, shorter document lengths
