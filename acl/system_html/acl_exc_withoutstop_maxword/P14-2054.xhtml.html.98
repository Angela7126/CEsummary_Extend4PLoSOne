<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this way, we derive a full parse tree of the original sentence</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Then we augment these parse trees by adding virtual arcs and get the full parse trees of their corresponding original sentences</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Trevor et al. proposed synchronous tree substitution grammar [ 5 ] , which allows local distortion of the tree topology and can thus naturally capture structural mismatches</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We can reversely get the the compressed parse tree by removing all virtual arcs from the full parse tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the first word x 1 is deleted, we connect it to the root of the parse tree x 0 , as shown in Figure 3</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, the time complexity greatly increases since the parse tree dynamically depends on the compression</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We restrict the score of all the virtual arcs to be zero, so that scores of the two parse trees are equivalent</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For any compressed sentence, we could augment its dependency tree by adding a virtual arc i - 1 u'\u2192' i for each deleted word x i</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Recent studies used a subtree deletion model for compression [</a>
