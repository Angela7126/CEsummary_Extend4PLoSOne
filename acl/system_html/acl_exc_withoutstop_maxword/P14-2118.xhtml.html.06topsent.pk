VTo evaluate their model of lexical concreteness, Turney et al
p1
aVWe evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks
p2
aVOn the non-literal composition task, the concreteness (83.0) and combined (85.0) models outperform that of Turney et al
p3
aVTurney et al
p4
aVNotably, our combined model improves on the concreteness-only model, confirming that the interaction of concreteness and subjectivity provides additional information pertinent to meaning composition
p5
aVThe concreteness model performance represents further confirmation of the link between concreteness and composition
p6
aVThe improvement of this model over Turney et al
p7
aV2013 ) crowdsourced data whereas Turney et al infer concreteness scores from a smaller training set
p8
aVUsing an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification
p9
aVIn addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics

aV2) Subjectivity and concreteness can predict aspects of how adjective and noun concepts combine

aVModels were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined
