VInstead of first collecting context vectors and then reweighting these vectors based on various criteria, the vector weights are directly set to optimally predict the contexts in which the corresponding words tend to appear
p1
aVSeveral parameter settings are tried, and the best setting is chosen based on performance on a semantic task that has been selected for tuning
p2
aVFor the count models, PMI is clearly the better weighting scheme, and SVD outperforms NMF as a dimensionality reduction technique
p3
aVWe will refer to DSMs built in the traditional way as count models (since they initialize vectors with co-occurrence counts), and to their training-based alternative as predict(ive) models
p4
aVThe CBOW model learns to predict the word in the middle of a symmetric window based on the sum of the vector representations of the words in the window
p5
aVThe vectors produced by a model are clustered into n groups (with n determined by the gold standard partition) using the CLUTO toolkit [ 26 ] , with the repeated bisections with global optimization method and CLUTO u'\u005cu2019' s default settings otherwise (these are standard choices in the literature
p6
aV1 1 The idea to directly learn a parameter vector based on an objective optimum function is shared by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models [ 8 , 21 ] , where parameters are set to optimize the joint probability distribution of words and documents
p7
aVCount vectors make for better inputs in a phrase similarity task, whereas the two representations are comparable in a paraphrase classification experiment
p8
aVThe last few years have seen the development of a new generation of DSMs that frame the vector estimation problem directly as a supervised task, where the weights in a word vector are set to maximize the probability of the contexts in which the word is observed in the corpus [ 6 , 15 , 14 , 25 , 32 , 44 ]
p9
aVIn this paper, we overcome the comparison scarcity problem by providing a direct evaluation of count and predict DSMs across many parameter settings and on a large variety of mostly standard lexical semantics benchmarks
p10
aVIt has been clear for decades now that raw co-occurrence counts don u'\u005cu2019' t work that well, and DSMs achieve much higher performance when various transformations are applied to the raw vectors, for example by reweighting the counts for context informativeness and smoothing them with dimensionality reduction techniques
p11
aVWe see that, for both approaches, performance is not seriously affected by using the single best setup rather than task-specific settings, except for a considerable drop in performance for the best predict model on esslli (due to the small size of this data set?), and an even more dramatic drop of the count model on ansem

aVFor each verb, we use the corpus-based tuples they make available to select the 20 nouns that are most strongly associated to the verb as subjects or objects, and we average the vectors of these nouns to obtain a u'\u005cu201c' prototype u'\u005cu201d' vector
