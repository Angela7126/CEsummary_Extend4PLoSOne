<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following given query q , pick c = arg max c E P ( c E q ) as a correction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While choosing arg u'\u2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method</a>
