<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Also, as suggested by the experimental result, among the four corpora, FCE corpus is a comparably good resource for training correction detection models with our current feature set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the resulting basic edits do not match with those that compose the actual corrections, we attribute the error to the first step</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The teachers u'\u2019' annotations are treated as gold standard for the detailed corrections</a>
