<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\ud835' u'\udc03' of the learned WRRBM</a>
