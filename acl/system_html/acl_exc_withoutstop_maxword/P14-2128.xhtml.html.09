<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we conduct a set of experiments to show the influence of punctuations on dependency parsing accuracies</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Results are listed in Table 1, where row 2 and row 3 list the UAS of words (all excluding punctuations) on the development and test set, respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Row 4 and row 5 list accuracies of punctuations (all excluding words) on the development and test set, respectively</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To see this, we evaluate the parsing accuracies of the selected parsers on words and punctuations, separately</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To see this, we divide the sentences in the development set into sub-sets according the punctuation ratio (percentage of punctuations that a sentence contains), and then evaluate parsing accuracies on the sub-sets separately</a>
