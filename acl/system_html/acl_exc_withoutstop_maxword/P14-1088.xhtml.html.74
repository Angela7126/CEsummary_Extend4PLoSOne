<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These metrics express agreement on a nominal coding task as the ratio u'\u039a' , u'\u03a0' = A o - A e / 1 - A e where A o is the observed agreement and A e the expected agreement according to some model of u'\u201c' random u'\u201d' annotation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The reason the PCEDT gets such low LAS is essentially the same as the reason many sentences had to be excluded from the computation in the first place; since inserting and deleting nodes is an integral part of the tectogrammatical annotation task, the assumption implicit in the LAS computation that sentences with the same number of nodes have the same nodes in the same order is obviously false, resulting in a very low LAS</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore we remove the leaf nodes in the case of phrase structure trees, and in the case of dependency trees we compare trees whose edges are unlabelled and nodes are labelled with the dependency relation between that word and its head; the root node receives the label u'\u0395'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic</a>
