(lp0
VThe title of each English article is translated into Chinese and represented as a vector
p1
aVBecause of the large difference in title lengths, the value of the title similarity feature between the English article u'\u005cu201c' Nero u'\u005cu201d' and the corresponding Chinese article is low
p2
aVThen, cosine similarity between this vector and the vector of each Chinese title is measured as title similarity
p3
aVBecause title similarity of the articles is a widely used method, we choose English and Chinese title similarity as the baseline
p4
aVWe regard the appearance of the English title in the first sentence of a Baidu Baike article as a binary feature
p5
aVIn the title similarity method, every Chinese article title is represented as a vector, and each distinct character in all these titles is a dimension of all vectors
p6
aVThe similarity values generated by title matching and title similarity are used directly as real value features in the SVM model
p7
aVWe use the results of title matching and title similarity from the candidate selection stage as two features for the candidate ranking stage
p8
aVIn query translation, we translate the title of every English article into Chinese and then use these translated titles as queries to retrieve articles from the Chinese encyclopedia
p9
aVTo extract possible candidates, two similarity calculation methods are carried out title matching and title similarity
p10
aVNext, we check if there is a Chinese article in Baidu Baike with exactly the same title as the one in Chinese Wikipedia
p11
aVIf so, the corresponding English Wikipedia article and the Baidu Baike article are paired in the gold standard
p12
aVIf the candidate selection method can actually select the correct Chinese candidate, the recall will be high
p13
aVThe second stage of our approach is to score each viable candidate using a supervised learning method, and then sort all candidates in order of score from high to low as final output
p14
aVThe first kind of error is due to large literal differences between the English and Chinese titles
p15
aVIn our title matching method, we formulate candidate selection as an English-Chinese cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) problem [ 8 ] , in which every English article‚Äôs title is treated as a query and all the articles in the Chinese encyclopedia are treated as the documents
p16
aV[ 6 ] Thus, the distribution of terms is good measurement of article similarity
p17
aVSuch length differences may cause the SVM model to rank the correct answer lower when the difference of other features are not so significant because the contents of the Chinese candidates are similar
p18
aVIf the English title appears in the first sentence, the value of this feature is 1; otherwise, the value is 0
p19
aVSince the two encyclopedias u'\u005cu2019' article formats differ, we copy the information in each article (title, content, category, etc.) into a standardized XML structure
p20
aVBecause the number of all possible words is too large, we adopt a topic model to gather the words into some latent topics
p21
aVIn this study, we only carry out title hypernym extraction on the first sentences of English articles due to the looser syntactic structure of Chinese
p22
aVEach topic is represented by a distribution of words, and each word has a probability score used to measure its contribution to the topic
p23
aVTo avoid this problem, we first replace all instances of an article u'\u005cu2019' s title in the first sentence with pronouns
p24
aVLDA can be seen as a typical probabilistic approach to latent topic computation
p25
aVThen, individual feature functions F k u'\u005cu2062' ( x i , y j ) are based on the feature properties of both article a i and a j
p26
aVIf two articles do not describe the same topic, the distribution of terms is often scattered
p27
aVSince alternative encyclopedias like Baidu Baike are larger (by article count) and growing faster than the Chinese Wikipedia, it is worth-while to investigate creating cross-language links among different online encyclopedias
p28
aVWe can calculate the entropy of the distribution as a value for SVM
p29
aVBecause our approach uses an SVM model, the data set should be split into training and test sets
p30
aVEach article x i in KB K 1 can be represented by a feature vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' i = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) , f 2 u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f n u'\u005cu2062' ( x i )
p31
aVThese extracted hypernyms can be treated as article categories
p32
aVThe first sentence of this article is u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games is a 2008 young adult novel by American writer Suzanne Collins u'\u005cu201d' Since article titles may be named entities or compound nouns, the dependency parser may mislabel them and thus output an incorrect parse tree
p33
aVThe entropy is defined as follows
p34
aVFor each encyclopedia K , a collection of human-written articles, can be defined as K = { a i } i = 1 n , where a i is an article in K and n is the size of K
p35
aVSince knowledge bases (KB) may contain millions of articles, comparison between all possible pairs in two knowledge bases is time-consuming and sometimes impractical
p36
aVFor example, the previous sentence is rewritten as u'\u005cu201c' It is a 2008 young adult novel by American writer Suzanne Collins u'\u005cu201d' Then, the dependency parser generates the following parse tree
p37
aVThe final evaluation results are calculated as the mean of the average of these 30 evaluation sets
p38
aV[ 4 ] If any pattern matches the structure of the dependency parse tree, the hypernym can be extracted
p39
aVHowever, when linking between different online encyclopedia platforms this is more difficult as many of these structural features are different or not shared
p40
aVTo measure the quality of cross-language entity linking, we use the following three metrics
p41
aVTherefore, articles containing the same hypernym are likely to belong to the same category
p42
aVThe false positive u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶ÑÁéã u'\u005cu201d' is a historical novel about the life of the Emperor Nero
p43
aVThus, we can extract the hypernym u'\u005cu201c' novel u'\u005cu201d' from the previous example
p44
aVIn this pattern, the rightmost leaf is the hypernym target
p45
aVThen, for each English article and Chinese candidate pair in testing, the LDA model provides the distribution of the latent topics
p46
aVEnglish and Chinese terms are all regarded as terms of the same language and the LDA topic model, namely mixed-language topic model, generates both English and Chinese terms for each latent topic
p47
aVFor pairs that have both English and Chinese articles, the Chinese article title is regarded as the translation of the English one
p48
aVTo train the LDA model, the pair English and Chinese articles are concatenated into a single document
p49
aVThe entropy of the estimated topic distribution of a related article is expected to be lower than that of an unrelated article
p50
aVThe first sentence of an encyclopedia article usually contains the title of the article
p51
aVIn this paper, we propose a method comprising title and hypernym translation and mixed-language topic model methods to select and link related articles between the English Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias
p52
aVAfter extracting the hypernym of the English article, the hypernym is translated into Chinese
p53
aVIn order to evaluate the performance of cross-language article linking between English Wikiepdia and Chinese Baidu Baike, we compile an English-Chinese evaluation dataset from Wikipedia and Baidu Baike online encyclopedias
p54
aVIn a Baidu Baike article, the first sentence may contain a parenthetical translation of the main title
p55
aVFor example, for the English article u'\u005cu201c' Jensen Ackles u'\u005cu201d' , our approach generates a link to the Chinese article u'\u005cu201c' Jensen u'\u005cu201d' in Baidu Baike
p56
aVIn the results, we can observe that mix-language topic model, hypernym, and English title occurence features all noticeably improve the performance
p57
aVOur approach to cross-language article linking comprises two stages candidate selection, which produces a list of candidate articles, and candidate ranking, which ranks that list
p58
aVIn order to generate the gold standard evaluation sets of correct English and Chinese article pairs, we automatically collect English-Chinese inter-language links from Wikipedia
p59
aVFor each English article queries, ten output Baidu Baike candidates are generated in a ranked list
p60
aVThe title of the correct Chinese article is the full name of the Roman Emperor Nero (Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus
p61
aVWe use the support vector machine (SVM) approach to determine the probability of each pair ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' i , u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' j ) being equivalent
p62
aVFirst, our spider crawls the entire contents of English Wikipedia and Chinese Baidu Baike
p63
aVNext, we can use entropy to measure the distribution of topics
p64
aVFor a linked English-Chinese article pair, the distribution of words used in each usually shows some convergence
p65
aVIn document translation, we translate the contents of the entire Chinese encyclopedia into English and then search them using the original English titles
p66
aVThe value of this feature in the SVM model is calculated as follows
p67
aVFor example, for the English article u'\u005cu201c' Nero u'\u005cu201d' , our approach ranks the Chinese candidate u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶ÑÁéã u'\u005cu201d' ( u'\u005cu201c' King Nero u'\u005cu201d' ) as number one, instead of the correct answer u'\u005cu201c' Â∞ºÁ¶Ñ¬∑ÂÖãÂä≥ÁãÑ‰πåÊñØ¬∑Âæ∑È≤ÅËãèÊñØ¬∑Êó•ËÄ≥ÊõºÂ∞ºÂ∫ìÊñØ u'\u005cu201d' (the number two candidate
p68
aVThe total number of Chinese articles is about one-quarter of English ones, and only 2.3% of English articles have inter-language links to their Chinese versions
p69
aVThe term u'\u005cu201c' novel u'\u005cu201d' is the extracted hypernym of the English article u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games u'\u005cu201d'
p70
aVEquivalent articles are articles that describe the same topic in different languages
p71
aVFor this feature, we use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3 ]
p72
aVwhere T is the number of latent topics, u'\u005cu0398' d u'\u005cu2062' j is the topic distribution of a given topic j
p73
aVIn order to show the benefits of each feature used in the SVM model, we conduct a experiment to test the performance of different feature combinations
p74
aVArticle linking can then be defined as follows
p75
aVThese results show that our method is very effective in linking articles in English Wikipedia to those in Baidu Baike
p76
aVGiven two encyclopedia K 1 and K 2 , cross-language article linking is the task of finding the corresponding equivalent article a j from encyclopedia K 2 for each article a i from encyclopedia K 1
p77
aVFor example, the first sentence of the Chinese article on San Francisco is u'\u005cu201c' ÊóßÈáëÂ±±ÔºàSan FranciscoÔºâÔºåÂèàËØë‚ÄòÂú£ÂºóÊúóË•øÊñØÁßë‚Äô„ÄÅ‚Äò‰∏âËó©Â∏Ç‚Äô„ÄÇ u'\u005cu201d'
p78
aVTitle translation is an effective and widely used method of creating cross-language links between encyclopedia articles
p79
aVRecall is used to measure the performance of the candidate selection method
p80
aVWe separate all words in the translated and original English article titles with the u'\u005cu201c' OR u'\u005cu201d' operator before submission to the search engine
p81
aVOur SVM model u'\u005cu2019' s features are described below
p82
aVTo generate dependency parse trees for the sentences, we adopt the Stanford Dependency Parser
p83
aVTo demonstrate this idea, let us take the English article u'\u005cu201c' The Hunger Games u'\u005cu201d' for example
p84
aV* 1 MTM mix-language topic model * 2 HT hypernym translation * 3 ETO
p85
aVFor example, the first sentence of the u'\u005cu201c' iPad u'\u005cu201d' article in the English Wikipedia begins, u'\u005cu201c' iPad is a line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc u'\u005cu2026' u'\u005cu201d' In this sentence, the term u'\u005cu201c' tablet computers u'\u005cu201d' is the hypernym of iPad
p86
aVIt may also contain a hypernym that defines the category of the article
p87
aVTo avoid brute-force comparison, we first select plausible candidate articles on which to focus our efforts
p88
aVCross-language article linking between different encyclopedias can be formulated as follows
p89
aVN is the number of English query; r i , j is j -th correct Chinese article for i -th English query; c i , k is k -th candiate the system output for i -th English query
p90
aVThe top predicted corresponding article y j in the knowledge base K 2 for an input article x i in K 1 should receive a higher score than any other entity in K 2 , a m u'\u005cu2208' K 2 , m u'\u005cu2260' j
p91
aVWe select the top 500 English-Chinese article pairs with the highest page view counts in Baidu Baike
p92
aVFor example, the English article u'\u005cu201c' Raccoon u'\u005cu201d' is linked to the Baidu article u'\u005cu201c' Áã∏ u'\u005cu201d' (raccoon dog), though the correct one is ‚ÄúÊµ£ÁÜä‚Äù (raccoon
p93
aVThe two semantically corresponding articles often have many related terms, which results in clusters of specific words
p94
aVACC measures the correctness of the first candidate in the candidate list
p95
aVThen, we manually designed seven patterns to extract hypernyms from the parse tree structures
p96
aVTo evaluate the performance of our method on linking different types of encyclopedia articles, we compile a set containing the most popular articles
p97
aVTable 2 shows the final results of different feature combinations
p98
aVIn China, for example Baidu Baike and Hudong are the largest encyclopedia sites, containing more than 6.2 and 7 million Chinese articles respectively
p99
aVNext, we apply our predefined syntactic patterns to extract the hypernym
p100
aVWe employ the two main CLIR methods query translation and document translation
p101
aVTable 1 shows the statistics of inter-language link pages in the English and Chinese editions in February 2014
p102
aVOther methods must be used along with title translation to create a more robust linking tool
p103
aVAlthough our method can effectively generate cross-language links with high accuracy, some correct candidates are not ranked number one
p104
aVSeveral works have focused on creating cross-language links between Wikipedia language versions [ 7 , 9 ] or finding a cross-language link for each entity mention in a Wikipedia article, namely Cross-Language Link Discovery (CLLD) [ 10 , 5 ]
p105
aVThe second error type is caused by articles that have duplicates in Baidu Baike
p106
aVEnglish title occurrence u'\u005cu2020' This config outperforms the best config in last level with statistically significant difference
p107
aVHowever, there is another Baidu article u'\u005cu201c' Ë©πÊ£Æ¬∑ÈòøÂÖãÊñØ u'\u005cu201d' ( u'\u005cu201c' Jensen Ackles u'\u005cu201d'
p108
aV[ 11 , 1 ] However, title translation alone is not always sufficient
p109
aVThen, another feature is added to each configuration until all the features have been added
p110
aVIn this case, our approach still generates a correct link, although it is not the one in the gold standard
p111
aVFor the query- and document-translation steps, we use the Lucene search engine with similarity scores calculated by the Okapi BM25 ranking function [ 2 ]
p112
aVCombining two of these three feature has more improvement and the combination of all the features achieves the best
p113
aVSimilarly, in Korea, Naver Knowledge Encyclopedia has a large presence
p114
aVRecall is the fraction of the retrieved articles that are relevant to the given query
p115
aVWikipedia has many language versions, and articles in one language contain hyperlinks to corresponding pages in other languages
p116
aVWe also compile a suitable dataset from the above two encyclopedias to evaluate the linking accuracy of our method
p117
aVThese two articles both describe the actor Jensen Ackles
p118
aVThe resulting list contains our title-matching candidates
p119
aVAlso, we have u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' j = ( f 1 u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) , f 2 u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) , u'\u005cu2026' , f n u'\u005cu2062' ( y j ) ) for a candidate article y j in KB K 2
p120
aVIn some cases, for example, the titles of corresponding articles in different languages do not even match
p121
aVThese works were able to exploit the link structure and metadata common to all Wikipedia language versions
p122
aVTraditional MRR measures any correct answer produced by the system from among the candidates
p123
aVThe top 100 results for the query-translation and the top 100 results for document-translation steps are unionized
p124
aVTo date, little research has been done into linking between encyclopedias on different platforms
p125
aVThe overall results of our method achieves 80.95% in MRR and 87.46% in recall
p126
aVA u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' C = 1 means that all top candidates are correctly linked (i.e.,†they match one of the references), and A u'\u005cu2062' C u'\u005cu2062' C = 0 means that none of the top candidates is correct
p127
aVOnline encyclopedias are among the most frequently used Internet services today u'\u005cu2020' u'\u005cu2020' * corresponding author One of the largest and best known online encyclopedias is Wikipedia
p128
aVThis set represents the articles people in China are most interested in
p129
aVAn MRR closer to 1 implies that the correct answer usually appears close to the top of the n-best lists
p130
aVFigure 1 shows the top- k ACC from the top 1 to 5
p131
aVIn the above example, the following pattern is matched
p132
aVThe third error type is translation errors
p133
aV1/MRR approximates the average rank of the correct transliteration
p134
aVHowever, there are alternatives to Wikipedia for some languages
p135
aVFor all E-C and C-E translation tasks, we use Google Translate
p136
aVwhere h is the hypernym, t u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' t u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( h ) is the Chinese translation of the term h
p137
aVHowever, the coverage of different language ver-sions of Wikipedia is very inconsistent
p138
aVAfter examining the results, we can divide errors into several categories
p139
aVFor statistical generality, each data set is randomly split 4:1 (training:test) 30 times
p140
aVThe reason is that Google Translate provides the translation u'\u005cu201c' Áã∏ u'\u005cu201d' instead of u'\u005cu201c' Êµ£ÁÜä u'\u005cu201d'
p141
aVTo define the metrics, we use following notations
