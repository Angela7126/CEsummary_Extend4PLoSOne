<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The words suggest , think , and believe also purport to describe the private mental state of the source, but their framing function is the opposite of the predicates of knowledge they imply that it is important to mark the claim as the source u'\u2019' s belief, and not a widely-accepted fact</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We performed another set of linear regressions, again using the mean certainty rating as the dependent variable</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The cues that give the highest factuality coefficients are learn and admit , which are labeled as predicates of knowledge</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our interest in this text is specifically in quoted content u'\u2014' including u'\u201c' indirect u'\u201d' quotes,</a>
