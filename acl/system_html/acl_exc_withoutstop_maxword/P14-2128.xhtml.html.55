<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Consequently, punctuations are not as consistently annotated in treebanks as words, making it harder to parse punctuations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since long sentences are inherently more difficult to parse, to make a fair comparison, we further divide the development set according to sentence lengths as shown in the first row 4 4 1694 out of 1700 sentences on the development set with length no larger than 60 tokens</a>
