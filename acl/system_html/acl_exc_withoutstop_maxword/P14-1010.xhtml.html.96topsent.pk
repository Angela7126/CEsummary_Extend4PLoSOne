VWe approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words
p1
aVWork on target language morphological segmentation for SMT can be divided into three subproblems segmentation, desegmentation and integration
p2
aVIn this section, we describe our various strategies for desegmenting the SMT system u'\u005cu2019' s output space, along with the features that we add to take advantage of this desegmented view
p3
aVMost techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model
p4
aVOur goal is to desegment the decoder u'\u005cu2019' s output lattice, and in doing so, gain access to a compact, desegmented view of a large portion of the translation search space
p5
aVWe compose this acceptor with a desegmenting transducer, and then with an unsegmented LM acceptor, producing a fully annotated, desegmented lattice
p6
aVDoing so enables the inclusion of an unsegmented target language model, and with a small amount of bookkeeping, it also allows the inclusion of features related to the operations performed during desegmentation (see Section 3.4
p7
aVNonetheless, the 1000-best and lattice desegmenters both produce significant improvements over the 1-best
