<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Computational models of meaning that rely on corpus-extracted context vectors, such as LSA [ 31 ] , HAL [ 36 ] , Topic Models [ 20 ] and more recent neural-network approaches [ 11 , 38 ] have successfully tackled a number of lexical semantics tasks, where context vector similarity highly correlates with various indices of semantic relatedness [ 53 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, ESP constitutes a more realistic, and at the same time more challenging, simulation of how things are encountered in real life, testing the potentials of cross-modal mapping in dealing with the complex scenes that one would encounter in event recognition and caption generation tasks</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Without the ability to refer to the outside world, context vectors are arguably useless for practical goals such as learning to execute natural language instructions [ 3 , 10 ] , that could greatly benefit from the rich network of lexical meaning such vectors encode, in order to scale up to real-life challenges</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, once the learner observes a new object, she can easily construct a full visual representation for it (and the acquisition literature has shown that humans are wired for good object segmentation and recognition [ 50 ] ) u'\u2013' the more challenging task is to scan the ongoing and very ambiguous linguistic communication for contexts that might be relevant and informative about the new object</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that cross-modal projections can be used effectively to simulate a fast mapping scenario, thus strengthening the claims of this approach as a full-fledged, fully inductive theory of meaning acquisition</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This line of research has traditionally assumed artificial models of the external world, typically a set of linguistic or logical labels for objects, actions and possibly other aspects of a scene [ 46 ]</a>
