<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect u'\u201c' children u'\u201d' is mapped to 2 concepts while u'\u201c' dental caries u'\u201d' is mapped to 3 concepts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, as shown in Figure 1 , one aspect is mapped to two concepts while the other is mapped to three</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Although existing retrieval functions can be directly applied to concept-based representation, they may lead to non-optimal performance</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Within the concept-based representation, the query can then be represented as a bag of all the generated CUIs in the MetaMap</a>
