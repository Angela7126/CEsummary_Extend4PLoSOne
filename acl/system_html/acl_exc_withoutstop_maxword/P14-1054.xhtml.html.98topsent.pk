VThose are generated by combining two entity types or two entity subtypes into a semantic pair
p1
aVEntity types and subtypes are employed as semantic pair
p2
aVSemantic pair is generated by combining two semantic units
p3
aVHead noun and adjacent entity POS tag are employed to combine with positional information
p4
aVIn this paper, for a better demonstration of the constraint condition, we still use the Position Sensitive as the default setting to use the Head noun and the adjacent entity POS tag
p5
aVThe extent mention includes both the head and its modifiers
p6
aVExcept in Row 8 and Row 11, when two head nouns of entity pair were combined as semantic pair and when POS tag were combined with the entity type, the performances are decreased
p7
aVIt is encoded by combining the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention information
p8
aVBoth head noun and POS tag are position sensitive
p9
aVBecause the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be generated
p10
aVIn short, from Table 4 we have seen that the entity type and subtype maximize the performance when used as semantic pair
p11
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' 台北_E1 u'\u005cu2019' means that the head noun u'\u005cu2018' 台北
