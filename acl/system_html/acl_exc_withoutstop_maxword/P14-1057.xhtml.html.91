<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since each visit can be associated with multiple medical records, the relevance of a visit is related to the relevance of individual associated medical records</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Existing studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores as the relevance score of a visit [ 15 , 30 , 12 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, when converting the text to concepts representation using MetaMap, the occurrences of the concepts are determined by not only the original term occurrences, a good indicator of relevance, but also the number of mapped concepts, which is determined by MetaMap and has nothing to do with the relevance status</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In particular, given a patient u'\u2019' s visit, all the medical records generated from this visit are merged</a>
