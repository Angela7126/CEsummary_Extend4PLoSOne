<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that we do not consider high-frequency senses with frequency higher than 0.6, as it is rare for a medium- to high-frequency word to take on a novel sense which is then the predominant sense in a given corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because of domain differences and the skewed nature of word sense distributions, it is often the case that some senses in a sense inventory will not be attested in a given corpus</a>
