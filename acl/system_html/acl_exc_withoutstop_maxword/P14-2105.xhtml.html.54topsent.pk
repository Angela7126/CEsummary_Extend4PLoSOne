VBy using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set

aV2013 ) , we train two semantic similarity models one links a mention from the question to an entity in the KB and the other maps a relation pattern to a relation

aVWe adapt the work of [ 8 , 15 ] for measuring the semantic distance between a question and relational triples in the KB as the core component of our semantic parsing approach

aVA single-relation question is defined as a question composed of an entity mention and a binary relation description, where the answer to this question would be an entity that has the relation with the given entity
