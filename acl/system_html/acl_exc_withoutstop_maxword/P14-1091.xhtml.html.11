<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>2) We propose a robust method to transform single-relation questions into formal triple queries as their MRs, which trades off between transformation accuracy and recall using question patterns and relation expressions respectively</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>From experiments (Table 3 in Section 4.3) we can see that, question pattern based question translation can achieve high end-to-end accuracy</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Algorithm 2 shows how to generate formal triples for a span u'\ud835' u'\udcac' based on question patterns ( u'\ud835' u'\udcac' u'\u2062' u'\ud835' u'\udcab' -based question translation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose a dependency tree-based method to handle such multiple-constraint questions by (i) decomposing the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntax-based patterns; and (ii) intersecting the answers of all sub-questions as the final answers of the original question</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Formally, given a knowledge base u'\ud835' u'\udca6' u'\u2062' u'\u212c' and an NL question u'\ud835' u'\udcac' , our KB-QA method generates a set of formal triples-answer pairs { u'\u27e8' u'\ud835' u'\udc9f' , u'\ud835' u'\udc9c' u'\u27e9' } as derivations, which are scored and ranked by the distribution P ( u'\u27e8' u'\ud835' u'\udc9f' , u'\ud835' u'\udc9c' u'\u27e9' u'\ud835' u'\udca6' u'\u212c' , u'\ud835' u'\udcac' ) defined as follows</a>
