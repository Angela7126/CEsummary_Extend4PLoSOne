<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When hard constraints can be encoded as linear equations on the output variables, and the underlying model u'\u2019' s inference task can be posed as linear optimization, one can formulate this constrained inference problem as an integer linear program (ILP) [ 15 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper introduces a novel method for imposing soft constraints via dual decomposition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The algorithms we present in later sections for handling soft global constraints and for learning the penalties of these constraints can be applied to general structured linear models, not just CRFs, provided we have an available algorithm for performing MAP inference</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We also propose a method for learning the penalties the prediction problem incurs for violating these soft constraints</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that when performing MAP subject to soft constraints, optimal solutions might not satisfy some constraints, since doing so would reduce the model u'\u2019' s score by too much</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Dual Decomposition is a popular method for performing MAP inference in this scenario, since it leverages known algorithms for MAP in the base problem where these extra constraints have not been added [ 11 , 20 , 18 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is necessary because u'\u039b' is a vector of dual variables for inequality constraints</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Because our learning method drives many penalties to zero, it allows practitioners to perform u'\u2018' constraint selection, u'\u2019' in which a large number of automatically-generated candidate global constraints can be considered</a>
