VWe integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger
p1
aVThe main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u005cu2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )
p2
aVThis can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc03' of the learned WRRBM
