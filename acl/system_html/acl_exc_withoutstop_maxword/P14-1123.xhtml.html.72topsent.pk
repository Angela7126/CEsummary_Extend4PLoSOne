VGuided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion
p1
aVBased on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level

aVNot surprisingly, Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near non-existence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses

aVThese high error rates at the recognition stage negatively affect the subsequent stages of the speech scoring system in general, and in particular,
