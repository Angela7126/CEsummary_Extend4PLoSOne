<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For a feature u'\u0391' belonging to a template F , with probability p we will draw a noise feature u'\u0392' also belonging to F , according to some distribution q</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, by including these elements, standard dropout is considerably slower, as we show in our experiments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If we define the scatter matrix of the uncorrupted input as u'\ud835' u'\udc12' = u'\ud835' u'\udc17' u'\ud835' u'\udc17' u'\u22a4' , the solutions under dropout noise are</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can exploit this structure by using an alternative dropout scheme for each token, choose exactly one feature template</a>
