<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose two separate discourse representation schemes u'\u2013' one shallow, centered around discourse markers, and one deep, based on RST</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The discourse parser model (DPM) is based on the RST discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We label marker arguments based on their similarity to question content</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So far, we have treated LS and discourse as distinct features in the reranking model, However, given that LS features greatly improve the CR baseline, we hypothesize that a natural extension to the discourse models would be to make use of LS similarity (in addition to the traditional information retrieval similarity) to label discourse segments</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is important to note that these discourse features are more expressive than features based on discourse markers alone [ 5 , 19 ]</a>
