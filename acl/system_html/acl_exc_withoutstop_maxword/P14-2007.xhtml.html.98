<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As stated above, the time-to-annotate is one good candidate</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Hence, we use a cognitive technique to create our annotated dataset</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Manual annotation of complexity scores may not be intuitive and reliable</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, saccade duration is not significant for annotation of short text, as in our case</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We ensure the quality of our dataset in different ways a) Our annotators are instructed to avoid unnecessary head movements and eye-movements outside the experiment environment b) To minimize noise due to head movements further, they are also asked to state the annotation verbally, which was then manually recorded, (c) Our annotators are students between the ages 20-24 with English as the primary language of academic instruction and have secured a TOEFL iBT score of 110 or above</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the complexity of the text can be estimated even before the annotation begins , the pricing model can be fine-tuned (pay</a>
