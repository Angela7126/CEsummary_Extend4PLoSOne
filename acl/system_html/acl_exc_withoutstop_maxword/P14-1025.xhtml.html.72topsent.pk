VThere has been a considerable amount of research on representing word senses and disambiguating usages of words in context ( wsd ) as, in order to produce computational systems that understand and produce natural language, it is essential to have a means of representing and disambiguating word sense wsd algorithms require word sense information to disambiguate token instances of a given ambiguous word, e.g., in the form of sense definitions [] , semantic relationships [ 17 ] or annotated data [ 20 ]

aVPart of the reason for this improvement is simply that the average polysemy in \u005csmaller Macmillan (5.6 senses per target lemma) is slightly less than in \u005csmaller WordNet (6.7 senses per target lemma), 13 13 Note that the set of lemmas differs between the respective datasets, so this isn u'\u005cu2019' t an accurate reflection
