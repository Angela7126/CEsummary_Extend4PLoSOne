<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In consideration of the Chinese characteristics, we use every potential word in a relation mention as the lexical features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, the Chinese relation extraction is more difficult</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>[] also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The entity mention is annotated with its full extent and its head , referred to as the extend mention and the head mention respectively</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is encoded by combining the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention information</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A feature is employed as a singleton feature when it is used without combining with any information</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Aiming at the Chinese inattentive structure, we utilize the soft constraint to capture the local dependency in a relation instance</a>
