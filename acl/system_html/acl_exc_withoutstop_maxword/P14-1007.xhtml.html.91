<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, the guidelines treat relative clauses as subordinate clauses and thus negation inside a relative clause is treated as bound to that clause only, and includes neither the head noun of the relative clause nor any of its other dependents in its scope</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus in order to match the gold annotations, we define a set of heuristics for when to count vacuous words as in scope</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our crawling rules operate on semantic representations, but the annotations are with reference to the surface string</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The negation cue for a negated nominal argument will appear as a quantifier EP in the MRS, triggering line 3 of our algorithm</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, from the perspective of MRS, a negated relative clause is indistinguishable from any other negated modifier of a noun</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We proceed with argument crawling and label crawling ,</a>
