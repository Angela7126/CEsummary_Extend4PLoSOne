VImportantly, the semantics listed here is not just for the verb spray but applies to all verbs from the Spray Class whenever they appear in that syntactic frame u'\u005cu2013' that is, VerbNet assumes the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p1
aVThat is, all verbs in the same class appear in the same set of syntactic frames
p2
aVWe then considered how many verbs in each class had the same annotation in any given syntactic frame
p3
aVThat is, ideally there would be some database of semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs from each syntactic class
p4
aVAs such, this task provides a lower bound for how much semantic consistency one might expect within a syntactic verb class
p5
aVAs noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments
p6
aVThus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet
p7
aVEven a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames
p8
aVImportantly, in addition to characterizing the syntactic frames associated with each class, VerbNet also characterizes the
