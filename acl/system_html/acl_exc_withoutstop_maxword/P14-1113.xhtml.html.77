<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The hierarchies are represented as relations of pairwise words</a>
