VOur method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations
p1
aVOne reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy the u'\u005cu201c' no crossing links u'\u005cu201d' constraint, and errors in punctuations may prevent correct word-word dependencies from being created (see section 2
p2
aVFirst, the lexical heads of punctuations are not as well defined as those of words
p3
aVWe can see that although all the parsers achieve above 90 u'\u005cu2062' % UAS on words, the UAS on punctuations are mostly below 85 u'\u005cu2062' %
p4
aVThe result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing
p5
aVIn such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary
p6
aVOur method is able to capture that the root, w h , of the sub-tree within the paired-punctuation, such as u'\u005cu201c' Mechanisms u'\u005cu201d' in Figure 1, generally serves as a modifier of the words outside, while the baseline parser occasionally make w h as the head of the sentence
p7
aVThe result is that more than 31 u'\u005cu2062' % of the parameter updates are caused due to punctuations, though punctuations account for only 11.6 u'\u005cu2062' % of the total tokens in the training set
p8
aVMoreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations
p9
aVThe fact that most previous work evaluates parsing accuracies without taking punctuations into account is also largely due to this reason
p10
aVConsequently, punctuations are not as consistently annotated in treebanks as words, making it harder to parse punctuations
p11
aVTo utilize such boundary information, we further classify paired punctuations into two categories those that serve as the beginning of the boundary, whose POS tags are either -LRB- or u'\u005cu201c' , denoted by Bpunc ; and those that serve as the end of the boundary, denoted by Epunc
p12
aVBy inspecting the parser outputs, we found that error propagation caused by assigning incorrect head to punctuations is one of the main reason that leads to this result
p13
aVAs for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with no ambiguity
p14
aVThe fact that parsers achieve low accuracies on punctuations is to some degree expected, because the head of a punctuation mark is linguistically less well-defined
p15
aVNote that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account
p16
aVIn this experiment, we first remove all punctuations from the original data and then modify the dependency arcs accordingly in order to maintain word-word dependencies in the original data
p17
aVHowever, the exact type of errors that are corrected by using non-paired punctuations is more difficult to summarize
p18
aVThis is as expected, since beam search also has the effect of reducing error propagation [ 15 ] , thereby alleviating the errors caused by punctuations
p19
aVFor example, the distance features in line 5 of Table 3 is used to capture the pattern that if a word w with comma property is the left modifier of a noun or a verb, the distance between w and its lexical head is often larger than 1
p20
aVAs we increase the beam width, the improvement of our method over the baseline becomes smaller
p21
aVHowever, we do not assign a Paired property to Buccaneers since its ( flag is still on
p22
aVThe only special case is that if w h already contains a Bpunc property, then our method simply ignores the non-paired property since we maintain the boundary information with the highest priority
p23
aVHowever, if the quotation mark, u'\u005cu201c' , is incorrectly recognized as a modifier of was , due to the u'\u005cu201c' no crossing links u'\u005cu201d' constraint, the arc between Mechanisms and entitled can never be created
p24
aVWe use the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank with the standard splits sections 02-21 are used as the training set; section 22 and section 23 are used as the development and test set, respectively
p25
aVTake the sentence shown in Figure 1 (a) for example, the word Mechanisms is a modifier of entitled according to the gold reference
p26
aVIn the example, when Congrees u'\u005cu2019' s is identified as a modifier of Buccaneers, the u'\u005cu201d' flag of Buccaneers is turned off
p27
aVAlthough the improvement becomes smaller as the beam width grows larger, we still achieved 93.06 u'\u005cu2062' % UAS with a beam of width 64, which is the best result for transition-based parsers reported so far
p28
aVSince long sentences are inherently more difficult to parse, to make a fair comparison, we further divide the development set according to sentence lengths as shown in the first row 4 4 1694 out of 1700 sentences on the development set with length no larger than 60 tokens
p29
aVPenn2Malt is used to convert bracketed structures into dependencies
p30
aVSuch properties are used as additional features to guide the parser to construct the dependency graph
p31
aVResults are listed in Table 1, where row 2 and row 3 list the UAS of words (all excluding punctuations) on the development and test set, respectively
p32
aVTo see this, we evaluate the parsing accuracies of the selected parsers on words and punctuations, separately
p33
aVBefore parsing starts and after the preprocessing step for paired punctuations, our method employs a second preprocessing step to attach non-paired punctuations to their left neighbouring words
p34
aVIn our method, punctuations are treated as properties of its neighbouring words
p35
aVIn this method, punctuations are not associated with lexical heads, but are treated as properties of their neighbouring words
p36
aVBefore parsing starts, a preprocessing step is used to first attach the paired punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words, and then remove them from the sentence
p37
aVRow 4 and row 5 list accuracies of punctuations (all excluding words) on the development and test set, respectively
p38
aVOur first experiment is to investigate the effect of processing paired punctuations on parsing accuracy
p39
aVIn this section, we conduct a set of experiments to show the influence of punctuations on dependency parsing accuracies
p40
aVResults are listed in the fourth column of Table 4, which shows that parsing accuracies can be further improved by also processing non-paired punctuations
p41
aVTo see this, we divide the sentences in the development set into sub-sets according the punctuation ratio (percentage of punctuations that a sentence contains), and then evaluate parsing accuracies on the sub-sets separately
p42
aVIt is guaranteed that the property of the left neighbouring words of non-paired punctuations must be empty
p43
aVHowever, a related problem is that parsing accuracy on words tends to drop on the sentences which contain high ratio of punctuations
p44
aVWhen Bpunc s and Epunc s meet each other at w h , a Paired property is assigned to w h to capture that the words within the paired punctuations form a sub-tree, rooted at w h
p45
aVIn addition to the features designed for paired punctuations, such as bigram punctuation features listed in line 3 of Table 3, we also design features for non-paired punctuations
p46
aVIn this experiment, the method introduced in Section 3.1 is used to process paired punctuations, and the non-paired punctuations are left un-touched
p47
aVOur first experiment is to show that, compared with words, punctuations are more difficult to parse and to learn
p48
aVThe characteristics of paired punctuations include
p49
aVIn the last experiment, we examine the effect of incorporating all punctuations using the method introduced in Section 2
p50
aVHowever, the UAS on punctuations are generally below 85 u'\u005cu2062' %
p51
aVModern statistical parsers [ 8 , 10 , 5 , 14 ] treat all the tokens equally, assigning lexical heads to punctuations as well as words
p52
aVDuring parsing, non-paired punctuations are also passed bottom-up the property of w h is updated by its right -most dependent to keep track whether there is a punctuation to the right side of the tree rooted at w h
p53
aVTo show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology the open source MSTParser 1 1 We trained a second order labelled parser with all the configurations set to the default value
p54
aVA natural question is whether it is possible to reduce such error propagation by simply removing all punctuations from parsing
p55
aVDuring parsing, when a dependency arc with lexical head w h is created, the property of w h is updated by the property of its left (or right) most child to keep track whether there is a Bpunc (or Epunc ) to the left (or right) side of the sub-tree rooted at w h , as shown in Figure 1 (c
p56
aVWe re-train the parsers on the modified training set and evaluate parsing accuracies on the modified data
p57
aVWe can see that when the beam width is set to 1, our method achieves an 0.49 UAS improvement
p58
aVHowever, such information might be inaccurate when the verb u'\u005cu2019' s modifiers contain punctuations
p59
aVHowever, there are a number of reasons that it is not necessary to parse punctuations
p60
aVIn addition, punctuations cause certain type of features inaccurate
p61
aVHere paired punctuations include brackets and quotations marks, whose Penn Treebank POS tags are the following four
p62
aVFeature templates used in this experiment are those listed in the top three rows of Table 3 together with those used for the baseline arc-standard parser
p63
aVThe first is that our method is able to capture the pattern that there is only one dependency arc between the words within the paired-punctuations and the words outside, while the baseline parser sometimes creates more dependency arcs that cross the boundary
p64
aVExperiments show that our method achieves about 0.90 u'\u005cu2062' % UAS improvement over the greedy baseline parser on the standard Penn Treebank test set
p65
aVIn this experiment, we use all the feature templates in Table 3 and those in the baseline parser
p66
aVParsing accuracy is evaluated using unlabelled attachment score (UAS), which is the percentage of words that are assigned the correct lexical heads
p67
aVThe final results on the test set are listed in Table 5 5 5 The number of training iteration is determined using the development set
p68
aVResults on the development set are shown in the second column of Table 4
p69
aVWe can see that most of the cases, parsing accuracies drop on sentences with higher punctuation ratios
p70
aVWe design a set of features to exploit the potential of using punctuation properties for the arc-standard parser
p71
aVThough some types of non-paired punctuations may capture certain syntactic patterns, we do not make further distinctions between them, and treat these punctuations uniformly for simplicity
p72
aVThe code is publicly available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mstparser/ [ 9 ] , our own re-implementation of an arc-standard transition-based parser [ 11 ] , which is trained using global learning and beam-search [ 13 ] with a rich feature set [ 14 ] 2 2 Some feature templates in Zhang and Nivre ( 2011 ) involve head word and head POS tags which are not available for an arc-standard parser
p73
aVResults are listed in row 6 and row 7 of Table 1
p74
aVOtherwise, it means the non-paired punctuation is adjacent to a paired punctuation
p75
aVNote that in Figure 1 (a), the left neighbour of u'\u005cu201d' is also a punctuation
p76
aVFor example, modern statistical parsers achieve above 90 u'\u005cu2062' % unlabelled attachment score (UAS) on words
p77
aVPunctuations arguably play an important role in syntactic analysis
p78
aVIn particular, we attach Bpunc s to their right neighbours and Epunc s to their left neighbours, as shown in Figure 1 (b
p79
aVTable 5 also lists the accuracies of state-of-the-art transition-based parsers
p80
aV1) they typically exist in pairs; (2) they serve as boundaries that there is only one dependency arc between the words inside the boundaries and the words outside
p81
aVTake the sentence in Figure 1 (a) for example, the only arc cross the boundary is (Mechanisms, entitled) where entitled is the head
p82
aVIn other words, they are not adjacent
p83
aVWe can see that our method achieves the best accuracy for single-model transition-based parsers
p84
aVWe incorporate our method into the arc-standard transition-based parser, which uses a stack u'\u005cu03a3' to maintain partially constructed trees and a buffer u'\u005cu0392' for the incoming words [ 11 ]
p85
aVTake valency features for example, previous work [ 14 ] has shown that such features are important to parsing accuracy, e.g.,, it may inform the parser that a verb already has two objects attached to it
p86
aVInterestingly, without those features our arc-standard parser still achieves 92.84 u'\u005cu2062' % UAS which is comparable to the 92.90 u'\u005cu2062' % UAS obtained by the arc-eager parser of Zhang and Nivre ( 2011 ) , and our own re-implementation of the easy-first parser [ 4 ] with an extended feature set [ 7 ]
p87
aVThe results are listed in Table 2
p88
aVThe feature templates are listed in Table 3
p89
aVGiven the above reasons, we propose an alternative approach to punctuation processing for dependency parsing
p90
aVIn the example, we set two flags u'\u005cu201c' and ( on the word Congrees u'\u005cu2019' s
p91
aVThe task of dependency parsing is to identify the lexical head of each of the tokens in a string
p92
aVThe overall accuracy improvement when the beam width is 1 reaches 0.91 u'\u005cu2062' %
p93
aVThe Paired property is assigned only when all the flags are turned off
p94
aVWe can see that parsing accuracies on the modified data drop significantly compared with that on the original data
p95
aVIn this work, we report results on an arc-standard transition-based parser
p96
aVUltimately, it is the dependencies between words that provide useful information for real world applications
p97
aVBy comparing the outputs of the two parsers, two types of errors made by the baseline parser are effectively corrected
p98
aVSee Figure 1 (d
p99
aVOur method is simple and can be easily incorporated into state-of-the-art parsers
p100
aVIn such cases, the non-paired punctuation would be removed in the first processing step
p101
aVIn our implementation, Bpunc or Epunc properties are implemented using flags
p102
aVWhen Bpunc and Epunc meet each other, the corresponding flags are turned off
p103
aVTraining set POS tags are generated using 10-fold jack-knifing

p105
aVThe extra improvements mainly come from better accuracies on the sentences with comma
p106
aVIn particular, u'\u005cu201c' Huang 10 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' Zhang 11 u'\u005cu201d' denote Huang and Sagae ( 2010 ) and Zhang and Nivre ( 2011 ) , respectively u'\u005cu201c' Bohnet 12 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' Choi 13 u'\u005cu201d' denote Bohnet and Nivre ( 2012 ) and Choi and Mccallum ( 2013 ) , respectively
p107
aVWe use our own implementation of the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger proposed by Collins ( 2002 ) to tag the development and test sets
p108
aVOur next experiment aims at answering this question
p109
aVTake machine translation or information extraction for example, most systems take advantage of the head-modifier relationships between word pairs rather than word-punctuation pairs to make better predictions
p110
aVIt is not uncommon that two Bpuncs appear adjacent to each other
