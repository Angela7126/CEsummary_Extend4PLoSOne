VHowever, other resources such as Wiktionary do not provide semantic relations between concepts and, therefore, have first to be transformed into semantic networks before they can be aligned using our alignment algorithm
p1
aVIn the definitional similarity component, the two concepts c 1 and c 2 are first represented by their corresponding definitions d 1 and d 2 in the respective resources L 1 and L 2 (Figure 1 (a), top

aVAlgorithm 2 formalizes the alignment process the algorithm takes as input the semantic graphs G 1 and G 2 corresponding to the two resources, as explained above, and produces as output an alignment in the form of a set A of concept pairs
p3
aVIn the structural similarity component (Figure 1 (b), bottom), the semantic signature for each concept c i is computed by running the ppr algorithm on its corresponding graph G i , hence a different u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc0c' i is built for each of the two concepts
