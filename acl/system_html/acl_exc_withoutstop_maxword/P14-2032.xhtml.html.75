<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Dual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This penalty exchange is similar to message passing, and as the penalty accumulates over iterations, the two models are pushed towards agreeing with each other</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct</a>
