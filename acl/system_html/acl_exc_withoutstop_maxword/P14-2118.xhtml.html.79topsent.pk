VWe therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u005cu2018' pure u'\u005cu2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives
p1
aVTo verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al
p2
aVWe evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks
p3
aVWe consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the frequency of occurrence as the leftmost of two adjectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings
p4
aVUnlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ]
p5
aVWe thus define adverbiability as the frequency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g
p6
aV1985 ) theorizes that subjective adjectives tend to develop derived adverbial forms, whereas more objective adjectives do not
p7
aVIn addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p8
aVWe thus define comparability as the frequency of comparative or superlative forms relative to the frequency of the base form, e.g
p9
aVWe therefore extract the relative frequency of
