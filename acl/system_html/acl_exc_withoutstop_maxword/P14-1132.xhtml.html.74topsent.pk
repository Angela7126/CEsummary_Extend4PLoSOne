VWe show that the induced cross-modal semantic space is powerful enough that sensible guesses about the correct word denoting an object can be made, even when the linguistic context vector representing the word has been created from as little as 1 sentence containing it
p1
aVWhereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations
p2
aVThe process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u005cu2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space
p3
aVWhen the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object
p4
aVMoreover, once the learner observes a new object, she can easily construct a full visual representation for it (and the acquisition literature has shown that humans are wired for good object segmentation and recognition [ 50 ] ) u'\u005cu2013' the more challenging task is to scan the ongoing and very ambiguous linguistic communication for contexts that might be relevant and informative about the new object
p5
aVFor ESP, given the size and amount of noise in this dataset, we build vectors for visual concepts , by normalizing and summing the BoVW vectors of all the images that have the relevant concept as a tag
p6
aVThis is achieved by means of a simple neural network trained to project image-extracted feature vectors to text-based vectors through a hidden layer that can be interpreted as a cross-modal semantic space
