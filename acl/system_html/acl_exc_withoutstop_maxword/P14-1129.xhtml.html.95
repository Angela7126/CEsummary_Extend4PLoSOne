<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One issue with the S2T NNJM is that the probability is computed over every target word, so it does not explicitly model NULL-aligned source words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The decoding cost is based on a measurement of u'\u223c' 1200 unique NNJM lookups per source word for our Arabic-English system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, for every word in the vocabulary, and for each position, we can pre-compute the dot product between the word embedding and the first hidden layer</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, the total cost increase of using the NNJM+NNLTM features in decoding is only u'\u223c' 0.01 seconds per source word</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, note that there are only 3 possible positions for each target word, and 11 for each source word</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For the sake of a fair comparison, these all use one hidden layer</a>
