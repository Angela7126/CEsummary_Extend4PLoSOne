VWe wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique
p1
aVHowever, saccade duration is not significant for annotation of short text, as in our case
p2
aVTo measure the u'\u005cu201c' actual u'\u005cu201d' time spent by an annotator on a piece of text, we use an eye-tracker to record eye-fixation duration the time for which the annotator has actually focused on the sentence during annotation
p3
aVThe next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity
p4
aVUsing the idea of u'\u005cu201c' annotation time u'\u005cu201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC
p5
aVWith regard to this, we introduce a metric called sentiment annotation complexity (SAC
p6
aVHowever, u'\u005cu201c' simple time measurement u'\u005cu201d' is not reliable because the annotator may spend time not doing any annotation due to fatigue or distraction
p7
aVTo understand how the formula records sentiment annotation complexity, consider the SACs of examples in section 2
p8
aVMeasuring annotation complexity is beneficial in annotation crowdsourcing
p9
aVOur proposed metric measures complexity of sentiment annotation, as perceived by human annotators
p10
aVThe simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level
