<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We conducted an Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) evaluation where AMT workers compared the output of Summa to that of timelines and flat summaries</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, descriptions from both Summa and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since Summa was judged to be so much superior to flat MDS systems in Section 5.1 , it is surprising that users descriptions from flat MDS were preferred nearly as often as those from Summa</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>After the sentences are clustered, we have a structure for the hierarchical summary that dictates the number of summaries and the number</a>
