<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our string transduction model works by learning the sequence of edits which transform the input string into the output string</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Once trained the model is used to label new strings and the predicted edit script is applied to the input string producing the normalized output string</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When run on new strings, the activations of the units in the hidden layer at each position in the string are recorded and used as features for training the string transduction model</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The units in the hidden layer at time t receive connections from input units at time t and also from the hidden units at the previous time step t - 1</a>
