<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The events extracted in the baseline are represented as a 3-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , k u'\u27e9' 5 5 TwiCal also groups event instances into event types such as u'\u201d' Sport u'\u201d' or u'\u201d' Politics u'\u201d' using LinkLDA which is not considered here where y stands for a non-location named entity, d for a date and k for an event phrase</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this model, we assume that each tweet message m u'\u2208' { 1 u'\u2062' M } is assigned to one event instance e , while e is modeled as a joint distribution over the named entities y , the date/time d when the event occurred, the location l where the event occurred and the event-related keywords k</a>
