(lp0
VWe treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token
p1
aVOne issue with the S2T NNJM is that the probability is computed over every target word, so it does not explicitly model NULL-aligned source words
p2
aVThe decoding cost is based on a measurement of u'\u005cu223c' 1200 unique NNJM lookups per source word for our Arabic-English system
p3
aVTherefore, for every word in the vocabulary, and for each position, we can pre-compute the dot product between the word embedding and the first hidden layer
p4
aVFor aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule
p5
aVThus, the total cost increase of using the NNJM+NNLTM features in decoding is only u'\u005cu223c' 0.01 seconds per source word
p6
aVHowever, note that there are only 3 possible positions for each target word, and 11 for each source word
p7
aVFor the sake of a fair comparison, these all use one hidden layer
p8
aVFor unaligned words, the normal heuristic can also be used, except when the word is on the edge of a rule, because then the target neighbor words are not necessarily known
p9
aVIt is easy and computationally inexpensive to use this model in decoding, since only one neural network computation must be made for each source word
p10
aVThis leads to a total improvement of +3.0 BLEU from the NNJM and its variations
p11
aVSpecifically, if unaligned target word t is on the right edge of an arc that covers source span [ s i , s j ] , we simply say that t is affiliated with source word s j
p12
aVWe chose these values for the hidden layer size, vocabulary size, and source window size because they seemed to work best on our data sets u'\u005cu2013' larger sizes did not improve results, while smaller sizes degraded results
p13
aVTo do this, we first say that each target word t i is affiliated with exactly one source word at index a i u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' i is then the m -word source window centered at a i
p14
aVWhen used as MT decoding features, these models are able to produce a gain of +3.0 BLEU on top of a very strong and feature-rich baseline, as well as a +6.3 BLEU gain on top of a simpler system
p15
aVOn Arabic-English, the primary S2T/L2R NNJM gains +1.4 BLEU on top of our baseline, while the S2T NNLTM gains another +0.8, and the directional variations gain +0.8 BLEU more
p16
aVThis can be reduced to just 5 scalar additions by pre-summing each 11-word source window when starting a test sentence
p17
aVIf t i is unaligned, we inherit its affiliation from the closest aligned word, with preference given to the right
p18
aVHere, we present a u'\u005cu201c' trick u'\u005cu201d' for pre-computing the first hidden layer, which further increases the speed of NNJM lookups by a factor of 1,000x
p19
aVAdditionally, on top of a simpler decoder equivalent to Chiang u'\u005cu2019' s [ 5 ] original Hiero implementation, our NNJM features are able to produce an improvement of +6.3 BLEU u'\u005cu2013' as much as all of the other features in our strong baseline system combined
p20
aVBecause our NNJM is fundamentally an n -gram NNLM with additional source context, it can easily be integrated into any SMT decoder
p21
aVHere, our goal is to be able to use a fairly large vocabulary without word classes, and to simply avoid computing the entire output layer at decode time
p22
aVIf our neural network has only one hidden layer and is self-normalized, the only remaining computation is 512 calls to t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' ( ) and a single 513-dimensional dot product for the final output score
p23
aVOn Arabic, the total gain is +2.6 BLEU, while on Chinese, the gain is +1.3 BLEU
p24
aVThe T2S variations cannot be used in decoding due to the large target context required, and are thus only used in k -best rescoring
p25
aVHowever, the n -grams created for the NNJM can be shared with the Kneser-Ney LM, which reduces the cost of that feature
p26
aVWe have described a novel formulation for a neural network-based machine translation joint model, along with several simple variations of this model
p27
aVWe also present a novel technique for training the neural network to be self-normalized , which avoids the costly step of posteriorizing over the entire vocabulary in decoding
p28
aVHowever, we have demonstrated that we can obtain 50%-80% of the total improvement with only one model (S2T/L2R NNJM), and 70%-90% with only two models (S2T/L2R NNJM + S2T NNLTM
p29
aVIf t is on the left edge of the arc, we say it is affiliated with s i
p30
aVFor the sake of speed, these experiments only use the S2T/L2R NNJM+S2T NNLTM
p31
aVAlso, their model is recurrent, so it cannot be used in decoding
p32
aVHowever, Le u'\u005cu2019' s formulation could only be used in k -best rescoring, since it requires long-distance re-ordering and a large target context
p33
aVThe smaller improvement on Chinese-English compared to Arabic-English is consistent with the behavior of our baseline features, as we show in the next section
p34
aVA number of recent papers have proposed methods for creating neural network translation/joint models, but nearly all of these works have obtained much smaller BLEU improvements than ours
p35
aVThus, only u'\u005cu223c' 3500 arithmetic operations are required per n -gram lookup, compared to u'\u005cu223c' 2.8M for self-normalized NNJM without pre-computation, and u'\u005cu223c' 35M for the standard NNJM
p36
aV12 12 Note that the official 1st place OpenMT12 result was our own system, so we can assure that these comparisons are accurate
p37
aV13 13 The difference in score for self-normalized vs pre-computed is entirely due to two vs one hidden layers
p38
aVThe vocabulary is selected by frequency-sorting the words in the parallel training data
p39
aVBecause of this, the baseline BLEU scores are much higher than a typical MT system u'\u005cu2013' especially a real-time, production engine which must support many language pairs
p40
aVAlthough we consider the RNNLM to be part of our baseline, we give it special treatment in the results section because we would expect it to have the highest overlap with our NNJM
p41
aVThe use of a large bilingual context vector, which is provided to the neural network in u'\u005cu201c' raw u'\u005cu201d' form, rather than as the output of some other algorithm
p42
aVThe baseline here uses the same feature set as the strong NIST system
p43
aVTherefore, we also present results using a simpler version of our decoder which emulates Chiang u'\u005cu2019' s original Hiero implementation [ 5 ]
p44
aVThe baseline used in the last section is a highly-engineered research system, which uses a wide array of features that were refined over a number of years, and some of which require linguistic resources
p45
aVWhile we cannot train a neural network with this guarantee, we can explicitly encourage the log-softmax normalizer to be as close to 0 as possible by augmenting our training objective function
p46
aVThe fact that the model is purely lexicalized, which avoids both data sparsity and implementation complexity
p47
aVThey score a 1000-best list using only their model and are able to achieve the same BLEU as using all 12 standard MT features (21.8 vs 21.7
p48
aVThe S2T/R2L variant could be used in decoding, but we have not found this beneficial, so we only use it in rescoring
p49
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' Simple Hierarchical u'\u005cu201d' baseline is used here because it more closely approximates a real-time MT engine
p50
aV2012 ) require a 2-20k shortlist vocabulary, and are therefore still quite costly
p51
aVOut-of-vocabulary words are mapped to their POS tag (or OOV , if POS is not available), and in this case P ( P O S i t i - 1 , u'\u005cu22ef' ) is used directly without further normalization
p52
aV4 4 We are not concerned with speeding up training time, as we already find GPU training time to be adequate
p53
aVWe also show strong improvements on the NIST OpenMT12 Chinese-English task, as well as the DARPA BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) Arabic-English and Chinese-English conditions
p54
aVHowever, additive results are not presented
p55
aVBy combining self-normalization and pre-computation, we can achieve a speed of 1.4M lookups/second, which is on par with fast back-off LM implementations [ 27 ]
p56
aVThus, the one and two-model conditions still significantly outperform any past work
p57
aVIf we could guarantee that log u'\u005cu2061' ( Z u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) ) were always equal to 0 (i.e.,, Z u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) = 1) then at decode time we would only have to compute row r of the output layer instead of the whole matrix
p58
aVAt decode time, we simply use U r u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) as the feature score, rather than log u'\u005cu2061' ( P u'\u005cu2062' ( x )
p59
aVThey have since been extended to translation modeling, parsing, and many other NLP tasks
p60
aV6 6 t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h u'\u005cu2062' ( ) is implemented using a lookup table
p61
aVIntuitively, we want to define u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' i as the window that is most relevant to t i
p62
aVAt every epoch, which we define as 20,000 minibatches, the likelihood of a validation set is computed
p63
aVIf this likelihood is worse than the previous epoch, the learning rate is multiplied by 0.5
p64
aVSpecifically, we introduce a novel formulation for a neural network joint model (NNJM), which augments an n -gram target language model with an m -word source window
p65
aVComputing the first hidden layer now only requires 15 scalar additions for each of the 512 hidden rows u'\u005cu2013' one for each word in the input vector, plus the bias
p66
aVAll previous results use a self-normalized neural network with two hidden layers
p67
aVIn order to assign a probability to every source word during decoding, we also train a neural network lexical translation model (NNLMT
p68
aVIn Table 2 we showed that the cost of unique lookups for the pre-computed NNJM is only u'\u005cu223c' 0.001 seconds per source word
p69
aVThe probability is computed over every source word in the input sentence
p70
aVA second hidden layer adds 0.5M floating point operations
p71
aVThis notion of affiliation is derived from the word alignment, but unlike word alignment, each target word must be affiliated with exactly one non-NULL source word
p72
aVThe input vector is a 14-word context vector (3 target words, 11 source words), where each word is mapped to a 192-dimensional vector using a shared mapping layer
p73
aVFor the neural network described in Section 2.1 , computing the first hidden layer requires multiplying a 2689 -dimensional input vector 5 5 2689 = 14 words × 192 dimensions + 1 bias with a 2689 × 512 dimensional hidden layer matrix
p74
aVThe input vocabulary contains 16,000 source words and 16,000 target words, while the output vocabulary contains 32,000 target words
p75
aVFor Chinese-English, the u'\u005cu201c' Simple Hierarchical u'\u005cu201d' system only degrades by -3.2 BLEU compared to our strongest baseline, and the NNJM features produce a gain of +2.1 BLEU on top of that
p76
aVIn Table 7 , we compare this to using a standard network (with two hidden layers), as well as a pre-computed neural network
p77
aVWe follow the standard n -gram LM decomposition of the target, where each target word t i is conditioned on the previous n - 1 target words
p78
aVWe demonstrate in Section 6.6 that using the self-normalized/pre-computed NNJM results in only a very small BLEU degradation compared to the standard NNJM
p79
aVIn rescoring, we also use a T2S NNLTM model computed over every target word
p80
aVThe NNJM features produce an improvement of +3.0 BLEU on top of a baseline that is already better than the 1st place MT12 result and includes a powerful NNLM
p81
aVThis does not include the cost of n -gram creation or cached lookups, which amount to u'\u005cu223c' 0.03 seconds per source word in our current implementation
p82
aVFormally, our model approximates the probability of target hypothesis T conditioned on source sentence S
p83
aVIn this paper we use a basic neural network architecture and a lexicalized probability model to create a powerful MT decoding feature
p84
aVThe output layer is a softmax over the entire output vocabulary
p85
aVWe can see that going from the standard model to the pre-computed model only reduces the BLEU improvement from +6.4 to +6.1, while increasing the NNJM lookup speed by a factor of 10,000x
p86
aVRecurrent neural network language model (RNNLM) [ 16 ]
p87
aVThe gain from the decoding NNJM is large in both cases (+2.6 BLEU w/o RNNLM, +1.6 BLEU w/ RNNLM
p88
aVWhen used in conjunction with a pre-computed hidden layer, these techniques speed up NNJM computation by a factor of 10,000x, with only a small reduction on MT accuracy
p89
aVWe demonstrate in Section 6.6 that using one hidden layer instead of two has minimal effect on BLEU
p90
aVHere, we extend the state space to also include the index of the affiliated source word for these edge words
p91
aVWe can see that reducing the source window size, layer size, or vocab size will all degrade results
p92
aVThe computational cost of NNLMs is a significant issue in decoding, and this cost is dominated by the output softmax over the entire target vocabulary
p93
aVFor the Chinese-English condition, there is an improvement of +0.8 BLEU from the primary NNJM and +1.3 BLEU overall
p94
aVTable 1 shows the neural network training results with various values of the free parameter u'\u005cu0391'
p95
aVwhere x is the sample, U is the raw output layer scores, r is the output layer row corresponding to the observed target word, and Z u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) is the softmax normalizer
p96
aVNote that this technique only results in a significant speedup for self-normalized, feed-forward, NNLM-style networks with one hidden layer
p97
aVResults are shown in the second section of Table 3
p98
aVResults are shown in Table 4
p99
aVResults are shown in the third section of Table 3
p100
aVAdditionally, we present several variations of this model which provide significant additive BLEU gains
p101
aVOur short term ideas include using more interesting types of context in our input vector (such as source syntax), or using the NNJM to model syntactic/semantic structure of the target
p102
aVWhen the NNJM features are added to this system, we see an improvement of +6.3 BLEU, which would have ranked 1st place in the evaluation
p103
aVWe can see that the rescoring-only NNJM performs very well when used on top of a baseline without an RNNLM (+1.5 BLEU), but the gain on top of the RNNLM is very small (+0.3 BLEU
p104
aVTable 5 shows performance when our S2T/L2R NNJM is used only in 1000-best rescoring, compared to decoding
p105
aVTable 2 shows the speed of self-normalization and pre-computation for the NNJM
p106
aVTable 6 shows results using the S2T/L2R NNJM with various configurations
p107
aVFor our NNJM architecture, self-normalization increases the lookup speed during decoding by a factor of u'\u005cu223c' 15x

aVIf t i aligns to exactly one source word, a i is the index of the word it aligns to

aV1) rule probabilities, (2) n -gram Kneser-Ney LM, (3) lexical smoothing, (4) target word count, (5) concat rule penalty
p110
aVIf t i align to multiple source words, a i is the index of the aligned word in the middle
p111
aVLe u'\u005cu2019' s model does obtain an impressive +1.7 BLEU gain on top of a baseline without an NNLM (25.8 vs
p112
aVThen, he predicts each target word given the previous bilingual phrases
p113
aVAlthough our model is quite simple, we obtain strong empirical results
p114
aVIn this case, the output layer bias weights are initialized to log u'\u005cu2061' ( 1 /
p115
aVOur baseline decoder contains a large and powerful set of features, which include
p116
aVThese are computed offline and stored in a lookup table, which is 500MB in size
p117
aVThe large size of the network architecture
p118
aVInitially, these models were primarily used to create n -gram neural network language models (NNLMs) for speech recognition and machine translation [ 2 , 23 ]
p119
aVHere, the baseline system is already +0.8 BLEU better than the best MT12 system
p120
aVAn example of the NNJM context model for a Chinese-English parallel sentence is given in Figure 1
p121
aVConsidering that our baseline is already +0.3 BLEU better than the 1st place result of MT12 and contains a strong RNNLM, we consider this to be quite an extraordinary improvement
p122
aVAlthough self-normalization significantly improves the speed of NNJM lookups, the model is still several orders of magnitude slower than a back-off LM
p123
aVTo make this a joint model, we also condition on source context vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' i
p124
aV14 14 In our decoder, roughly 95% of NNJM n -gram lookups within the same sentence are duplicates
p125
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' Simple Hierarchical u'\u005cu201d' Arabic-English system is -6.4 BLEU worse than our strong baseline, and would have ranked 10th place out of 11 systems in the evaluation
p126
aVFormally, the probability model is
p127
aVThe ability to use the NNJM in decoding rather than rescoring
p128
aVHere, the input context is the 11-word source window centered at s i , and the output is the target token t s i which s i aligns to
p129
aVEffectively, this means that for Arabic-English, the NNJM features are equivalent to the combined improvements from the string-to-dependency model plus all of the features listed in Section 5.1
p130
aVFor example, creating a new type of decoder centered around a purely lexicalized neural network model
p131
aVTo do this, we present the novel technique of self-normalization , where the output layer scores are close to being probabilities without explicitly performing a softmax
p132
aVHowever, when compared to the strongest baseline which includes an NNLM, Le u'\u005cu2019' s best models (S2T + T2S) only obtain an +0.6 BLEU improvement (26.9 vs
p133
aVThis model is trained and evaluated like our NNJM
p134
aVEach result from Table 7 corresponds to a row in Table 2 of Section 2.4
p135
aVSchwenk ( 2012 ) predicts an entire target phrase at a time, rather than a word at a time
p136
aVAlso note that the target-only NNLM (i.e.,, Source Window=0) only obtains 33% of the improvements of the NNJM
p137
aVIn recent years, neural network models have become increasingly popular in NLP
p138
aVFortunately, neural network language models are able to elegantly scale up and take advantage of arbitrarily large context sizes
p139
aVOur NIST system is fully compatible with the OpenMT12 constrained track, which consists of 10M words of high-quality parallel training for Arabic, and 25M words for Chinese
p140
aVThey obtain +0.2 BLEU improvement on top of a target-only NNLM (25.6 vs
p141
aVWe also train a separate lower-order n -gram model, which is necessary to compute estimate scores during hierarchical decoding
p142
aVwhere x i is the training sample, with one sample for every target word in the parallel corpus
p143
aVIn this section, we describe the MT system used in our experiments
p144
aVWe present MT primary results on Arabic-English and Chinese-English for the NIST OpenMT12 and DARPA BOLT conditions
p145
aVWe should note that our best results use six separate models, whereas all previous work only uses one or two models
p146
aVThe training data ranges from 10-30M words, depending on the condition
p147
aVUnlike previous approaches to joint modeling [ 13 ] , our feature can be easily integrated into any statistical machine translation (SMT) decoder, which leads to substantially larger improvements than k -best rescoring only
p148
aVIn this section, we describe the considerations that must be taken when integrating the NNJM into a hierarchical decoder
p149
aVTraining is performed on a single Tesla K10 GPU, with each epoch (128*20k = 2.6M samples) taking roughly 1100 seconds to run, resulting in a total training time of u'\u005cu223c' 12 hours
p150
aVLe u'\u005cu2019' s basic procedure is to re-order the source to match the linear order of the target, and then segment the hypothesis into minimal bilingual phrase pairs
p151
aVWe show primary results on the NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English condition
p152
aVRecall that our NNJM feature can be described with the following probability
p153
aV8 8 This does not include the cost of duplicate lookups within the same test sentence, which are cached
p154
aVWhen performing hierarchical decoding with an n -gram LM, the leftmost and rightmost n - 1 words from each constituent must be stored in the state space
p155
aVKalchbrenner and Blunsom ( 2013 ) implement a convolutional recurrent NNJM
p156
aVWe also present a set of auxiliary results in order to further analyze our features
p157
aVFormally, we define the standard softmax log likelihood as
p158
aVThe BOLT parallel training consists of all of the high-quality NIST training, plus an additional 3 million words of translated forum data provided by LDC
p159
aVIn this case, we infer the affiliation from the rule structure
p160
aVFor word alignment, we align all of the training data with both GIZA++ [ 18 ] and NILE [ 20 ] , and concatenate the corpora together for rule extraction
p161
aVThey obtain an +0.5 BLEU improvement on Chinese-English (30.0 vs
p162
aVHe obtains +0.3 BLEU improvement (24.8 vs
p163
aVOut-of-bounds words are represented with special tokens src , /src , trg , /trg
p164
aVIt is clear that this model is effectively an ( n + m ) -gram LM, and a 15-gram LM would be far too sparse for standard probability models such as Kneser-Ney back-off [ 12 ] or Maximum Entropy [ 21 ]
p165
aVWe use an initial learning rate of 10 - 3 and a minibatch size of 128
p166
aVLe u'\u005cu2019' s model also uses minimal phrases rather than being purely lexicalized, which has two main downsides a) a number of complex, hand-crafted heuristics are required to define phrase boundaries, which may not transfer well to new languages, (b) the effective vocabulary size is much larger, which substantially increases data sparsity issues
p167
aVSpecifically, this means that we don u'\u005cu2019' t use dependency-based rule extraction, and our decoder only contains the following MT features
p168
aVOur neural network architecture is almost identical to the original feed-forward NNLM architecture described in Bengio et al
p169
aVThe affiliation heuristic is very simple
p170
aV, so that the initial network is self-normalized
p171
aVThis demonstrates that the full power of the NNJM can only be harnessed when it is used in decoding

p176
aVOptimization is performed using standard back propagation with stochastic gradient ascent [ 14 ]
p177
aVOur model is remarkably simple u'\u005cu2013' it requires no linguistic resources, no feature engineering, and only a handful of hyper-parameters
p178
aVThe primary purpose of this is as a comparison to Le et al
p179
aVWe use two 512-dimensional hidden layers with t u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' h activation functions
p180
aV2 2 We have found that the affiliation heuristic is robust to small differences, such as left vs right preference
p181
aVOne of the biggest goals of this work is to quell any remaining doubts about the utility of neural networks in machine translation
p182
aVAlthough NCE results in faster training time, it has the downside that there is no mechanism to control the degree of self-normalization
p183
aVDecoding is performed on a CPU
p184
aVFor each related paper, we will briefly contrast their methodology with our own and summarize their BLEU improvements using scores taken directly from the cited paper
p185
aVThis is consistent with our rescoring-only result, which indicates that k -best rescoring is too shallow to take advantage of the power of a joint model
p186
aVHowever, not only are these techniques intractable to train with high-order context vectors, they also lack the neural network u'\u005cu2019' s ability to semantically generalize [ 17 ] and learn non-linear relationships

aVThe directional variation models
p199
aVBy contrast, our u'\u005cu0391' parameter allows us to carefully choose the optimal trade-off between neural network accuracy and mean self-normalization error
p200
aVFor test, we use the u'\u005cu201c' Arabic-To-English Original Progress Test u'\u005cu201d' (1378 segments) and u'\u005cu201c' Chinese-to-English Original Progress Test + OpenMT12 Current Test u'\u005cu201d' (2190 segments), which consists of a mix of newswire and web data
p201
aVFor MT feature weight optimization, we use iterative k -best optimization with an ExpectedBLEU objective function [ 22 ]
p202
aVHowever, we have found it beneficial to clip each weight update to the range of [-0.1, 0.1], to prevent the training from entering degenerate search spaces [ 19 ]
p203
aVThe training is run for 40 epochs
p204
aVIt also has no reliance on potentially fragile outside algorithms, such as unsupervised word clustering
p205
