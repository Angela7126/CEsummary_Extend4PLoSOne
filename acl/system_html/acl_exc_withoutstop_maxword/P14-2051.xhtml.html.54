<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On the reasonable assumption that the semantic contribution of the construction did not change, and therefore that all verbs ever attested in it are equally plausible from a semantic point of view, the fact that some verbs joined the distribution later than others is in want of an explanation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These finding support the view that semantic density and type frequency, while they both positively influence syntactic productivity, do so in different ways density defines the necessary conditions for a new coinage to occur, while type frequency increases the confidence that this coinage is indeed possible</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This measure of density was used as a factor in logistic regression to predict the first occurrence of a verb in the construction, coded as the binary variable Occurrence , set to 1 for the first period in which the verb</a>
