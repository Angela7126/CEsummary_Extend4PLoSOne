VBased on the results obtained by , who showed that the keyword method results in better long-term word retention than rote memorization, we would expect the error rate reduction to be even higher in a delayed post-test

aVInterestingly, there is a strong correlation (Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s r = 0.85 ) between the difficulty of the words in each group (measured as the error rate on rote memorization) and the positive contribution of the generated sentences to the learning process

aV1) Keywords with a smaller orthographic/phonetic distance are preferred; 2) Keywords consisting of a single word are preferred over two words (e.g.,, for the target word lavagna , which means blackboard , lasagna takes precedence over love and onion ); 3) Keywords that do not contain stop words are preferred (e.g.,, for the target word pettine , which means comb , the keyword pair pet and inn is ranked higher than pet and in , since in is a
