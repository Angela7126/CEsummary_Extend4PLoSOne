<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The IBM Model 1 learning process uses an internal EM approach where the E-step estimates the alignment vector for each problem word; this vector indicates the distribution of alignments of the problem word across the solution words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>All solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We propose a clustering based approach so as to cluster each of the ( p , r ) pairs into either the solution cluster or the non-solution cluster</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For simplicity and brevity, instead of deriving the EM formulation, we illustrate our approach by making an analogy with the popular K-Means clustering [ 13 ] algorithm that also uses the EM formulation and crisp assignments of data points like we do</a>
