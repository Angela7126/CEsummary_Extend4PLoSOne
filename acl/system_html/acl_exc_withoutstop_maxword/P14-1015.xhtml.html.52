<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Having exhausted the two obvious textual features for solution identification, subsequent approaches have largely used the presence of lexical cues signifying solution-like narrative (e.g.,, instructive narratives such as u'\u201d' check the router for any connection issues u'\u201d' ) as the primary content-based feature for solution identification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Though more data always tends to be beneficial since statistical models benefit from redundancy, the marginal utility of additional data drops to very small levels beyond a point; we are interested in the amount of data beyond which the quality of solution identification flattens out</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Typical response posts include solutions or clarification requests, whereas feedback posts form another major category of forum posts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For simplicity and brevity, instead of deriving the EM formulation, we illustrate our approach by making an analogy with the popular K-Means clustering [ 13 ] algorithm that also uses the EM formulation and crisp assignments of data points like we do</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The IBM Model 1 learning process uses an internal EM approach where the E-step estimates the alignment vector for each problem word; this vector indicates the distribution of alignments of the problem word across the solution words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Being supervised methods, the above assumptions are implicitly factored in by including the appropriate feature (e.g.,, post position in thread) in the feature space so that the learner may</a>
