VWe evaluate feature representation projection on the task of dependency-based semantic role labeling (SRL) []
p1
aVInstead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data
p2
aVOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p3
aVThe approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the
