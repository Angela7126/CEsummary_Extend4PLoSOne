VMeasuring annotation complexity is beneficial in annotation crowdsourcing
p1
aVThe next level of sentiment annotation complexity arises due to syntactic complexity
p2
aVFort et al2012 describe the necessity of annotation complexity measurement in manual annotation tasks
p3
aVWith regard to this, we introduce a metric called sentiment annotation complexity (SAC
p4
aVWe wish to predict sentiment annotation complexity of the text using a supervised technique
p5
aVThe simplest form of sentiment annotation complexity is at the lexical level
p6
aVOur proposed metric measures complexity of sentiment annotation, as perceived by human annotators
p7
aVOur metric adds value to sentiment annotation and sentiment analysis, in these two ways
p8
aVIt may be thought that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) provides implicit annotation the higher the agreement, the easier the piece of text is for sentiment annotation
p9
aVThe complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes
p10
aVTo understand how the formula records sentiment annotation complexity, consider the SACs of examples in section 2
p11
aVThis indicates that although IAA is easy to compute, it does not determine sentiment annotation complexity of text in itself
