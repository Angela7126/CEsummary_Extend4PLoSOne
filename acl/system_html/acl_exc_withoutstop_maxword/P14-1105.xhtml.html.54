<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Because our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as u'\u201c' neutral u'\u201d' or u'\u201c' biased u'\u201d' , we filter the dataset further using dualist [ 23 ] , an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences in our dataset</a>
