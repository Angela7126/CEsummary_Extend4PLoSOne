<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We formulate NLG as a planning problem on a Markov decision process (MDP) [ 15 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This also allows partial completion of communicative goals if not all goals can be achieved simultaneously in the time given</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly deal with very specific communicative goals</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus we use as a reward a measure of the match between the semantic annotation of the partial tree and the communicative goal</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Using the UCT approach with a suitably defined MDP (explained above) allows us to naturally handle probabilistic grammars as well as formulate NLG as a planning problem, unifying the distinct lines of attack described in Section 2</a>
