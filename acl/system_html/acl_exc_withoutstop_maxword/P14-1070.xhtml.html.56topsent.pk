VSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs
p1
aVMWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE
p2
aVRegular MWEs appear with u'\u005cu2019' structured u'\u005cu2019' syntax we modify the tree structure to recover the regular syntactic dependencies
p3
aV\u005cdraftreplace Counts of MWEs automatically structures because classified as regular are shown in Table 1 Table 1 shows the proportions of MWEs classified as regular, and thus further structured
p4
aVTo define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of
