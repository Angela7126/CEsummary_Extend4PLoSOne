<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the skeleton of the input tree/sentence or other not-so-important sub-structures</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, using different skeleton identification results for training and inference (row 3) does not show big improvements due to the data inconsistency problem</a>
