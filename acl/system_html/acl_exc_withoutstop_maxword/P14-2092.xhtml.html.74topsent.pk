VCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p1
aVFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p2
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p3
aVHowever, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the
