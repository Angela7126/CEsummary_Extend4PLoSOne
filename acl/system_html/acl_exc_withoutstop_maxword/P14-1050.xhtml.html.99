<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>From linguistic perspectives, new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As can be seen from Table 4 , the association model (LRT) remarkably boosts the performance of new word detection, indicating LRT is a key factor for new sentiment word extraction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This has linguistic interpretations because new sentiment words are commonly modified by adverbial words and thus should have close association with lexical patterns</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To measure multi-word association, the first model is Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) [ 6 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As our algorithm outputs a ranked list of words, we adapt average precision to evaluate the performance of new sentiment word detection</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The second genre of the studies is to treat new word detection as a classification problem</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Zhou [ 25 ] proposed a discriminative Markov Model to detect new words by chunking one or more separated words</a>
