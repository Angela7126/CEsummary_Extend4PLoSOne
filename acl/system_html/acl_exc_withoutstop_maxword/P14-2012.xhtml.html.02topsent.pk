VThe only study explicitly targeting this problem so far is by Plank and Moschitti [ Plank and Moschitti2013 ] who find that the out-of-domain performance of kernel-based relation extractors can be improved by embedding semantic similarity information generated from word clustering and latent semantic analysis (LSA) into syntactic tree kernels

aVExploiting the shared interest in generalization performance with traditional machine learning, in domain adaptation for RE, we would prefer the relation extractor that fits the source
