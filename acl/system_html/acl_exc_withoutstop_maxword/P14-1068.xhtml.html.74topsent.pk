VUnlike most previous work, our model is defined at a finer level of granularity u'\u005cu2014' it computes meaning representations for individual words and is unique in its use of attributes as a means of representing the textual and visual modalities
p1
aVAs our input consists of natural language attributes, the model would infer textual attributes given visual attributes and vice versa
p2
aVUnlike previous efforts such as the widely used WordSim353 collection () , our dataset contains ratings for visual and textual similarity, thus allowing to study the two modalities (and their contribution to meaning representation) together and in isolation

aVSeveral other models have been extensions of Latent Dirichlet Allocation () where topic distributions are learned from words and other perceptual units use visual words which they extract from a corpus of multimodal documents (i.e.,, BBC news articles and their associated images), whereas others () use feature norms obtained in longitudinal elicitation studies (see for an example) as an approximation of the visual environment
