<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So as to model the translation confidence for a translation phrase pair, we initialize the phrase pair embedding by leveraging the sparse features and recurrent neural network</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this section, we split the phrase pair embedding into two parts to model the translation confidence directly translation confidence with sparse features and translation confidence with recurrent neural network</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We first get two translation confidence vectors separately using sparse features and recurrent neural network, and then concatenate them to be the phrase pair embedding</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Word embedding is used as the input to learn translation confidence score, which is combined with commonly used features in the conventional log-linear model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>2013 ) propose a joint language and translation model, based on a recurrent neural network</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We use recurrent neural network to generate two smoothed translation confidence scores based on source and target word embeddings</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The commonly used features, such as translation score, language model score and distortion score, are used as the recurrent input vector x</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>2013 ) extend the recurrent neural network language model, in order to use both the source and target side information to scoring translation candidates</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We also explore phrase pair embedding method to model</a>
