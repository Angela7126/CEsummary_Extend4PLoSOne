<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So to sum up on the u'\u201c' labeled evaluation u'\u201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>MWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to our linguistic knowledge</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation on u'\u201c' structured representation u'\u201d' can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only both</a>
