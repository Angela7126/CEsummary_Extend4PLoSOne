p3
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method

aVFor the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u005cu27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u005cu27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1

aVWe applied our event causality extraction method to 2,451,254 candidates (Section 3.1 ) and culled the top 1,200,000 phrase pairs from them (See Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-event-causality in the supplementary notes for examples

p11
aVWe collectively call both excitatory and inhibitory templates excitation templates
p12
aVTo increase the number of acceptable scenarios, our method identifies compatibility w.r.t causality between two phrases by a recently proposed semantic polarity, excitation [ 12 ] , which properly relaxes the chaining condition (Section 3.1 describes it
p13
aVProposed , our scenario generation method without the two filters, Proposed+Orig , our method with the original sentence filter, Proposed+Orig+Comm , our method with the original sentence and common argument filters, and Exact , a method that chains event causality by exact matching
p14
aVSection 3.3 shows how to rank event causality candidates
p15
aVSection 3.1 describes how to extract event causality candidates, and Section 3.2 details our features
p16
aVHowever, as described in Section 1 , our event causality criteria are different; since they regarded phrase pairs that were not self-contained as event causality (their annotators checked the original sentences of phrase pairs to see if they were event causality), their judgments tended to be more lenient than ours, which explains the performance difference
p17
aVAnnotators regarded as event causality only phrase pairs that were interpretable as event causality without contexts (i.e.,, self-contained
p18
aVWe applied the excitation filter to all 272,025,401 event causality candidates from the web and 132,528,706 remained
p19
aVExcitation is a semantic property of templates that classifies them into excitatory , inhibitory , and neutral
p20
aVWe then estimated that, with the precision rate, we can extract 69,700 event causality pairs from the 2,451,254 event causality candidates, among which the estimated number of positive examples is 377,794
p21
aVMoreover, for broader coverage, we acquired binary patterns that entail or are entailed by one of the patterns of the above six semantic relations
p22
aVFor context feature extraction, the event causality candidates are accompanied by the original sentences from which they were extracted
p23
aVWe simply add an additional argument position to each template in the 43,697 excitation templates to make binary patterns
p24
aVAfter applying additional filters (see Section LABEL:A-sec:filtering-conditions in the supplementary notes) including those based on a stop-word list and a causal connective list to remove unlikely event causality candidates that are not removed by the above filter, we finally acquired 2,451,254 event causality candidates
p25
aVAn original sentence filter removes a scenario if two event causality pairs that are chained in it are extracted from original sentences between which no word overlap exists other than words constituting causality pairs
p26
aVDefinition-based features , as detailed in Section LABEL:A-sec:definition-based-association-features in the supplementary notes, resemble the Wikipedia-based features except that the information source is the definition sentences automatically acquired from our 600 million web pages using the method of Hashimoto et al
p27
aVWe acquired 335,837 patterns by this method
p28
aVTo favor the baselines for fairness, the event causality candidates of the development and test data were restricted to those with excitation values
p29
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates in Section 3.1
p30
aVOur future scenario generation method creates scenarios by chaining event causalities
p31
aVNoun pairs with this relation can constitute event causality when combined with template pairs like improve A u'\u005cu2192' cultivate B
p32
aVOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p33
aVNext we compared our method with the baselines based on Hashimoto et al
p34
aV5 5 Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method constructs a network of templates based on their co-occurrence in web sentences with a small number of polarity-assigned seed templates and infers the polarity of all the templates in the network by a constraint solver based on the spin model [ 24 ]
p35
aVDo et al used it (along with discourse relations) to extract event causality
p36
aVBelow we describe the semantic relations that we believe are likely to constitute event causality
p37
aVTable 3 shows the results of removing the semantic relation, the context, and the association features from our method
p38
aVSee Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-binary-patterns in the supplementary notes for examples of our binary patterns
p39
aVThis is important since future scenarios, which are generated by chaining event causality as described below, must be self-contained, unlike Hashimoto et al
p40
aVThey are calculated from the 132,528,706 event causality candidates
p41
aVWe hypothesize that two nouns with some particular semantic relations are more likely to constitute event causality
p42
aVWe developed features that capture the characteristics of likely contexts for Japanese event causality (See Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features in the supplementary notes
p43
aVWe require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted
p44
aVWe compared our method and two baselines based on Do et al
p45
aVWe manually collected 187 binary patterns for this relation
p46
aVWe manually collected 748 binary patterns for this relation

aVA common argument filter removes a scenario if a joint part consists of two templates that share no argument in our u'\u005cu27e8' argument, template u'\u005cu27e9' database, which is compiled from the syntactic dependency data between arguments and templates extracted from our web corpus

p53
aVProposed is our method
p54
aVThe experiments in Section 5.1.1 show that not only Causation and Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) but the other relations are also effective for event causality extraction
p55
aVFrom the training data, our method seemed to successfully learn what self-contained event causality is
p56
aVThe baselines are not complete implementations of Do et al u'\u005cu2019' s method which uses discourse relations identified based on Lin et al
p57
aVIn this case, the two event causality pairs tend to be about different topics and constitute an incoherent scenario
p58
aVThe Excitation relation roughly means that A activates B (excitatory) or suppresses it (inhibitory
p59
aVSuch noun pairs mean event causality by substituting them into template pairs like omit A u'\u005cu2192' get B
p60
aVThey developed an automatic excitation template acquisition method that assigns each template an excitation value in range [ - 1 , 1 ] that is positive if the template is excitatory and negative if it is inhibitory
p61
aVProposed is our proposed method
p62
aVOur method achieved 70% precision at 13% recall; we can extract about 69,700 event causality pairs with 70% precision, as described below

aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
p65
aVthe performance degraded (46.27 u'\u005cu2192' 45.86) when we only used the Causation binary patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns compared to Proposed
p66
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1

aVWe extracted 557 social problem nouns and used the cause phrases of the event causality candidates that consisted of one of the social problem nouns as the scenario u'\u005cu2019' s beginning event

aVNote that means can be seen as u'\u005cu201c' causing u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' realizing u'\u005cu201d' the purpose of using the means in this relation, and actually event causality can be obtained by incorporating noun pairs of this relation into template pairs like activate A u'\u005cu2192' conduct B
p73
aVWe collected 257 patterns for this relation
p74
aVWe implement what we consider likely contexts for event causality as context features
p75
aVCausation is the causal relation between two entities and is expressed by binary patterns like A causes B
p76
aVOur underlying intuition is the observation that event causality tends to hold between two entities linked by semantic relations which roughly entail that one entity strongly affects the other
p77
aVFirst, we assume that two nouns (e.g., slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification ) that take some specific binary semantic relations (e.g., A causes B ) tend to constitute event causality if combined with two predicates (e.g., conduct and exacerbate
p78
aVThen we check a noun pair (the nouns of the cause and effect phrases) for each event causality candidate, and give the candidate all the patterns in the database that co-occur with the noun pair
p79
aV2,178 patterns were collected for this relation
p80
aVSee De Saeger et al
p81
aVWe also require the predicate of the cause phrase to syntactically depend on the effect phrase in the sentence from which the event causality was extracted; we guarantee this by verifying the dependencies of the original sentence
p82
aVThese datasets were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who annotated the event causality candidates without looking at the original sentences
p83
aVBesides features similar to those described above, we propose semantic relation features 3 3 Radinsky et al
p84
aVSuch semantic relations can be expressed by (otherwise unintuitive) patterns like A is an ingredient for B
p85
aVWe extract the event causality between two events represented by two phrases from single sentences that are dependency parsed
p86
aVRemember that excitatory templates like cause X entail that X u'\u005cu2019' s function or effect is activated, but inhibitory templates like lower X entail that it is suppressed (Section 3.1
p87
aVCEA-based features are based on the Cause Effect Association (CEA) measure of Do et al
p88
aVAccordingly, we generated a scenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus that was crawled in 2007, but the vibrio risk due to global warming has actually been observed in the Baltic sea and reported in Baker-Austin et al
p89
aVEach phrase in the event causality must consist of a predicate with an argument position ( template , hereafter) like conduct X and a noun like slash-and-burn agriculture that completes X
p90
aVTable 9 shows the estimated number of acceptable scenarios generated with 70% precision
p91
aVSee Section LABEL:A-sec:examples-of-future-scenarios in the supplementary notes for examples of the generated scenarios
p92
aVThey are class-dependent patterns , which have semantic class restrictions on arguments
p93
aVSome of the scenarios we generated are written on no page in our input web corpus

aVTo make event causality self-contained, we wrote guidelines for manually annotating training/development/test data

aV2009 ) , De Saeger et al
p96
aVMany phrase pairs described two events that often happen in parallel but are not event causality (e.g., reduce the intake of energy and increase the energy consumption ) in the highly ranked event causality candidates of Cs u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s and Cs s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p
p97
aVWe observed that CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p and CEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s performed poorly and tended to favor event causality candidates whose phrase pairs were highly relevant to each other but described the contrasts of events rather than event causality (e.g., build a slow muscle and build a fast muscle ) probably because their main components are PMI values
p98
aVEach event causality candidate may be given multiple original sentences, since a phrase pair can appear in multiple sentences, in which case it is given more than one SVM score
p99
aVNote that, for the diversity of the sampled scenarios, our sampling proceeded as follows i) Randomly sample a beginning event phrase from the generated scenarios ii) Randomly sample an effect phrase for the beginning event phrase from the scenarios iii) Regarding the effect phrase as a cause phrase, randomly sample an effect phrase for it, and repeat (iii) up to the specified number of steps (2 or 3
p100
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p101
aVNext we examined whether the semantic relations that do not seem directly relevant to causality like Material are effective
p102
aVThey collectively constitute the \u005cUnderline Entailment relation
p103
aVConsequently we conclude that not only semantic relations directly relevant to causality like Causation but also those that seem to lack direct relevance to causality like Material are somewhat effective
p104
aVTo this end, we propose a supervised method of extracting such event causality as conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification and use its output to generate future scenarios ( scenarios ), which are chains of causality that have been or might be observed in this world like conduct slash-and-burn agriculture u'\u005cu2192' exacerbate desertification u'\u005cu2192' increase Asian dust (from China) u'\u005cu2192' asthma gets worse
p105
aVFor example, a likely context of event causality (underlined) would be
p106
aVOur evaluation is based on average precision ; 9 9 It is obtained by computing the precision for each point in the ranked list where we find a positive sample and averaging all the precision figures [ 18 ] we believe that it is important to rank the plausible event causality candidates higher
p107
aVAs such, semantic relations like the Material relation can also be useful
p108
aVExperiments using 600 million web pages [ 2 ] show that our method outperforms baselines based on state-of-the-art methods [ 8 , 12 ] by more than 19% of average precision
p109
aVFor event causality extraction , clues used by previous methods can roughly be categorized as lexico-syntactic patterns [ 1 , 20 ] , words in context [ 19 ] , associations among words [ 28 , 22 , 8 ] , and predicate semantics [ 12 ]
p110
aVEven when adding the Prevention ( u'\u005cu201c' negative Causation u'\u005cu201d' ) patterns and their entailing and entailed patterns, the performance was still slightly worse than Proposed
p111
aVOur method exploits these features on top of our base features such as nouns and predicates
p112
aVExcitatory templates such as cause X entail that the function, effect, purpose or role of their argument u'\u005cu2019' s referent is activated, enhanced, or manifested, while inhibitory templates such as lower X entail that it is deactivated or suppressed
p113
aVThe number of patterns is 490
p114
aVWe obtained sentences from 600 million web pages
p115
aVNote that semantic relations are not restricted to those directly relevant to causality like A causes B but can be those that might seem irrelevant to causality like A is an ingredient for B (e.g., plutonium and atomic bomb as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p116
aVIndeed materials can participate in event causality with the help of such template pairs as A is stolen u'\u005cu2192' B is made as in plutonium is stolen u'\u005cu2192' atomic bomb is made
p117
aVIts relation to event causality might seem unclear, but a material can be seen as a u'\u005cu201c' cause u'\u005cu201d' of a product
p118
aVAs the beginning event of a scenario, we extracted nouns that describe social problems ( social problem nouns , e.g., deforestation ) from Wikipedia to focus our evaluation on the ability to generate scenarios about them, which is a realistic use-case of scenario generation
p119
aV341 (68.20%) were acceptable, and the estimated number of acceptable scenarios at a precision rate of 70% and 80% are 26,700 and 5,200 (See Section LABEL:A-sec:precision-scenario-curve in the supplementary notes
p120
aVPrevention is the relation expressed by patterns like A prevents B , which can be filled with toothbrushing and periodontal disease
p121
aVThe estimated number is calculated as the product of the recall at 70% precision and the number of acceptable scenarios in all the generated scenarios, which is estimated by the annotated samples
p122
aVNext we examined how many of the top 50,000 scenarios were acceptable and non-trivial , i.e.,, found in no page in our input web corpus, using the 341 acceptable samples
p123
aVFor example, global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) can be chained to constitute an acceptable scenario, but the joint part is not the same string

aVScenarios ( s u'\u005cu2062' c s) generated by chaining causally-compatible phrase pairs are scored by S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s u'\u005cu2062' c ) , which embodies our assumption that an acceptable scenario consists of plausible event causality pairs
p126
aVTwo phrases are causally-compatible if they mention the same entity (typically described by a noun) that is predicated by the templates of the same excitation polarity

aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s web information analysis system provides a what-happens-if QA service, which is based on our scenario generation method
p128
aVNeither involves chaining and restricts themselves to only one event causality step
p129
aVTo show that our future scenario generation methods can generate many acceptable scenarios with reasonable precision, we experimentally compared four methods
p130
aVFor example, our method can identify the compatibility between sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise to chain global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus 2 2 A bacterium in the sea causing food-poisoning fouls (water

aVThey ranked event causality candidates by C u'\u005cu2062' s u'\u005cu2062' ( p 1 , p 2 ) s 1

p133
aVOur second assumption is that there are grammatical contexts in which event causality is more likely to appear
p134
aVOther clues include shared arguments [ 28 , 4 , 5 ] , which we ignore since we target event causality about two distinct entities
p135
aV2011 ) and Kloetzer et al
p136
aVWe evaluated the features of our method by ablation tests
p137
aVOur method optionally applies the following two filters to scenarios for better precision
p138
aVIn a nutshell, they represent a connective ( C1 and C2 in Section LABEL:A-sec:context-features ), the distance between the elements of event causality candidate ( C3 and C4 ), words in context ( C5 to C8 ), the existence of adnominal modifier ( 9 to C10 ), and the existence of additional arguments of cause and effect predicates ( C13 to C20 ), among others
p139
aVTable 8 shows the number and precision of the samples

aVThe samples were annotated by three annotators (not the authors), who were instructed to regard a sample as acceptable if each event causality that constitutes it is plausible and the sample as a whole constitutes a single coherent story

p144
aVWeb-based features provide association measures between nouns using various window sizes in the 600 million web pages

aVA Causation pattern, B by A , constitutes an independent relation called the By relation
p146
aVIt is written in no page in our input web corpus, which was crawled in 2007
p147
aVSome phrase pairs have the same noun pairs and the same template polarity pairs (e.g., omit toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' get a cavity and neglect toothbrushing u'\u005cu2192' have a cavity , where omit X and neglect X are inhibitory and get X and have X are excitatory
p148
aVThe last assumption embodied in our association features is that each word of the cause phrase must have a strong association (i.e.,, PMI, for example) with that of the effect phrase as slash-and-burn agriculture and desertification in the above example, as in Do et al
