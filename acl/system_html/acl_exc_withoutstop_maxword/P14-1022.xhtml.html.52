<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By annotating grammar nonterminals with their headwords, the idea is to better model phenomena that depend heavily on the semantics of the words involved, such as coordination and PP attachment</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Figure 3 shows an example of one instance of this feature template impact is a noun that is more likely to take a PP than other nouns, and so we expect this feature to have high weight and encourage the attachment; this feature proves generally useful in resolving such cases of right-attachments to noun phrases, since the last word of the noun phrase is often the head</a>
