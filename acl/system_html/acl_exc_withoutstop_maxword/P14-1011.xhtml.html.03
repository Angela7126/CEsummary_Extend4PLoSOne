<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To have a better intuition about the power of the BRAE model at learning semantic phrase embeddings, we show some examples in Table 3</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, we can imagine that learning semantic phrase embedding is reasonable if we are given gold vector representations of the phrases</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, no gold semantic phrase embedding exists</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, our model can be easily adapted to learn semantic phrase embeddings using paraphrases</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>With the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Given a phrase pair ( s , t ) , the BRAE model first obtains their semantic phrase representations ( p s , p t ) , and then transforms p s into target semantic space p s * , p t into source semantic space p t *</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>With the semantic phrase embeddings and the vector space transformation function, we apply the BRAE to measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates in the phrase-based SMT</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Obviously, this kind methods of semi-supervised phrase embedding do not fully address the semantic meaning of the phrases</a>
