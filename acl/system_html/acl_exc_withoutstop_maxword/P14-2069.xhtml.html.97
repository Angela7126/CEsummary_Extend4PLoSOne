<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We descrige with the model description, a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the model parameters, and finally how to generate a emotion lexicon based on the model output</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Usually, a high quality emotion lexicon play a significant role when apply the unsupervised approaches for fine-grained emotion classification</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Lastly, previous emotion lexicons are mostly annotated based on many manually constructed resources (e.g.,, emotion lexicon, parsers, etc</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our approach is a weakly supervised approach since only some seeds emotion sentiment words are needed to lanch the process of lexicon construction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since there is no metric explicitly measuring the quality of an emotion lexicon, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in two ways</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For each emotion category, we evaluates it as a binary classification problem</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the evaluation of emotion lexicons, the binary classification is performed in a very simple way</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Hence, the topics consequently group semantically related words into a same emotion category</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus far, most lexicon construction approaches focus on constructing general-purpose</a>
