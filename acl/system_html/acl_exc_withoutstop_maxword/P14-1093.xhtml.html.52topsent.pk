VAccordingly, we generated a scenario deforestation continues u'\u005cu2192' global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) , which is written in no document in our input web corpus that was crawled in 2007, but the vibrio risk due to global warming has actually been observed in the Baltic sea and reported in Baker-Austin et al

aVA common argument filter removes a scenario if a joint part consists of two templates that share no argument in our u'\u005cu27e8' argument, template u'\u005cu27e9' database, which is compiled from the syntactic dependency data between arguments and templates extracted from our web corpus

aVFor example, global warming worsens u'\u005cu2192' sea temperatures are high and sea temperatures rise u'\u005cu2192' vibrio parahaemolyticus fouls (water) can be chained
