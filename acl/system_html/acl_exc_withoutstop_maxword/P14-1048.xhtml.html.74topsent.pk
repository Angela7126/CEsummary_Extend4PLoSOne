VWhile research in discourse parsing can be partitioned into several directions according to different theories and frameworks, Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [ 12 ] is probably the most ambitious one, because it aims to identify not only the discourse relations in a small local context, but also the hierarchical tree structure for the full text from the relations relating the smallest discourse units (called elementary discourse units, EDUs), to the ones connecting paragraphs

aVRather, each relation node R j attempts to model the relation of one single constituent U j , by taking U j u'\u005cu2019' s left and right subtrees U j , L and U j , R as its first-layer nodes; if U j is a single EDU, then the first-layer node of R j is simply U j , and R j is a special relation symbol LEAF 3 3 These leaf constituents are represented using a special feature vector is_leaf = True ; thus the CRF never labels them with relations other than LEAF
