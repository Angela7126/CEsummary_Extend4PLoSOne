<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Note, question decomposition only operates on the original question and question spans covered by complete dependency subtrees</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Two question translation methods are presented in the rest of this subsection, which are based on question patterns and relation expressions respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The above operations are equivalent to answering a simplified question, which is obtained by replacing the answerable spans in the original question with their corresponding answers</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since each relation expression must contain at least one content word, this question cannot match any relation expression</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But as our relation expressions are extracted by an in-house extractor, we can record their extraction-related statistics as extra information, and use them as features to measure the mapping quality</a>
