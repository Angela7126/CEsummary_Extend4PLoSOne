aVIt is a subset of the combined feature, generated by four constraint conditions singleton , position sensitive , bin sensitive and semantic pair
p15
aVIn order to give a better comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, based on our experiment settings and data, we implement the two feature based methods proposed by Che et al
