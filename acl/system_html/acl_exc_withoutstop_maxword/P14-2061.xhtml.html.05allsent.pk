VSign language recognition is the recognition of the meaning of the signs in a given known sign language, whereas sign language identification is the recognition of the sign language itself from given signs
p1
aVWhile some work exists on sign language recognition 1 1 There is a difference between sign language recognition and identification
p2
aV[ 20 , 21 , 9 , 6 ] , very little research exists on sign language identification except for the work by [ 10 ] , where it is shown that sign language identification can be done using linguistically motivated features
p3
aVWhile sign languages show a lot of iconicity in the lexicon [ 22 ] , this has not led to a universal sign language
p4
aVOur contributions a ) show that unsupervised feature learning techniques, currently popular in many pattern recognition problems, also work for visual sign languages
p5
aVAccuracies of 78% and 95% are reported on signer independent and signer dependent identification of two sign languages
p6
aVGiven samples of sign language videos (unknown sign language with one signer per video), our system performs the following steps to learn a feature representation (note that these video samples are separate from the video samples that are later used for classifier learning or testing
p7
aVFirst, to remove any non-signing signals that remain constant within videos of a single sign language but that are different across sign languages
p8
aVThis accuracy is so high that current research has shifted to related more challenging problems language variety identification [ 26 ] , native language identification [ 24 ] and identification at the extremes of scales; many more languages, smaller training data, shorter document lengths [ 1 ]
p9
aVIconicity is also used in the morphosyntax and discourse structure of all sign languages, however, and there we see many similarities between sign languages
p10
aVWhile language identification in signed languages is yet to be studied, significant progress has been recorded for written and spoken languages
p11
aVFor example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background
p12
aVBoth signed and spoken languages manifest iconicity, that is forms of words or signs are somehow motivated by the meaning of the word or sign
p13
aVFirst, to present a method to identify sign languages using features learned by unsupervised techniques [ 12 , 4 ]
p14
aVMore specifically, we show how K-means and sparse autoencoder can be used to learn features for sign language identification b ) demonstrate the impact on performance of varying the number of features (aka, feature maps or filter sizes), the patch dimensions (from 2D to 3D) and the number of frames (video length
p15
aVThe challenges in sign language identification arise from three sources as described below
p16
aVFigure 3 shows visualization of the strength of filter activation for each sign language
p17
aVOur experimental data consist of videos of 30 signers equally divided between six sign languages
p18
aVPart of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers
p19
aVBritish sign language (BSL), Danish (DSL), French Belgian (FBSL), Flemish (FSL), Greek (GSL), and Dutch (NGT
p20
aVThe task of automatic language identification is to quickly identify the identity of the language given utterances
p21
aVPrior research on language identification is heavily biased towards written and spoken languages [ 8 , 27 , 14 , 18 ]
p22
aVThis accuracy obtained for six languages is much higher than the 78% accuracy obtained for two sign languages [ 10 ]
p23
aVThe methods used in spoken language identification have also been extended to a related class of problems native accent identification [ 2 , 3 , 25 ] and foreign accent identification [ 23 ]
p24
aVSecond, to evaluate the method on six sign languages under different conditions
p25
aVAlso, the use of constructed action appears to be used in many sign languages in similar ways
p26
aVFor the supervised learning, 200 videos (consisting of 1 through 4 frames taken at a step of 2) are randomly sampled per sign language per signer (for a total of 6,000 samples
p27
aVThe figure shows what Lasso looks for when it identifies any of the six sign languages
p28
aVAt the level of phonology, there are few differences between sign languages, but the differences in the phonetic realization of words (their articulation) may be much larger
p29
aVThe same concept can be iconically realised by the manual articulators in a way that conforms to the phonological regularities of the languages, but still lead to different sign forms
p30
aVAt present we do not know whether the differences between signers using the same language are of a similar or different nature than the differences between different languages
p31
aVSecond, it looks for activations of the learned representation (by convolution) and uses these activations to learn a classifier to discriminate between sign languages
p32
aVThe variability between signers either in terms of physical properties (hand sizes, colors, etc) or in terms of articulation (movements) is such that it does not affect the understanding of the sign language by humans, but that it may be difficult for machines to generalize over multiple individuals
p33
aVThe same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions in the lexicon these too make sign languages across the world very similar in appearance, even though the meaning of specific articulations may differ [ 7 ]
p34
aVOur system uses learned features that are extracted over much smaller video lengths (about half a second
p35
aVGiven the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows
p36
aVThe data for the unsupervised feature learning comes from half of the BSL and GSL videos in the Dicta-Sign corpus 2 2 http://www.dictasign.eu/
p37
aVFigure 2 shows features learned by K-means and sparse autoencoder
p38
aVThe latter uses linguistically motivated features that are extracted over video lengths of at least 10 seconds
p39
aVSigners u'\u005cu2019' uniqueness results from how they articulate the shapes and movements that are specified by the linguistic structure of the language
p40
aVFor the unsupervised feature learning, two types of patches are created
p41
aVExtract small videos (hereafter called patches) randomly from anywhere in the video samples
p42
aVWritten languages can be identified to about 99% accuracy using Markov models [ 8 ]
p43
aVSpoken languages can be identified to accuracies that range from 79-98% using different models [ 27 , 19 ]
p44
aVWhich filters are active for which language
p45
aVTo avoid this problem, we removed the background by using background subtraction techniques and manually selected thresholds
p46
aVLearning
p47
aVWe train and test our system in leave-one-signer-out cross-validation, where videos from four signers are used for training and videos of the remaining signer are used for testing
p48
aVExtract patches
p49
aVBoth real-world and imaginary objects and locations are visualised in the space in front of the signer, and can have an impact on the articulation of signs in various ways
p50
aVThese challenges are by no means specific to sign interaction, and are found in many other computer vision tasks
p51
aVFirst, it learns a feature representation from patches of unlabelled raw video data [ 12 , 4 ]
p52
aVWe evaluate our system in terms of average accuracies
p53
aVExtract features from equally spaced sub-patches covering the video sample
p54
aVThe background objects of the video may also include dynamic objects u'\u005cu2013' increasing the ambiguity of signing activity
p55
aVPool features together over four non-overlapping regions of the input video to reduce the number of features
p56
aVThis environment can include the visual background and camera noises
p57
aVOur best average accuracy (84.03%) is obtained using 500 K-means features which are extracted over four frames (taken at a step of 2
p58
aVWe call both the centroids and filters as the learned features
p59
aVThe relationship between forms and meanings are not totally arbitrary [ 17 ]
p60
aVThere is evidence that normalization and whitening [ 13 ] improve performance in unsupervised feature learning [ 4 ]
p61
aVEach type consists of randomly selected 100,000 patches and involves 16 different signers
p62
aVThe extraction of classifier features through convolution and pooling is illustrated in figure 1
p63
aVPerforming this task is key in applications involving multiple languages such as machine translation and information retrieval (e.g., metadata creation for large audiovisual archives
p64
aVWe use two unsupervised learning algorithms a) K-means b) sparse autoencoders
p65
aVNote that features from 2D filters are pooled over each frame and concatenated whereas, features from 3D filters are pooled over all frames
p66
aVNormalize the patches
p67
aVWe fix the size of the patches such that they all have r rows, c columns and f frames and we extract patches m times
p68
aVClassification confusions are shown in table 3
p69
aVAll classification accuracies are presented in table 1 for 2D and table 2 for 3D
p70
aVLearn a linear classifier to predict the labels given the feature vectors
p71
aVThe properties and configurations of the camera induce variations of scale, translation, rotation, view, occlusion, etc
p72
aVThe visual u'\u005cu2019' activity u'\u005cu2019' of signing comes in a context of a specific environment
p73
aVGiven the learned centroids c ( k ) , we measure the distance of each data point (patch) to the centroids
p74
aVThe second reason for data preprocessing is to make the input size smaller and uniform
p75
aVFor visual data, normalization corresponds to local brightness and contrast normalization
p76
aVOur method performs two important tasks
p77
aVOur unsupervised algorithm takes in the normalized and whitened dataset u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc7f' = { x ( 1 ) , x ( 1 ) , u'\u005cu2026' , x ( m ) } and maps each input vector x ( i ) to a new feature vector of K features ( f
p78
aVJust as speakers have different voices unique to each individual, signers have also different signing styles that are likely unique to each individual
p79
aVSparse autoencoder we train a single layer autoencoder with K hidden nodes using backpropagation to minimize squared reconstruction error
p80
aVTables 1 and 2 indicate that K-means performs better with 2D filters and that sparse autoencoder performs better with 3D filters
p81
aVWe perform max pooling for K-means and mean pooling for the sparse autoencoder over 2D regions (per frame) and over 3D regions (per all sequence of frames
p82
aVWe converted the videos to grayscale and resized their heights to 144 and cropped out the central 144 * 144 patches
p83
aVAt the hidden layer, the features are mapped using a rectified linear (ReL) function [ 15 ] as follows
p84
aVThese variations coupled with lighting conditions may introduce noise
p85
aVClassification algorithms are used with their default settings and the classification strategy is one-vs.-rest
p86
aVThe data preprocessing stage has two goals
p87
aVNote that ReL nodes have advantages over sigmoid or tanh functions; they create sparse representations and are suitable for naturally sparse data [ 11 ]
p88
aVK-means clustering we train K-means to learns K c ( k ) centroids that minimize the distance between data points and their nearest centroids [ 5 ]
p89
aVFor our experiments, we extract 100,000 patches of size 15 * 15 * 1 (2D) and 15 * 15 * 2 (3D
p90
aVThe videos are colored and their resolutions vary from 320 * 180 to 720 * 576
p91
aVPooling
p92
aVNaturally, the data points are at different distances to each centroid, we keep the distances that are below the average of the distances and we set the other to zero
p93
aVWe use logistic regression classifier and support vector machines [ 16 ]
p94
aVLearn a feature-mapping
p95
aVFrom K-means, we get K R N centroids and from the sparse autoencoder, we get W u'\u005cu2208' R K u'\u005cu2062' x u'\u005cu2062' N and b u'\u005cu2208' R K filters
p96
aVThis paper has two goals
p97
aVWe therefore normalize every patch x ( i ) by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of its elements
p98
aVConvolutional extraction
p99
aVThis gives us u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc7f' = { x ( 1 ) , x ( 1 ) , u'\u005cu2026' , x ( m ) } , where x ( i ) u'\u005cu2208' R N and N = r * c * f (the size of a patch
