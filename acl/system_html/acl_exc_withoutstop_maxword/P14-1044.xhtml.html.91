<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Instead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic structure of those networks</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources [ 27 , 12 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Having lexical resources represented as semantic networks is highly beneficial</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, not all lexical resources provide explicit semantic relations between concepts and, hence, machine-readable dictionaries like Wiktionary have first to be transformed into semantic graphs before such graph-based approaches can be applied to</a>
