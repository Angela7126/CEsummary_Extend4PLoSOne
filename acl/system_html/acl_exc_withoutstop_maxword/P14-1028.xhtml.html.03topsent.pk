VIn our model, the bigram features are extracted in the window context and then the corresponding bigram embeddings are concatenated with character embeddings in Layer 1 and fed into Layer 2
p1
aVIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation
