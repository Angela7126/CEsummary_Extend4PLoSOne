<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Integration with VerbNet has additional benefits, since VerbNet itself is integrated with a variety of linguistic resources, such as PropBank and Penn TreeBank</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because we recruited large numbers of annotators, most of whom annotated only a few items, typical measures of inter-annotator agreement such as Cohen u'\u2019' s kappa are not easily calculated</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In fact, annotators frequently flagged these items as ungrammatical, which is a valuable result in itself for improving VerbNet</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In principle, these judgments would come from naive annotators, since researchers u'\u2019' intuitions about subtle judgments may be unconsciously clouded by theoretical commitments [ 4 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predicates with the same syntactic properties were systematically related semantically</a>
