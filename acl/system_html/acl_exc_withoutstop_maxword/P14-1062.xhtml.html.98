<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A central class of models are those based on neural networks</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Various neural sentence models have been described</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The binary result is based on a DCNN that has a wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a dynamic k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity; it has a second wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The network is topped by a softmax classification layer</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Like in the convolutional networks for object</a>
