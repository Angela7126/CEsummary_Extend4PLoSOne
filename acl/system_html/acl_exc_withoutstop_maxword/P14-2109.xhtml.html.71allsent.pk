VTable 2 lists the most frequent categories in the three datasets, with their percentage of the overall number of brackets (%gold), their score based just on the head identification (F-h), their score based on head identification and (left and right) span (F-s), and the attachment (att) and span-right (spanR) scores for those that match based on the head
p1
aV1) For each regex match, we score whether it matches based on the span as well
p2
aV2) Since the derivation tree is really a dependency tree with more complex nodes [] , we can also score each regex for attachment
p3
aVWe decompose both the gold and parser output trees into derivation trees with spinal etrees, and score based on the regexes projected by each word
p4
aVThe benefit of the approach described here is that now we can see the contribution to the evalb score of the particular types of constructions, and within those constructions, how well the parser is doing at getting the same head projection, but failing or not on the spans
p5
aVHowever, the F-s score is for separate syntactic constructions (including also head identification), although we can also sum it over all the structures, as done later in Figure 6
p6
aVWe show in Section 2.3 how this derivation tree representation is used to score this attachment error directly, rather than obscuring it as an NP bracket error as evalb would do
p7
aVThe simultaneous F-h and F-s scores let us identify constructions where the parser has the head projection correct, but gets the span wrong
p8
aVFor example, the mediocre performance of the parser on SQ-vp barely affects the score with OntoNotes, but has a larger negative effect with Answers, due to its increased frequency in the latter
p9
aV2) We wouldn u'\u005cu2019' t expect the test-on-training evalb score to be 100%, since it has to back off from the training data, but the results for the different categories vary widely, with e.g.,, the NP-modr F-h score much lower than other frequent regexes
p10
aV1) The high performance on the OntoNotes WSJ material is in large part due to the score on the non-recursive regexes of NP-t, VP-t, S-vp, and the auxiliaries (points 1, 2, 4, 6 in the graphs
p11
aVFor example, while u'\u005cu201c' to u'\u005cu201d' is a match for PP-t, its attachment is not, since in Figure 3 it is a child of the u'\u005cu201c' trip u'\u005cu201d' etree (#a5) and in Figure 3 it is a child of the u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' etree (#b3
p12
aVFor example, u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' is a match for VP-t in Figures 3 and 3 , and is also a match for the span as well, since in both derivation trees it includes the words u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu2026' Florida u'\u005cu201d'
p13
aVThe word u'\u005cu201c' make u'\u005cu201d' has a match for the regexes VP-t, VP-aux, and S-vp, and so on
p14
aVThe two graphs in Figure 6 show the cumulative results based on F-h and F-s, respectively
p15
aVPhrase-structure parsing is usually evaluated using evalb [] , which provides a score based on matching brackets
p16
aVWe ran the gold and parsed versions through our regex decomposition and derivation tree creation
p17
aV4 4 We do not have space here to discuss the data structure in complete detail, but multiple regex names at a node, such a VP-aux and VP-t at tree a3 in Figure 3 , indicate multiple VP nonterminals
p18
aVFirst, inspired by the tradition of Tree Adjoining Grammar-based research [] , we use a decomposition of the full trees into u'\u005cu201c' elementary trees u'\u005cu201d' (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' etrees u'\u005cu201d' ), with a derivation tree that records how the etrees relate to each other, as in
p19
aVIn Figure 3 , NP-t in etree #a5 is considered as having the attachment to #a3
p20
aVThis is the case even if the score is broken down by brackets (NP, VP, etc.), because the brackets can represent different types of structures
p21
aVIn this case, the NP on the left is identified as the head d) VP-crd is also a regex for a recursive structure, in this case for VP coordination, picking out the leftmost conjunct as the head of the structure
p22
aVDecomposing the original phrase-structure tree into the smaller components requires some method of determining the u'\u005cu201c' head u'\u005cu201d' of a nonterminal, from among its children nodes, similar to parsing work such as
p23
aVThe regexes allow us to also provide scores based on spans of different construction types
p24
aVWe trained the parser on sections 2-21 of OntoNotes WSJ, and parsed the three datasets with the gold tags, since at present we wish to analyze the parser performance in isolation from Part-of-Speech tagging errors
p25
aVSince this affects the F-s scores for VP-t, VP-aux, and S-vp, the negative effect is large
p26
aVThe F-s score roughly corresponds to the evalb score
p27
aVThere is a match for a regex if the corresponding words in gold/parser files project to that regex, a precision error if the parser file does but the gold does not, and a recall error if the gold does but the parser file does not
p28
aVIn particular, we use the u'\u005cu201c' spinal u'\u005cu201d' structure approach of [] , where etrees are constrained to be unary-branching
p29
aVAs this is work-in-progress, the analysis is not yet complete
p30
aVSumming such scores over the corresponding gold/parser trees gives us F-scores for each regex
p31
aVTo facilitate comparison of our analysis with evalb, we used corpora versions with the same bracket deletion (empty yields and most punctuation) as evalb
p32
aVWe trained the parser on sections 2-21, and so (a) is u'\u005cu201c' test-on-train u'\u005cu201d'
p33
aVTherefore our analysis results in an attachment score for every regex
p34
aVEach structure within a circle is one etree, and the derivation as a whole indicates how these etrees are combined
p35
aVIn contrast to the sort of head rules in [] , these refer as little as possible to specific POS tags
p36
aVAs described above, we are also interested in the type of linguistic construction represented by that one-level structure, each of which instantiates one of a few types - recursive coordination, simple head-and-sister, etc
p37
aVInstead of explicitly listing the POS tags of possible heads, the heads are in most cases determined by their location in the structure
p38
aVWe call the match just for the head the u'\u005cu201c' F-h u'\u005cu201d' score and the match that also includes the span information the u'\u005cu201c' F-s u'\u005cu201d' score
p39
aVWe derived the regexes via an iterative process of inspection of tree decomposition on dataset (a), together with taking advantage of the treebanking experience from some of the co-authors
p40
aVThis work is in the same basic line of research as the inter-annotator agreement analysis work in
p41
aV3 3 Some among the 49 are duplicates, used for different nonterminals, as with (a) and (b) in Figure 1
p42
aVAlso, the attachment score is not relevant for regexes that already express a recursive structure, such as NP-modr
p43
aVThese are best thought of as an extension of head-finding rules, which not only find a head but simultaneously identify each parent/children relation as one of a limited number of types of structures (right-modification, etc
p44
aVThe attachment score does not apply to the recursive categories, as mentioned above
p45
aVWhile this metric serves a valuable purpose in pushing parser research forward, it has limited utility for understanding what sorts of errors a parser is making
p46
aVThe derivation trees provide elements of a dependency analysis, which allow us to calculate scores for head identification and attachment for different projections (e.g.,, PP
p47
aVOne is that there are cases in which bracket spans match, but the head, as found by our regexes, is different in the gold and parser trees
p48
aVFor example, Figure 3 shows the derivation tree resulting from the decomposition of the tree in Figure 5
p49
aV10 10 The final F-s value is lower than the evalb score - e.g., 92.5 for sections 2-21 (the rightmost point in the graph for sections 2-21 in the F-s graph in Figure 6 ) compared to the 93.8 evalb score
p50
aVIt is this matching for span as well as head that allows us to compare our results to evalb
p51
aVThe score is lower for Answers, as also found by
p52
aVThe tree in Figure 5 is the parser output corresponding to the gold tree in Figure 5 , and in this case gets the PP-t attachment wrong, while everything else is the same as the gold
p53
aVThese show the cumulative score in order of the frequency of categories
p54
aV6 6 A regex intermediate in a etree, such as VP-t above, is considered to have a default null attachment
p55
aVTogether these two aspects break down the evalb brackets into more meaningful categories, and the simultaneous head and span scoring allows us to separate these aspects in the analysis
p56
aVIn the results below in Table 2 and Figure 6 we combine the nonterminals that are not covered by one of the regexes with the simple non-recursive regex case for that nonterminal
p57
aV4) While the different distribution of constructions is a problem for Answers, more critical is the poor performance of the parser on determining the right edge of verbal constructions
p58
aVCritical to this is the fact that the parser does well on determining the right edge of verbal structures, which affects the F-s score for VP-t (non-recursive), VP-aux, and S-vp
p59
aVSample regexes are shown in Figure 1
p60
aVThe other cases is when brackets match, and may even have the same head, but their regex is different
p61
aV3) The different distribution of structures in Answers hurts performance
p62
aV9 9 The score for the left edge is almost always very high for every category, and we just list here the right edge score
p63
aVThis is reflected in the derivation tree in Figure 3 , in which the NP-modr regex is absent, with the NP-t and PP-t etrees #b5 and #b6 both pointing to the VP-t regex in #b3
p64
aVOn PP attachment u'\u005cu201d' etc
p65
aVPreliminary investigation shows that this is due in part to incorrect PP and SBAR placement (the PP-t and SBAR-s attachment scores (80.7 and 81.9) are worse for Answers compared to Section 22 (86.1 and 86.4)), and coordinated S-clauses with no conjunction
p66
aVIn some cases, we need to search for particular nonterminal heads, such as with the (b) regexes S-vp and SQ-vp, which identify the rightmost VP among the children of a S or SQ as the head c) NP-modr is a regex for a recursive NP with a right modifier
p67
aVWe first describe the use of the regexes in tree decomposition, and then give some examples of incorporating these regexes into the derivation trees
p68
aVThe spanR score for VP-t is 95.8 for Sections 2-21 and 93.7 for Section 22
p69
aVThis is only 85.4 for VP-t in Answers, compared to the OntoNotes results mentioned in (1
p70
aVStructures with a CONJ/CONJP/NML child do not match this rule and are handled by different regexes, which are all mutually exclusive
p71
aVThe nonterminals of the spinal etrees are the names of the regexes, with the simpler nonterminal labels trivially derivable from the regex names
p72
aVAfter describing in more detail the basic framework, we show some aspects of the resulting analysis of the performance of the Berkeley parser [] on three datasets a) OntoNotes WSJ sections 2-21 [] 1 1 We refer only to the WSJ treebank portion of OntoNotes, which is roughly a subset of the Penn Treebank [] with annotation revisions including the addition of NML nodes
p73
aVFor example, comparing the trees in Figures 5 and 5 via their derivation trees in Figures 3 and Figures 3 , the word u'\u005cu201c' trip u'\u005cu201d' has a match for the regex NP-t, but a recall error for NP-modr
p74
aVTable 1 shows the number and percentage of brackets handled by our regexes
p75
aVFor example, for sections 2-21, the score for NP-t is shown first, with 30.7% of the brackets, and then together with the VP-t category, they cover 45.2% of the brackets, etc
p76
aVThe gold tree is shown without the SBJ function tag
p77
aVTable 1 shows the sizes of the three corpora in terms of tokens and brackets, for both the gold and parsed versions, with the evalb scores for the parsed versions
p78
aV(b) OntoNotes WSJ section 22, and (c) the u'\u005cu201c' Answers u'\u005cu201d' section of the English Web Treebank []
p79
aVHere we indicate with arrows that point to the relevant regex
p80
aV7 7 In future work we will compare our approach to that of , who also move beyond evalb scores in an effort to provide more meaningful error analysis
p81
aVIn future work we will provide a full accounting of such cases, but they do not affect the main aspects of the analysis
p82
aVRegexes ADJP-t and ADVP-t in (a) identify their terminal head to be the rightmost terminal, possibly preceded by some number of terminals or nonterminals, relying on a mapping that maps all terminals (except CC, which is mapped to CONJ) to TAG and all nonterminals (except CONJP and NML) to NT
p83
aVThe regex names roughly describe their purpose - u'\u005cu201c' mod u'\u005cu201d' for right-modification, u'\u005cu201c' crd u'\u005cu201d' for coordination, etc
p84
aVThese three results together show how the parser is generalizing from the training data, and what aspects of the u'\u005cu201c' domain adaptation u'\u005cu201d' problem to the web material are particularly important
p85
aVFor example, the PP-t etree #a6 points to the NP-modr regex, which consists of the NP-t together with the PP-t
p86
aVWe present the results in two ways
p87
aVThe suffix u'\u005cu201c' -t u'\u005cu201d' is for the simple non-recursive case in which the head is a terminal
p88
aVThe current work scores on general categories of structures, without the reliance on sequences of individual strings
p89
aVThe high coverage (%) reinforces the point that there is a limited number of core structures in the treebank
p90
aVThe names of these regexes are incorporated into the etrees themselves, as labels of the nonterminals
p91
aVThe crucial step is that we integrate these regexes into the spinal etrees
p92
aVWe would also like to have answers to such questions as u'\u005cu201c' How does the parser do on non-recursive NPs, separate from NPs resulting from modification
p93
aVVP
p94
aVSecond, we use a set of regular expressions (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' regexes u'\u005cu201d' ) that categorize the possible structures in the treebank
p95
aVPP
p96
aVIn sum, there is a wealth of information from this new type of analysis that we will use in our on-going work to better understand what the parser is learning and how it works on different genres
p97
aVThere are 49 regexes used
p98
aV^(head:VP) (VP)* CONJ VP$
p99
aVWe address both tasks together with the regexes
p100
aVWe highlight a few points here
p101
aVHowever, that work did not utilize regexes, and focused on comparing sequences of identical strings
p102
aVSpace prevents full explanation, but there are two reasons for this
p103
aVThis variance from the test-on-training dataset carries over almost exactly to Section 22
p104
aVThis allows an etree to contain information such as u'\u005cu201c' this node represents right modification u'\u005cu201d'
p105
aV5 5 We leave function tags aside for future work
p106
aV^(TAG
