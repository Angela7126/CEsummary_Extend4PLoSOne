<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As we have discussed above, we will use the human annotated sentiment for the arguments, same as in the models discussed in Section 3</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>That is, the model parameters are only based on the sentiment value of the arguments</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, in our current study, we focus on exploring the behavior of negators</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The more recent work of [] proposed models based on recursive neural networks that do not rely on any heuristic rules</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This corpus provides us with the data to further understand the quantitative behavior of negators, as the effect of negators can now be studied with arguments of rich syntactic and semantic variety</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The original RNTN and the PSTN predict 5-class sentiment for each negated phrase; we map the output to real-valued scores based on the scale that used to map real-valued sentiment scores to sentiment categories</a>
