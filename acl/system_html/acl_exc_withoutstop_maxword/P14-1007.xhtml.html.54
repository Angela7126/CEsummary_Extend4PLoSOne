<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To shed more light on specific strengths and weaknesses of our approach, we performed a manual error analysis of scope predictions by Crawler, starting from gold cues so as to focus in-depth analysis on properties specific to scope resolution over MRSs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We combine our system with the outputs from the best-performing 2012 submission, the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12, firstly by relying on the latter for system negation cue detection, 4 4 \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 predicted cues using a closed vocabulary assumption with a supervised classifier to disambiguate instances of cues and secondly as a fall-back in system combination as described in 3.4 below</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Both approaches attempted to handle discontinuous instances by applying two heuristics to the predicted scope a) removing preceding conjuncts from the scope when the cue is in a conjoined phrase and (b) removing sentential adverbs from the scope</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If an EP shares its label with the negation cue, or is a quantifier whose restriction ( \srl RSTR) is \sqeq equated with the label of the negation cue, it cannot be in-scope unless its \srl ARG0 is an argument of the negation cue, or the \srl ARG0 of the negation cue is one of its own arguments</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Furthermore, the guidelines treat relative clauses as subordinate clauses and thus negation inside a relative clause is treated as bound to</a>
