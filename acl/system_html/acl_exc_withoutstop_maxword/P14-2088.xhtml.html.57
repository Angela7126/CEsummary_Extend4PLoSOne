<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As we will show, substantial efficiency improvements can be obtained by designing domain adaptation methods for learning in structured feature spaces</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising autoencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For each feature template, there are thousands of binary features</a>
