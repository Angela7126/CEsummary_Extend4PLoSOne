VWe define answer node as the node that is the answer and answer relation as the relation from the answer node to its direct parent
p1
aVThus for the Freebase graph, we use relations (with directions) and properties as features for each node
p2
aVWe treat QA on Freebase as a binary classification task for each node in the topic graph, we extract features and judge whether it is the answer node
p3
aVThese properties, along with the sibling relationship to the topic node, are important cues for answering the question
p4
aVGiven a topic, we selectively roll out the Freebase graph by choosing those nodes within a few hops of relationship to the topic node , and form a topic graph
p5
aVUnfortunately Freebase does not contain an exact relation called brother , but instead sibling
p6
aVThus assuming there is an alignment model that is able to tell how likely one relation maps to the original question, we add extra alignment-based features for the incoming and outgoing relation of each node
p7
aVWe combine question features and Freebase features (per node) by doing a pairwise concatenation
p8
aVAs a simple baseline, u'\u005cu201c' word overlap u'\u005cu201d' counts the overlap between relations and the question
p9
aV1) u'\u005cu201c' basic u'\u005cu201d' features include feature productions read off from the feature graph (Figure 1 ); 2) u'\u005cu201c' + word overlap u'\u005cu201d' adds additional features on whether sub-relations have overlap with the question; and 3) u'\u005cu201c' + CluewebMapping u'\u005cu201d' adds the ranking of relation prediction given the question according to CluewebMapping
p10
aVFor example, for the question who cheated on celebrity A , answers can be retrieved via the Freebase relation celebrity.infidelity.participant , but the connection between the phrase cheated on and the formal KB relation is not explicit
p11
aVThen we computed how much and how well the answer relation was triggered by ReverbMapping and CluewebMapping
p12
aVW eb Q uestions not only has answers annotated, but also which Freebase topic nodes the answers come from
p13
aVif a node was tagged with a question feature, then replace this node with its question feature, e.g.,, what u'\u005cu2192' qword=what;
p14
aVThus for the question, who is the father of King George VI , we ask two questions does the mapping, 1 coverage) contain the answer relation people.person.parents
p15
aVGiven that turkers annotated answers based on the topic page via a browser, this supports the assumption that the same answer would be located in the topic graph, which is then passed to the QA engine for feature extraction and classification
p16
aVThus we evaluated the ranking of retrieval with the gold standard annotation on train-all , shown in Table 3
p17
aVThese percentage numbers are good clue for feature design for instance, we may be confident in a relation if it is ranked top 5 or 10 by CluewebMapping
p18
aVFor instance, for common celebrity gossip questions like who cheated on celebrity A , it is hard for a system to find the Freebase relation celebrity.infidelity.participant as the target relation if it had not observed this pattern in training
p19
aVThen features are extracted in the following form with s the source and t the target node, for every edge e u'\u005cu2062' ( s , t ) in the graph, extract s , t , s u'\u005cu2223' t and s u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cu2223' e u'\u005cu2223' u'\u005cu2062' t as features
p20
aVTable 3 ), thus we also tested on the top 10 results returned by the Search API
p21
aVThis simple example points out that every part of the question could change what the question inquires eventually
p22
aVAs a fair comparison, ranking of CluewebMapping under uniform distribution is also included in Table 2 (a
p23
aV2013 ) originally used it they employed a discriminative log-linear model to judge relations and that might yield better performance
p24
aV2013 ) ) if a predicted answer list does not have a perfect match with all gold answers, as a lot of questions in W eb Q uestions contain more than one answer
p25
aVBoth ClueWeb and its Freebase annotation has a bias
p26
aVFurthermore, the reason that we have kept some lexical features, such as brother , is that we hope to learn from training a high correlation between brother and some Freebase relations and properties (such as sibling and male ) if we do not possess an external resource to help us identify such a correlation
p27
aVFor the film.film.directed_by relation, some important stop words that could indicate this relation, such as by and with , rank directly after director and direct
p28
aVWe split each html document by sentences [ 21 ] using NLTK [ 3 ] and extracted those with at least two Freebase entities which has at least one direct established relation according to Freebase
p29
aVFor instance, for the film.actor.film relation (mapping from film names to actor names), the top words given by P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) are won , star , among , show
p30
aVThus we took out the word overlapping and CluewebMapping based features, and the new F 1 on test was 36.9 u'\u005cu2062' %
p31
aVThe extraction formed two parallel corpora, one with u'\u005cu201c' relation - sentence u'\u005cu201d' pairs (for estimating P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) ) and the other with u'\u005cu201c' subrelations - sentence u'\u005cu201d' pairs (for P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r )
p32
aVWe computed standard MAP (Mean Average Precision) and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), shown in Table 2 (a
p33
aVSince the relations on one side of these pairs are not natural sentences, we ran the most simple IBM alignment Model 1 [ 5 ] to estimate the translation probability with GIZA++ [ 30 ]
p34
aVWith the recent growth in KBs such as DBPedia [ 1 ] , Freebase [ 4 ] and Yago2 [ 18 ] , it has become more practical to consider answering questions across wider domains, with commercial systems including Google Now , based on Google u'\u005cu2019' s Knowledge Graph , and Facebook Graph Search , based on social network connections
p35
aVWe evaluated on the training set in two aspects coverage and prediction performance
p36
aVThus we were firstly interested in the coverage of mined relation mappings
p37
aVReverbMapping does the same, except that we took a uniform distribution on P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) since the contributed dataset did not include co-occurrence counts to estimate these probabilities
p38
aVFor example, the person.parents relationship helps answering questions about parenthood
p39
aVBy counting how many times each relation R was annotated, we can estimate P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r

p41
aVResearchers in semantic parsing have recently explored QA over Freebase as a way of moving beyond closed domains such as GeoQuery [ 35 ]
p42
aVThe API returns almost identical information as displayed via a web browser to a user viewing this topic
p43
aVThe L1 regularization encourages sparse features by driving feature weights towards zero, which was ideal for the over-generated feature space
p44
aVWe will view a KB as an interlinked collection of u'\u005cu201c' topics u'\u005cu201d'
p45
aVWhile making semantic parsing more robust is a laudable goal, here we provide a more rigorous IE baseline against which those efforts should be compared we show that u'\u005cu201c' traditional u'\u005cu201d' IE methodology can significantly outperform prior state-of-the-art as reported in the semantic parsing literature, with a relative gain of  34% F 1 as compared to Berant et al
p46
aVWe took this as a u'\u005cu201c' good enough u'\u005cu201d' IR front-end and used it on test
p47
aVFor the edge, prep_of(qfocus=name, brother) , this would mean the following features qfocus=name , brother , qfocus=name u'\u005cu2223' brother , and qfocus=name u'\u005cu2223' prep_of u'\u005cu2223' brother
p48
aVOne challenge for natural language querying against a KB is the relative informality of queries as compared to the grammar of a KB

aVOur work pushes the data challenge to the limit by mining directly from ClueWeb , a 5TB collection of web data

aVspecial case) if a qtopic node was tagged as a named entity, then replace this node with its its named entity form, e.g.,, bieber u'\u005cu2192' qtopic=person;

aVDue to the bias and incompleteness of any data source, we approximate the true probability of P with P ~ under our specific model
p56
aVThe Information Extraction (IE) community approaches QA differently first performing relatively coarse information retrieval as a way to triage the set of possible answer candidates, and only then attempting to perform deeper analysis

aV[Ranking on answer relations
p62
aVWe call this a question feature graph , with every node and relation a potential feature for this question
p63
aVWith regards to the question, we know we are looking for the name of a person based on the following
p64
aVWith an Information Retrieval (IR) front-end, we need to locate the exact Freebase topic node a question is about
p65
aVSome of the mapping can be simply detected as paraphrasing or lexical overlap
p66
aVWe aim to maximally automate the answer extraction process, by massively combining discriminative features for both the question and the topic graph
p67
aVTo keep things simple, we did not perform answer voting, but simply extracted answers from the first (ranked by the Search API) topic node with predicted answer(s) found
p68
aVCluewebMapping successfully ranked 19 u'\u005cu2062' % of answer relations as top 1
p69
aVOnce a topic is obtained we query the Freebase Topic API [ 14 ] to retrieve all relevant information, resulting in a topic graph
p70
aVThus we need to count for each word w in Q
p71
aVThe topic of the question helps us find relevant Freebase pages
p72
aVWhen given a question about one or several topics, we can select a u'\u005cu201c' view u'\u005cu201d' of the KB concerning only involved topics, then inspect every related node within a few hops of relations to the topic node in order to extract the answer
p73
aVTable 5 gives the final F 1 on test u'\u005cu201c' Gold Retrieval u'\u005cu201d' always ranked the correct topic node top 1, a perfect IR front-end assumption
p74
aVPerformance is thus bounded by the accuracy of the original semantic parsing, and the well-formedness of resultant database queries
p75
aVTable 1 shows the coverage of CluewebMapping, which covers 93.0 u'\u005cu2062' % of all answer relations

p92
aVTable 2 (b) further shows the percentage of answer relations with respect to their ranking
p93
aVThese systems were limited to closed-domains due to a lack of knowledge resources, computing power, and ability to robustly understand natural language
p94
aVOur system learned, for instance, when the question asks for geographic adjacency information ( qverb=border ), the correct answer relation to look for is location.adjoins
p95
aVIn contrast, ReverbMapping covers 89.7 u'\u005cu2062' % of the answer relations
p96
aVTable 4 shows that the additional CluewebMapping features improved overall F 1 by 5 u'\u005cu2062' % , a 13 u'\u005cu2062' % relative improvement a remarkable gain given that the model already learned a strong correlation between question types and answer types (explained more in discussion and Table 6 later
p97
aVAlso, we did an ablation test on dev about how additional features on the mapping between Freebase relations and the original questions help, with three feature settings
p98
aVQuestion verbs are also good hints of answer types
p99
aVNote that there can be more than one topic in the question
p100
aVThe combination between questions and Freebase nodes captures some real gist of QA pattern typing, shown in Table 6 with sampled features and weights
p101
aVIn this way we hope to capture the association between question patterns and answer nodes
p102
aVThe learning problem is challenging for about 3000 questions in train , there are 3 million nodes ( 1000 nodes per topic graph), and 7 million feature types
p103
aVOne major difference between relations and properties is that both arguments of a relation are nodes, while only one argument of a property is a node, the other a string
p104
aVFor this purpose we used the Freebase Search API [ 13 ] .All named entities 8 8 When no named entities are detected, we fall back to noun phrases in a question were sent to this API, which returned a ranked list of relevant topics
p105
aVThe idea is very similar they intersected Freebase relations with predicates in (arg1, predicate, arg2) triples extracted from ReVerb to learn the mapping between Freebase relations and triple predicates
p106
aVAll questions were annotated with answers from Freebase
p107
aVAll questions contain at least one answer from Freebase
p108
aVNext we evaluated the prediction performance, using the evaluation metrics of information retrieval
p109
aVThe objective is to find the most likely relation a question prompts
p110
aVBesides incoming and/or outgoing relationships, nodes also have properties a string that describes the attribute of a node, for instance, node type, gender or height (for a person
p111
aVMore recent research started to minimize this direct supervision by using latent meaning representations [ 2 , 24 ] or distant supervision [ 23 ]
p112
aVWe propose instead to learn discriminative features from the data with shallow question analysis
p113
aVHere we instead directly mine relation mappings from ClueWeb and show that both direct relation mapping precision and indirect QA F 1 improve by a large margin

aVCluewebMapping ranks each relation by P ~ ( R u'\u005cu2223' Q

aVOne question of interest is whether our system, aided by the massive web data, can be fairly compared to the semantic parsing approaches (note that Berant et al
p118
aVWe call this dataset ReverbMapping and ours CluewebMapping
p119
aVFinally the ranking (e.g.,, top 1/2/5/10/100 and beyond) of each relation is used as features instead of a pure probability
p120
aVThe evaluation dataset, W eb Q uestions , was also contributed by Berant et al
p121
aVWe also evaluated how well the search API served the IR purpose
p122
aVIn this section we describe a u'\u005cu201c' translation u'\u005cu201d' table between Freebase relations and NL words was built
p123
aVThe top 2 results of the Search API contain gold standard topics for more than 90 u'\u005cu2062' % of the questions and the top 10 results contain more than 95 u'\u005cu2062' %
p124
aVFor instance, for the question who is the father of King George VI , the most likely relation we look for is people.person.parents
p125
aVThey connect the nodes with the question and describe some unique characteristics
p126
aVThe system of comparison is that of Berant et al
p127
aVWe instead attack the problem of QA from a KB from an IE perspective we learn directly the pattern of QA pairs, represented by the dependency parse of questions and the Freebase structure of answer candidates, without the use of intermediate, general purpose meaning representations
p128
aVWith a high performance learner we have found that a system with millions of features can be trained within hours, leading to intuitive, human interpretable features
p129
aVHowever, most Freebase relations are framed in a way that is not commonly addressed in natural language questions
p130
aVMore interestingly, for the question who is the father of the Periodic Table , the actual relation that encodes its original meaning is law.invention.inventor , rather than people.person.parents
p131
aVFor example, we learn that given a question concerning money , such as what money is used in ukraine , the expected answer type is likely currency
p132
aVFor instance, without the properties type:person and gender:male , we would not have known the node Jaxon Bieber represents a male person
p133
aVWe re-used W eb Q uestions , a dataset collected by Berant et al
p134
aVquestion verb ( qverb ), such as is/play/take , extracted from the main verb of the question
p135
aVSpecifically, for each relation r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l in a topic graph, we compute P ( r e l u'\u005cu2223' q u e s t i o n ) to rank the relations
p136
aVFor instance, in a loglinear model setting, we expect to learn a high feature weight for features like
p137
aVTo alleviate this problem, the best attempt so far is to map from ReVerb [ 10 ] predicate-argument triples to Freebase relation triples [ 6 , 2 ]
p138
aVNote that our dev set is different from that of Berant et al
p139
aVThey are lowercased and some contain typos and gave them access to Freebase, that person might first determine that the question is about Justin Bieber (or his brother), go to Justin Bieber u'\u005cu2019' s Freebase page, and search for his brother u'\u005cu2019' s name
p140
aVAmong them, we were able to learn the rule mapping using more than 10 thousand relation-sentence pairs for each of the 89.5 u'\u005cu2062' % of all answer relations
p141
aVGiven these two resources, for each binary Freebase relation, we can find a collection of sentences each of which contains both of its arguments, then simply learn how words in these sentences are associated with this relation, i.e.,, P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) and P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r
p142
aVNote the scale difference although ReVerb was also extracted from ClueWeb09, there were only 15 million triples to intersect with the relations, while we had 1.2 billion alignment pairs
p143
aVAlso, CluewebMapping gives reasonably good precision on its prediction, despite the noisy nature of web data
p144
aVTo conclude, we found that CluewebMapping provides satisfying coverage on the 3778 training questions only 7 u'\u005cu2062' % were missing, despite the biased nature of web data
p145
aVWe next formally evaluate how the learned mapping help predict relations from words

aVDetailed comparison with the output from Berant et al

aVTo put it more formally, given a question Q of a word vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' , we want to find out the relation R that maximizes the probability P ( R u'\u005cu2223' Q )
p150
aVThen we convert the dependency parse into a more generic question graph, in the following steps

p183
aVThis combination greatly enlarges the total number of features, but owing to progress in large-scale machine learning such feature spaces are less of a concern than they once were (concrete numbers in § 6 Model Tuning
p184
aVOne other reason that we estimated P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r ) for sub-relations is that Freebase relations share some common structures in between them

aVFor the simplicity of computation, we assume conditional independence between words and apply Naive Bayes
p205
aVWe move on to fully evaluate the final QA F 1
p206
aVFinally, the ratio of positive vs negative examples affect final F 1 the more positive examples, the lower the precision and the higher the recall
p207
aVTypically questions are converted into some meaning representation (e.g.,, the lambda calculus), then mapped to database queries
p208
aVThis dataset has been split by 65 u'\u005cu2062' % / 35 u'\u005cu2062' % into train-all and test
p209
aVMost work approaches this via the bridge of various intermediate representations, including combinatory categorial grammar (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007, 2009; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010, 2011, 2013), synchronous context-free grammars [ 37 ] , dependency trees [ 27 , 2 ] , string kernels [ 20 , 7 ] , and tree transducers [ 19 ]
p210
aVThe following linguistic information is of interest
p211
aVOur method achieves state-of-the-art performance with F 1 at 42.0 u'\u005cu2062' % , a 34 u'\u005cu2062' % relative increase from the previous F 1 of 31.4 u'\u005cu2062' %
p212
aVWe employed a high-performance machine learning tool, Classias [ 31 ]
p213
aVWe further randomly divided train-all by 80 u'\u005cu2062' % / 20 u'\u005cu2062' % to a smaller train and development set dev
p214
aVFinally, the KB community has developed other means for QA without semantic parsing [ 29 , 12 , 36 , 39 , 34 ]
p215
aV1 1 As an example, 50 u'\u005cu2062' % of errors of the CCG-backed [ 24 ] system were contributed by parsing or structural matching failure
p216
aVIn this case we back off to the u'\u005cu201c' sub-relations u'\u005cu201d' a relation R is a concatenation of a series of sub-relations R = u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2b' = r 1 r 2 r 3 u'\u005cu2026'
p217
aVTraining usually took around 4 hours
p218
aVAgain, we assume conditional independence between sub-relations and apply Naive Bayes
p219
aVWe ran 5 iterations of EM on each one and finally aligned the 1.2 billion pairs from both directions
p220
aVThis boosted the final F 1 on dev to 48 u'\u005cu2062' %
p221
aVFigure 1 (b) shows an example
p222
aVIn answering our example query a person might take into consideration multiple constraints
p223
aVWe discuss it below through feature and error analysis
p224
aVWe show one example in Figure 1 (a), left side
p225
aVWe hope that the shared sub-relation, parents , can help better estimate for the less annotated
p226
aVIn the following we describe how we represent this process
p227
aVHowever, due to significant popular interest in certain news categories, and the resultant catering by websites to those information desires, then for example we also learned a heavily correlated connection between Jennifer Aniston and celebrity.infidelity.victim , and between some other you-know-who names and celebrity.infidelity.participant
p228
aVWe evaluate the final F 1 in this section
p229
aVThe precision and recall of annotation were estimated at 80 - 85 u'\u005cu2062' % and 70 - 85 u'\u005cu2062' % [ 32 ]
p230
aVThe tricky part was to align these 1.2 billion pairs
p231
aVThe ClueWeb09 6 6 http://lemurproject.org/clueweb09/ dataset is a collection of 1 billion webpages (5TB compressed in raw html ) in 10 languages by Carnegie Mellon University in 2009
p232
aVUnder the original setting, this ratio was about 1
p233
aVThe learning task can be framed in the following short steps
p234
aVEach corpus has 1.2 billion pairs
p235
aVFor instance, play is likely to be followed by an instrument, a movie or a sports team
p236
aVThis produced precision around 60 u'\u005cu2062' % and recall around 35 u'\u005cu2062' % (c.f
p237
aVTo speed up, the 1.2 billion pairs were split into 100 even chunks
p238
aVWe use a list of 9 common qwords

aVHeuristics and manual templates were also commonly used [ 8 ]

aV2013 ) is a work in progress and will be presented in a follow-up report
p244
aVFrom the co-occurrence matrix we computed P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' R ) , P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( R ) , P ~ ( w u'\u005cu2223' r ) and P ~ u'\u005cu2062' ( r )
p245
aVDetails in § 5
p246
aVTo optimize for F 1 , we down-sampled the negative examples to 20 u'\u005cu2062' % , i.e.,, a new ratio of 1
p247
aVIn practice the precision/recall balance can be adjusted by the positive/negative ratio
