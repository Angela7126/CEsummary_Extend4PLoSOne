<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To address this limitation, a Naive Bayes model (NBM) is proposed in this study as a novel, probabilistic treatment of overlap in gloss-based WSD</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods</a>
