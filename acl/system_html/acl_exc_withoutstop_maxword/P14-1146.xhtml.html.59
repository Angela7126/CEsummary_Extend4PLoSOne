<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We compare sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE h , SSWE r , SSWE u ) with baseline embedding learning algorithms by only using word embedding as features for Twitter sentiment classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We conduct experiments to evaluate SSWE by incorporating it into a supervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We apply sentiment-specific word embedding for Twitter sentiment classification under a supervised learning framework as in previous work [ 33 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We apply SSWE as features in a supervised learning framework for Twitter sentiment classification, and evaluate it on the benchmark dataset in SemEval 2013</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also directly evaluate the effectiveness of the SSWE by measuring the word similarity in the embedding space for sentiment lexicons</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Following the traditional C W model [ 9 ] , we incorporate the sentiment information into the neural network to learn sentiment-specific word embedding</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When such word embeddings are fed as features to a Twitter sentiment classifier, the discriminative ability of sentiment words are weakened thus the classification performance is affected</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The quality of SSWE is also directly evaluated by measuring the word similarity in the embedding space for sentiment lexicons</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Many studies on Twitter sentiment classification [ 32 , 10 , 1 , 22 , 48 ] leverage massive noisy-labeled tweets selected by positive and negative emoticons as training set and build sentiment classifiers</a>
