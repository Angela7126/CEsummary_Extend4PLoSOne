VWe now evaluate STRUCT u'\u005cu2019' s ability to generate sentences given negated communicative goals
p1
aVWe first evaluate STRUCT u'\u005cu2019' s ability to accomplish multiple communicative goals when generating a single sentence
p2
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u005cu201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found
p3
aVIn this paper, we study the restricted NLG problem given a grammar, lexicon, world and a communicative goal, output a valid English sentence that satisfies this goal
p4
aVMany such NLG-as-planning systems use a pipeline architecture, working from their communicative goal through discourse planning and sentence generation
p5
aVSTRUCT takes three inputs in order to generate a single sentence
p6
aVWe describe the inputs to STRUCT, followed by the underlying MDP formalism and the probabilistic planning algorithm we use to generate sentences in this MDP
p7
aVFollowing prior work [ 11 ] , we consider a series of sentence generation problems which require the planner to generate a sentence like u'\u005cu201c' The Adj 1 Adj 2 u'\u005cu2026' Adj k dog chased the cat u'\u005cu201d' , where the string of adjectives is a string that distinguishes one dog (whose
