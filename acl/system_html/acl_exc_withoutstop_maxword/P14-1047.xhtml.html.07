<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Table 4 shows the average distance from the convergence reward over 20 runs for 100,000 episodes per epoch, for different numbers of fruits, and for all four methods (Q-learning, PHC-LF, PHC-W, and PHC-WoLF</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For comparison, with a variable exploration rate it took about 225,000 episodes per epoch for convergence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also, the convergence reward for Agent 1 is 1200 and the convergence reward for Agent 2 is also 1200</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For 4 fruits, after 225,000 episodes per epoch there is still no convergence</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, when converging to the maximum total utility solution, in the case of 4 fruits (4 apples and 4 oranges), the average reward of the two agents should be 1200 minus 10 for making or accepting an offer</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Given that Agent 1 is more interested in apples and Agent 2 cares more about oranges, the maximum total utility solution would be the case where each agent offers to get all the fruits it cares about and to give its interlocutor all the fruits it does not care about, and the other agent accepts this offer</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In this section we report results with a constant exploration rate for all training epochs (see section 4</a>
