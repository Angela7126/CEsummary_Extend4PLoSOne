VWe then limit the set of translation options for each unlabeled source phrase (§ 2.3 ), and using a structured graph propagation algorithm, where translation information is propagated from labeled to unlabeled phrases proportional to both source and target phrase similarities, we estimate probability distributions over translations for the unlabeled source phrases (§ 2.4

aVThe union of each unlabeled phrase u'\u005cu2019' s labeled neighbors u'\u005cu2019' labels, which represents the set of target phrases that occur as translations of source phrases that are similar to the unlabeled source phrase

aVThe objective of the generation step is to populate the target graph with additional target phrases for all unlabeled source phrases, yielding the full set of possible translations for the phrase
