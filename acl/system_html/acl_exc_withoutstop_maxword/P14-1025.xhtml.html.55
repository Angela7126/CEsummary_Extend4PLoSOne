<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We further propose a method for applying our sense distribution acquisition system to the task of finding unattested senses u'\u2014' i.e.,, senses that are in the sense inventory but not attested in a given corpus</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We evaluated the ability of the method to learn predominant senses and induce word sense distributions, based on a broad range of datasets and two separate sense inventories</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The authors evaluated their method in terms of wsd accuracy over a given corpus, based on assigning all instances of a target word with the predominant sense learned from that corpus</a>
