<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Moreover, once the learner observes a new object, she can easily construct a full visual representation for it (and the acquisition literature has shown that humans are wired for good object segmentation and recognition [ 50 ] ) u'\u2013' the more challenging task is to scan the ongoing and very ambiguous linguistic communication for contexts that might be relevant and informative about the new object</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For ESP, given the size and amount of noise in this dataset, we build vectors for visual concepts , by normalizing and summing the BoVW vectors of all the images that have the relevant concept as a tag</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Furthermore, since not all new concepts in the linguistic environment refer to new objects (they might denote abstract concepts or out-of-scene objects), it seems more reasonable for the learner to be more alerted to linguistic cues about a recently-spotted new object than vice versa</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We show that the induced cross-modal semantic space is powerful enough that sensible guesses about the correct word denoting an object can be made, even when the linguistic context vector representing the word</a>
