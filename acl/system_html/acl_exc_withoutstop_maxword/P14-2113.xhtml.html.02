<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As the first work that predicts sentence-level sentiment for online discussions, we investigate isotonic Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [ 16 ] for the sentiment-tagging task as they preserve the advantages of the popular CRF-based sequential tagging models [ 15 ] while providing an efficient mechanism for encoding domain knowledge u'\u2014' in our case, a sentiment lexicon u'\u2014' through isotonic constraints on model parameters</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given that traditional Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) [ 15 ] ignore the ordinal relations among sentiment labels, we choose isotonic CRFs [ 16 ] for sentence-level sentiment analysis as they can enforce monotonicity constraints on the parameters consistent with the ordinal structure and domain knowledge (e.g., word-level sentiment conveyed via a lexicon</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Existing studies of collaborative knowledge systems have shown, however, that the quality of the generated content (e.g., an encyclopedia article) is highly correlated with the effectiveness of the online collaboration [ 12 , 14 ] ; fruitful collaboration, in turn, inevitably requires dealing with the disputes</a>
