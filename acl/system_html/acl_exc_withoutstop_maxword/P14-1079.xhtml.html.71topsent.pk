VMore specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels
p1
aVSuppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d -dimensional textual features, and t labels (relations), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al
p2
aVIn such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank
p3
aVOur models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al
p4
aVDue to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high
p5
aVSimilar to noisy features, the generated labels can be incomplete
p6
aVFor example, the second relation mention in Figure 1 does not explicitly describe any relation instance, so features extracted from this sentence can be noisy
p7
aVAs we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models
