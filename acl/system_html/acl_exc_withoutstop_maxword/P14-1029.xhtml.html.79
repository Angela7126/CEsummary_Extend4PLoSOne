<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That is, the model parameters are only based on the sentiment value of the arguments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that the two neural network based models incorporate the syntax and semantics by representing each node with a vector</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Following the idea of , we regard the sentiment of p 1 as a prior sentiment as it has not been affected by the specific context (negators), so we denote our method as prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We regard the negators u'\u2019' behavior as an underlying function embedded in annotated data; we aim to model this function from different aspects</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This shifting model is based on negators and the polarity of the text they modify constants can be different for each negator-polarity pair</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As we have discussed above, we will use the human annotated sentiment for the arguments, same as in the models discussed in Section 3</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>With the new matrix and tensor, we then have u'\u0398' = ( V , V s u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' n , W , W s u'\u2062'</a>
