VHowever, in the following experiments, due to efficiency considerations, we use the u'\u005cu201c' tight u'\u005cu201d' rule extraction in cdec that is more strict than the standard u'\u005cu201c' loose u'\u005cu201d' rule extraction, which generates a reduced rule set and, thus, a reduced reachability

aVIf a boundary word does not occur in the reference, its index is set to u'\u005cu221e' so that its language model score will always be - u'\u005cu221e' ; if a boundary word occurs more than once in the reference, its - u'\u005cu2062' LM node is split into multiple + u'\u005cu2062' LM nodes, one for each such index
