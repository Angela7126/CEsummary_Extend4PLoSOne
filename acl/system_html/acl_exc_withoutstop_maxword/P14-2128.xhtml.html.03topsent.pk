VResults are listed in Table 1, where row 2 and row 3 list the UAS of words (all excluding punctuations) on the development and test set, respectively
p1
aVTo see this, we evaluate the parsing accuracies of the selected parsers on words and punctuations, separately
p2
aVBefore parsing starts and after the preprocessing step for paired punctuations, our method employs a second preprocessing step to attach non-paired punctuations to their left neighbouring words
p3
aVIn our method, punctuations are treated as properties of its neighbouring words
p4
aVIn this method, punctuations are not associated with lexical heads, but are treated as properties of their neighbouring words
p5
aVBefore parsing starts, a preprocessing step is used to first attach the paired punctuations as properties of their neighbouring words,
