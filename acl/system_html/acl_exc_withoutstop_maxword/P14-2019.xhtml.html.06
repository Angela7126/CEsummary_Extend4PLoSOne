<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When we have a sufficiently rich corpus of parallel trees, our next step is to train a SMT learner to imitate the human translator who operates under our restricted set of operations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Still, having a common set of rules and heuristics helps the translators in both consistency and speed</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These include 8660 trees from the training set of the Penn Treebank, 360 trees from its development set and 540 trees from its test set</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Naturally, human translators often base their transformation decisions on the whole tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When translating English trees, we permute its shallow subtrees to reflect the change of constituent order in Turkish</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order to constrain the syntactic complexity of the sentences in the corpus, we selected from the Penn Treebank II 9560 trees which contain a maximum of 15 tokens</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our approach converts English parse trees into equivalent Turkish parse trees by applying several transformation heuristics</a>
