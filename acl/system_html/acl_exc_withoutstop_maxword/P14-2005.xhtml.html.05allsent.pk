VIn particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e.,, links among mentions within entities) and response coreference links, while non-coreference links (i.e.,, links formed by mentions from different entities) are not explicitly taken into account
p1
aVWe use key to refer to gold standard mentions or entities, and response to refer to system mentions or entities
p2
aVThe BLANC-gold metric was developed with the assumption that response mentions and key mentions are identical
p3
aVHowever, when response mentions are not identical to key mentions, a key coreference link may not appear in either C r or N r , so Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) cannot be applied directly to systems with imperfect mentions
p4
aVB-cubed and CEAF treat entities as sets of mentions and measure the agreement between key (or gold standard) entities and response (or system-generated) entities, while MUC and BLANC-gold are link-based
p5
aVThis is the case where the key and response side has only entities consisting of singleton mentions
p6
aVIn fact, the proposed BLANC metric subsumes the original one in that its value is identical to the original one when response mentions are identical to key mentions
p7
aVThis is the case where all mentions in the key and response are in one entity
p8
aVKey entity is { a } ; response entity is { b }
p9
aVFor instance, if the key entities are { a,b,c } { d,e }; and the response entities are { b,c } { e,f,g }, then the key coreference link (a,b) is not seen on the response side; similarly, it is possible that a response link does not appear on the key side either c,f) and (f,g) are not in the key in the above example
p10
aVFor example, R c is the ratio of the number of correct coreference links over the number of key coreference links; P c is the ratio of the number of correct coreference links over the number of response coreference links, and so on
p11
aVBLANC [ 7 ] , on the other hand, considers both coreference links and non-coreference links
p12
aVCoreference resolution aims at identifying natural language expressions (or mentions) that refer to the same entity
p13
aVIn reality, however, mentions need to be detected from natural language text and the result is, more often than not, imperfect some key mentions may be missing in the response, and some response mentions may be spurious u'\u005cu2014' so-called u'\u005cu201c' twinless u'\u005cu201d' mentions by Stoyanov et al
p14
aVTo account for missing or spurious links, we observe that x u'\u005cu2219' C k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' N k u'\u005cu2216' T r are key non-coreference links missing in the response; x u'\u005cu2219' C r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response coreference links missing in the key; x u'\u005cu2219' N r u'\u005cu2216' T k are response non-coreference links missing in the key, and we propose to extend the coreference F-measure and non-coreference F-measure as follows
p15
aVThe goal of this paper is to extend the BLANC-gold metric to imperfect response mentions
p16
aVR is the set of response entities, and r j is the j t u'\u005cu2062' h response entity
p17
aVUsing the notations in Section 2 , the recall, precision, and F-measure on coreference links are
p18
aVWhen T k = T r , Rand Index can be applied directly since coreference resolution reduces to a clustering problem where mentions are partitioned into clusters (entities
p19
aVThis is boundary case (2 there are no coreference links
p20
aVNote that when an entity consists of a single mention, its coreference link set is empty
p21
aVIt calculates recall, precision and F-measure separately on coreference and non-coreference links in the usual way, and defines the overall recall, precision and F-measure as the mean of the respective measures for coreference and non-coreference links
p22
aVNote that the non-coreference link set is empty when all mentions are in the same entity
p23
aVIt is easy to see that the gold mention assumption u'\u005cu2014' same set of response mentions as the set of key mentions u'\u005cu2014' can be equivalently stated as T k = T r (this does not necessarily mean that C k = C r or N k = N r
p24
aVThis leads to a phenomenon where coreference systems outputting large entities are scored more favorably than those outputting small entities [ 3 ]
p25
aVWe say that a key link l 1 u'\u005cu2208' T k equals a response link l 2 u'\u005cu2208' T r if and only if the pair of mentions from which the links are formed are identical
p26
aVWe use T k = C k u'\u005cu222a' N k and T r = C r u'\u005cu222a' N r to denote the total set of key links and total set of response links, respectively
p27
aVKey entities are { a } u'\u005cu2062' { b } u'\u005cu2062' { c } ; response entities are { a } u'\u005cu2062' { b } u'\u005cu2062' { d }
p28
aVSince there is no non-coreference link, BLANC reduces to the coreference F-measure F c
p29
aVSince there is no coreference link, BLANC reduces to the non-coreference F-measure F n
p30
aVM k and M r are the key and response mention set
p31
aVCoreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to
p32
aVUnder the assumption that the key and response mention sets are identical (which implies that T k = T r ), Equations ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) make sense
p33
aVKey entity is { a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' c } ; response entity is { b u'\u005cu2062' c }
p34
aVA critically important problem is how to measure the quality of a coreference resolution system
p35
aVRand Index is defined as the ratio between the number of correct within-cluster links plus the number of correct cross-cluster links, and the total number of links
p36
aVLet C k u'\u005cu2062' ( i ) and C r u'\u005cu2062' ( j ) be the set of coreference links formed by mentions in k i and r j
p37
aVBLANC-gold solves this problem by averaging the F-measure computed over coreference links and the F-measure over non-coreference links
p38
aVFigure 1 shows how the proposed BLANC measure works when compared with existing metrics such as MUC, B-cubed and CEAF, using the BLANC and F1 scores
p39
aVKey entities are { a u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' c } and { d } ; response entities are { b u'\u005cu2062' c } and { d u'\u005cu2062' e }
p40
aVTherefore, the identical-mention-set assumption limits BLANC-gold u'\u005cu2019' s applicability when gold mentions are not available, or when one wants to have a single score measuring both the quality of mention detection and coreference resolution
p41
aVHowever, the CoNLL data sets come from OntoNotes [ 2 ] , where singleton entities are not annotated, and BLANC has a wider dynamic range on data sets with singletons [ 7 ]
p42
aVIn practice, though, the simple-minded adoption of Rand Index is not satisfactory since the number of non-coreference links often overwhelms that of coreference links [ 7 ] , or
p43
aVIt entails partitioning (often imperfect) mentions into equivalence classes
p44
aVThis paves the way to generalize it to imperfect system mentions, which is presented in Section 4
p45
aVSuperscript g in these equations highlights the fact that they are meant for coreference systems with gold mentions
p46
aVWe have updated the publicly available CoNLL coreference scorer 1 1 http://code.google.com/p/reference-coreference-scorers with the proposed BLANC, and used it to compute the proposed BLANC scores for all the CoNLL 2011 [ 5 ] and 2012 [ 4 ] participants in the official track, where participants had to automatically predict the mentions
p47
aVSimilarly, the recall, precision, and F-measure on non-coreference links are computed as
p48
aVThe collection of key entities is denoted by K = { k i } i = 1
p49
aVWe first briefly review the original definition of BLANC, and rewrite its definition using set notation
p50
aVThis is boundary case (3 there are no non-coreference links
p51
aVBLANC = 0
p52
aVSo the correlations will likely be lower on data sets with singleton entities
p53
aVThe proposed BLANC is applied to the CoNLL 2011 and 2012 shared task participants, and the scores and its correlations with existing metrics are shown in Section 5
p54
aVAs can be seen, a link is an undirected edge between two mentions, and it can be equivalently represented by a pair of mentions
p55
aVRand Index, if used without modification, would not be sensitive to changes of coreference links
p56
aVEqn. ( 8 ) indicates that BLANC-gold assigns equal weight to F c ( g ) , the F-measure from coreference links, and F n ( g ) , the F-measure from non-coreference links
p57
aVWe assume that mentions in { k i } and { r j } are unique; in other words, there is no duplicate mention
p58
aVWe then present the original BLANC-gold in Section 3 using the set notation defined in Section 2
p59
aVIn all the examples below, each lower-case letter represents a mention; mentions in an entity are closed in {}; two letters in () represent a link
p60
aVLet N k u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) ( i u'\u005cu2260' j ) be key non-coreference links formed between mentions in k i and those in k j , and let N r u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) ( i u'\u005cu2260' j ) be response non-coreference links formed between mentions in r i and those in r j , respectively
p61
aVThe proposed BLANC is highly positively correlated with the other measures along R, P and F1 (Table 3 ), showing that BLANC is able to capture most entity-based similarities measured by B-cubed and CEAF
p62
aVThis can happen when all key (or response) mentions are in one cluster or are all singletons the former case will lead to N k = u'\u005cu2205' (or N r = u'\u005cu2205' ); the latter will lead to C k = u'\u005cu2205' (or C r = u'\u005cu2205'
p63
aVNon-coreference recall, precision and F-measure are changed to
p64
aVThis is boundary case (1
p65
aV0 , then BLANC = F c
p66
aV0 , then BLANC = F n
p67
aVMany evaluation metrics have been proposed in the past two decades, including the MUC measure [ 9 ] , B-cubed [ 1 ] , CEAF [ 3 ] and, more recently, BLANC-gold [ 7 ]
p68
aVSo the final definition of BLANC can be succinctly stated as
p69
aVSo BLANC = F n = 1 3
p70
aVFinally, BLANC = 17 35
p71
aVWe introduce the notions used in this paper in Section 2
p72
aVCare has to be taken when counts of the BLANC definition are 0
p73
aVK where k i is the i t u'\u005cu2062' h key entity; accordingly, R = { r j } j = 1
p74
aVWe then argue that the gold-mention assumption in Recasens and Hovy ( 2011 ) can be lifted without changing the original definition
p75
aVThe proposed BLANC continues to be the arithmetic average of F c and F n
p76
aVSo we only need to augment the BLANC definition for the following cases
p77
aVWe write l 1 = l 2 if two links are equal
p78
aVWe observe that the definition of the proposed BLANC, Equ. ( 9 )-( 14 ) subsume the BLANC-gold ( 2 ) to ( 7 ) due to the following proposition
p79
aVC r should the original Rand Index be used
p80
aVBLANC-gold is adapted from Rand Index [ 6 ] , a metric for clustering objects
p81
aVWe walk through a few examples and show how BLANC is calculated in detail
p82
aVThe rest of the paper is organized as follows
p83
aVThis can happen when a document has no more than one mention and there is no link
p84
aVThis avoids the problem that
p85
aVWe also use u'\u005cu22c5' to denote the size of a set
p86
aVWe use the same letter and subscription without the index in parentheses to denote the union of sets, e.g

aVTo facilitate the presentation, we define the notations used in the paper

p90
aV1) If C k = C r = u'\u005cu2205' and N k = N r = u'\u005cu2205' , then BLANC = I ( M k = M r ) , where I u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is an indicator function whose value is 1 if its argument is true, and 0 otherwise
p91
aVTables 1 and 2 report the updated results
p92
aV2 2 The order is kept the same as in Pradhan et al

p94
aVSince C k = { ( a u'\u005cu2062' b ) , ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) , ( c u'\u005cu2062' a ) } , and C r = { ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) } , we have C k u'\u005cu2229' C r = { ( b u'\u005cu2062' c ) } , and R c = 1 3 , P c = 1 , So BLANC = F c = 2 4 = 1 2
p95
aVWe would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers for their invaluable suggestions for improving the paper
p96
aVObserve that as long as
p97
aVLikewise, C r and N r form a partition of T r
p98
aVUnification for other component recalls and precisions can be done similarly
p99
aVIn Eqn. ( 2 ) - ( 3 ) and Eqn. ( 5 ) - ( 6 ), denominators are written as a sum of disjoint subsets so they can be related to the contingency table in [ 7 ]
p100
aVUnder the assumption that T k = T r , it is clear that C k = ( C k u'\u005cu2229' C r ) u'\u005cu222a' ( C k u'\u005cu2229' N r ) , C r = ( C k u'\u005cu2229' C r ) u'\u005cu222a' ( N k u'\u005cu2229' C r ) , and so on
p101
aVIndeed, since C k is a union of three disjoint subsets
p102
aV0 , F c in ( 18 ) is well-defined; as long as
p103
aVClearly, C k and N k form a partition of T k since C k u'\u005cu2229' N k = u'\u005cu2205' , T k = C k u'\u005cu222a' N k
p104
aVWe only need to show that R c = R c ( g ) , P c = P c ( g ) , R n = R n ( g ) , and P n = P n ( g

aVProof
