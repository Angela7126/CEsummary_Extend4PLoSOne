VDuring training we report the out-of-sample NMI, calculated by holding the word proportions u'\u005cu03a6' fixed, running five sweeps of collapsed Gibbs sampling on the test set, and computing the topic for each document as the topic assigned to the most tokens in that document

aVIn the experiments of Börschinger and Johnson ( 2012 ) , the particle cloud appears to be resampled once per utterance with a large rejuvenation sequence; 4 4 The ESS threshold is P ; the rejuvenation sequence is 100 or 1600 utterances, almost one sixth of the training data each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler

aVThe variance of the particle filter is often large, so for each experiment we perform 30 runs and plot the mean NMI inside bands spanning one sample standard
