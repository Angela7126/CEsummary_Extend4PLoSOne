<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As for improving distributional thesauri, outside of numerous alternate approaches to the construction, there is a body of work focusing on improving an existing resource, for instance reweighting context features once an initial thesaurus is built [] , or post-processing the resource to filter bad neighbours or re-ranking neighbours of a given target []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard []</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A distributional thesaurus includes a lot of u'\u201c' noise u'\u201d' from a semantic point of view, but also lists relevant lexical pairs that escape classical lexical relations such as synonymy or hypernymy</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We present the experiments we set up to automatically filter semantic relations in context, with various groups of features that take into account information from the corpus used to build the thesaurus and contextual information related to occurrences of semantic neighbours 3</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In extrinsic evaluations, models are evaluated against benchmarks focusing on a single task or a single aspect of a resource either discriminative, TOEFL-like tests [] , analogy production [] , or synonym selection []</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The filtering approach we propose seems to yield good results, by augmenting</a>
