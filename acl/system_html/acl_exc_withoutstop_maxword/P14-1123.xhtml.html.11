<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The result is a new measure based on POS bigrams to assess ESL learners u'\u2019' mastery of syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The idea that the level of syntactic complexity (in terms of its range and sophistication) can be assessed based on the distribution of POS-tags is informed by prior studies in second language acquisition</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The syntactic complexity of a test spoken response was estimated based on its similarity to the proficiency groups in the reference corpus with respect to the score-specific constructions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Grammatical expressions that occur frequently in one score level but rarely in other levels can be assumed to be characteristic of a specific score level</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then, regarding POS bigrams as terms, they construct POS-based vector space models for each score-class (there are four score classes</a>
