<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By concentrating on citation polarity we are able to compare our classification to previous citation polarity work</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We follow much of the recent work on citation classification and concentrate on citation polarity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We treat citation polarity classification as a sentiment analysis domain adaptation task and therefore must be careful not to define features that are too domain specific</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data</a>
