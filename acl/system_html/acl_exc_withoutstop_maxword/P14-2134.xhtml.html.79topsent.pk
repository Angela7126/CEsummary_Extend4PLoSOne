VThe model we introduce is grounded in the distributional hypothesis [] , that two words are similar by appearing in the same kinds of contexts (where u'\u005cu201c' context u'\u005cu201d' itself can be variously defined as the bag or sequence of tokens around a target word, either by linear distance or dependency path

aVIn the absence of a sizable number of linguistically interesting terms (like wicked ) that are known to be geographically variable, we consider the proxy of estimating the named entities evoked by specific terms in different geographical regions

aVA joint model has three a priori advantages over independent models i) sharing data across variable values encourages representations across those values to be similar; e.g.,, while city may be closer to Boston in Massachusetts and Chicago in Illinois, in both places it still generally connotes a municipality ; (ii) such sharing can mitigate data sparseness for less-witnessed areas; and (iii) with a joint model, all representations are guaranteed to be in the same vector space and can therefore be compared to each other; with individual models (each with different initializations), word vectors across different states may not be directly
