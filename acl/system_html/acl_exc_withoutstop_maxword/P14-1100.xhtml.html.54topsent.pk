VFollowing this intuition, we propose to model the distribution over the latent bracketing states and words for each tag sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' as a latent tree graphical model, which encodes conditional independences among the words given the latent states

aVAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p2
aVIn particular we leverage the concept of additive tree metrics [ Buneman1971 , Buneman1974 ] in phylogenetics and machine learning that can create a special distance metric among the observed variables as a function of the underlying spectral dependencies [ Choi et al.2011 , Song et al.2011 , Anandkumar
