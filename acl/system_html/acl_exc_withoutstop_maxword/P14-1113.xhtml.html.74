<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This paper proposes a novel approach for semantic hierarchy construction based on word embeddings</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We have made similar obsevation that about a half of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations are absent in a Chinese semantic thesaurus</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>
