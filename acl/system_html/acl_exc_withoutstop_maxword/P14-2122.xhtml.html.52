<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Many languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>UWS learns from unsegmented raw text, which are available in large quantities, and thus it has the potential to provide more accurate and adaptive segmentation than supervised approaches with less development effort being required</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus</a>
