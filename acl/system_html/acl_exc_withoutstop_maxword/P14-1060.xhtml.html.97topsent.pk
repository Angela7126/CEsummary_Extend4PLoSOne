VWe describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision
p1
aVThis would involve initializing the weights prior to the semi-supervised procedure with the weights from the supervised learning model, so as to seed the semi-supervised approach with reasonable model, and use the partially annotated data to fine-tune the supervised model
p2
aVImplicitly, the weight learning algorithm can be seen as a gradient descent procedure minimizing the difference between the scores of highest scoring (Viterbi) state sequences, and the label state sequences
p3
aVSection 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmentation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications
p4
aVHence, in this case, we use a variation of the hard EM algorithm for learning
p5
aVWhile the Viterbi algorithm can be used for tagging optimal state-sequences given the weights, the structured perceptron can learn optimal model weights given gold-standard sequence labels
p6
aVWe present a framework for extending distributional semantics to learn semantic representations of both words and phrases in terms of recurrent motifs, rather than arbitrary word tokens
p7
aVFor this task, the motif based distributional embeddings vastly outperform a conventional distributional model (DSM) based on token distributions, as well as additive (AVM) and multiplicative (MVM) models of vector compositionality, as proposed by Lapata et al
p8
aVUpdates are run for a large number of iterations until the change in objective drops below a threshold, and the learning rate u'\u005cu0391' is adaptively modified as described in Collins et al
p9
aVFor composing the motifs representations to get judgments on semantic similarity of sentences, we use our recent Vector
