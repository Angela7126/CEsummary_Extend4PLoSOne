<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Existing unsupervised approaches to keyphrase extraction can be categorized into four groups</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>With the goal of providing directions for future work, we identify the errors commonly made by state-of-the-art keyphrase extractors below</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Another unsupervised approach to keyphrase extraction involves grouping the candidate keyphrases in a document into topics , such that each topic is composed of all and only those candidate keyphrases that are related to that topic [ 13 , 33 , 32 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Research on supervised approaches to keyphrase extraction has focused on two issues task reformulation and feature design</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the Ben Johnson example, many keyphrase extractors fail to identify 100-meter dash and gold medal as keyphrases, resulting in infrequency errors</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Each node of the graph corresponds to a candidate keyphrase from the document and an edge connects two related candidates</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Recall that the goal of keyphrase extraction is to identify the most representative phrases for a document</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Intuitively, keyphrase extraction is about finding</a>
