VThe structural similarity component, instead, is a novel graph-based similarity measurement technique which calculates the similarity between a pair of concepts across the semantic networks of the two resources by leveraging the semantic structure of those networks
p1
aVInstead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures
p2
aVThe definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources [ 27 , 12 ]
p3
aVThe other two resources, i.e.,, wt and ow , do not provide a reliable network of semantic relations, therefore we used our ontologization approach to construct their corresponding semantic graphs
p4
aVHowever, not all lexical resources provide explicit semantic relations between concepts and, hence,
