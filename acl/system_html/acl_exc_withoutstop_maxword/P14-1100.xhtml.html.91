<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u201c' backwards u'\u201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This means our decoder first identifies (given a POS sequence) an undirected tree, and then orients it by applying h dir on the resulting tree (see below</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Unlike in phylogenetics and graphical models, where a single latent tree is constructed for all the data, in our case, each part of speech sequence is associated with its own parse tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, due to the presence of latent variables, structure learning of latent trees is substantially more</a>
