<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This would involve initializing the weights prior to the semi-supervised procedure with the weights from the supervised learning model, so as to seed the semi-supervised approach with reasonable model, and use the partially annotated data to fine-tune the supervised model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Section 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmentation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We present a framework for extending distributional semantics to learn semantic representations of both words and phrases in terms of recurrent motifs, rather than arbitrary word tokens</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While the Viterbi algorithm can be used for tagging optimal state-sequences given the weights, the structured perceptron can learn optimal model weights given gold-standard sequence labels</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Implicitly, the weight learning algorithm can be seen as a gradient descent procedure minimizing the difference between the scores of highest scoring (Viterbi) state sequences, and the label state sequences</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For this task, the motif based model is expected to perform well as common metaphorical usage is generally through idiosyncratic MWEs, which the motif based models is specially geared to capture through the features of the segmentation model</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For this task, the motif based distributional embeddings vastly outperform a conventional distributional model (DSM) based on token distributions, as well as additive (AVM) and multiplicative (MVM) models of vector compositionality, as proposed by Lapata et al</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Hence, we use the Hellinger measure between neighbourhood motif distributions in learning representations</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Given constituent motifs of each sentence in the data, we can now define neighbourhood</a>
