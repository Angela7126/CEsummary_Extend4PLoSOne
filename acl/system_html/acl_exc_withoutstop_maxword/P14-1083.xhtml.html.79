<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The structured perceptron algorithm [ Collins2002 ] learns an optimal weight vector w by updating w on input x ( i ) by the following rule, in case the predicted translation y ^ is different from and scored higher than the reference translation y ( i )</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Building on prior work in grounded semantic parsing, we generate translations of queries, and receive feedback by executing semantic parses of translated queries against the database</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Firstly, update rules that require to compute a feature representation for the reference translation are suboptimal in SMT, because often human-generated reference translations cannot be generated by the SMT system</a>
