<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The other uses the traditional Stanford NER to extract named entities from news articles published in the same period and then perform fuzzy matching to identify named entities from tweets</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Firstly, a named entity recognizer [ 13 ] is employed to identify named entities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We have also used a named entity tagger trained specifically on the Twitter data 3 3 http://github.com/aritter/twitter-nlp [ 13 ] to directly extract named entities from tweets</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First, a traditional NER tool such as the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer 2 2 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml is used to identify named entities from the news articles crawled from BBC and CNN during the same period that the tweets were published</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The recognised named entities from news are then used to build a dictionary</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations</a>
