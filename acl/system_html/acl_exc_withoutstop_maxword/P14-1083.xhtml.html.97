<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Lexical and structural variants of reference translations can be used to boost model parameters towards translations with positive feedback, while the same translations might be considered as negative examples in standard structured learning</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Table 5 shows examples where translations from Rebol and Rampion differ from the gold standard reference, and predictions by Rebol lead to positive feedback, while predictions by Rampion lead to negative feedback</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In case of positive feedback, the predicted translation can be treated as reference translation for a structured learning update</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rebol u'\u2019' s combination of task feedback with a cost function achieves the best results since positively executable hypotheses and reference translations can both be exploited to guide the learning process</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It does not make use of the semantic parser, but defines positive and negative examples based on score s and cost c with respect to human reference translations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference</a>
