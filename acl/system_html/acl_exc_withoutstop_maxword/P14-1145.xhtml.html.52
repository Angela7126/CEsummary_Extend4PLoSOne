<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore in this work, we employ a computationally tractable (in fact linearly scalable with network size) approximate inference algorithm called Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) [ 37 ] , which we extend to handle typed graphs like our connotation graph</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, we note that using the unweighted versions of the graphs provide relatively more robust performance, potentially due to noise in the relative edge weights</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We experiment with SemEval dataset [ 28 ] that includes the human labeled dataset for predicting whether a news headline is a good news or a bad news , which we expect to have a correlation with the use of connotative words that we focus on in this paper</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These factors are referred to as clique potentials in general MRFs, which are essentially functions that collectively determine the graph u'\u2019' s joint probability</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>MRFs are a class of probabilistic graphical</a>
