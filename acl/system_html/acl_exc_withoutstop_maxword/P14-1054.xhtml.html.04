<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>[] also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the following experiments, focusing on Chinese relation extraction, we will analyze the performance of candidate feature sets and study the influence of the constraint conditions</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u201c' soft constraint u'\u201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By-Segmentation denotes the traditional segmentation based feature set generated by a segmentation tool, collecting every output of relation mention</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>[] experimented with different kernel methods and inferred that simply migrating from English kernel methods can result in a bad performance in Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because the number of lexicon entry determines the dimension of the feature space, performance of Omni-word feature is influenced by the lexicon being employed</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses</a>
