<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, the inclusion of the MaxEnt-based measure of syntactic complexity results in improved agreement between machine and human scores compared to the state-of-the-art model (here, Base</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Taking an approach different from previous studies, we formulate the task of assigning a score of syntactic complexity to a spoken response as a classification problem given a spoken response, assign the response to a proficiency class</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Seeking to study the robustness of the measures derived using a shallow analysis, we next compare the two measures studied here, with respect to the impact of speech recognition errors on their correlation with scores of syntactic complexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
