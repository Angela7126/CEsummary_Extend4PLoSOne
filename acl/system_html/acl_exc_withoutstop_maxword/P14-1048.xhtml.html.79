<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Because the structure model is the first component in our pipeline of local models, its accuracy is crucial</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For each sentence S k with m k EDUs, the overall time complexity to perform intra-sentential parsing is O u'\u2062' ( m k 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After an intra- or multi-sentential discourse tree is fully built, we perform a post-editing to consider possible modifications to the current tree, by considering useful information from the discourse constituents on upper levels, which is unavailable in the bottom-up tree-building process</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Each sentence S i , after being segmented into EDUs (not shown in the figure), goes through an intra-sentential bottom-up tree-building model M i u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' a , to form a sentence-level discourse tree T S i , with the EDUs as leaf nodes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is possible to optimize Joty et al u'\u2019' s CKY-like parsing by replacing their CRF-based computation for upper-level constituents with some local computation based on the probabilities of lower-level constituents</a>
