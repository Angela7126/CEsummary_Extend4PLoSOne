p9
aVCollobert et al
p10
aVCompared with Mansur et al
p11
aVA very common feature in Chinese word segmentation is the character bigram feature
p12
aVIn our model, the bigram features are extracted in the window context and then the corresponding bigram embeddings are concatenated with character embeddings in Layer 1 and fed into Layer 2
p13
aVFollowing Mansur et al
p14
aV[ 35 ] followed the model proposed by Collobert et al
p15
aV[ 15 ] used the model proposed by Bengio et al
p16
aVPrevious work found that the performance can be improved by pre-training the character embeddings on large unlabeled data and using the obtained embeddings to initialize the character lookup table instead of random initialization [ 15 , 35 ]
p17
aV[ 15 ] proposed the feature-based neural network where each context feature is represented as feature embeddings
p18
aV[ 6 ] and Zheng et al
p19
aVSince Zheng et al
p20
aVGiven the long time for pre-training bigram embeddings, we only pre-train the character embeddings and the bigram embeddings are initialized as the average of character embeddings of c k and c k + 1
p21
aVZhang et al
p22
aVWe propose a Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network for Chinese word segmentation without feature engineering
p23
aV[ 1 ] which learns the embeddings based on neural language model
p24
aVThe idea of feature embeddings is similar to that of character embeddings described in section 2.1
p25
aVIn order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation
p26
aVExperiment results show that our model outperforms other neural network models
p27
aVLike Collobert et al
p28
aVThe test results on the benchmark dataset show that our model outperforms previous neural network models
p29
aVGiven the sentence-level score, Zheng et al
p30
aVTo explain why distributed representation captures more information than discrete features, we show in Table 4 the effect of character embeddings which are obtained from the lookup table of MMTNN after training
p31
aVFirst, the discrete feature vector is replaced with dense character embeddings
p32
aVThe input feature to the CRF model is simply the context characters (unigram feature) without any additional feature engineering
p33
aVTherefore, we integrate additional simple character bigram features into our model and the result shows that our model can achieve a competitive performance that other systems hardly achieve unless they use more complex task-specific features
p34
aVWe also compare our model with the CRF model [ 13 ] , which is a widely used log-linear model for Chinese word segmentation
p35
aVIt is a competitive result given that our model only use simple bigram features while other models use more complex features
p36
aVFor example, Sun et al
p37
aVSimilar to character embeddings, given a fixed-sized tag set T , the tag embeddings for tags are stored in a tag embedding matrix L u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d ◊
p38
aVRecently, researchers have tended to explore new approaches for word segmentation which circumvent the feature engineering by automatically learning features with neural network models [ 15 , 35 ]
p39
aVFigure 2 shows the new Lookup Table layer with tag embeddings
p40
aV[ 35 ] applied the architecture of Collobert et al
p41
aVCompared with previous works that use a large number of handcrafted features, our model can achieve a competitive performance with minimal feature engineering
p42
aVThe multiplicative operations between tag embeddings and character embeddings can somehow be seen as u'\u005cu201c' feature combination u'\u005cu201d' , which are hand-designed in feature-based models
p43
aVFollowing Socher et al
p44
aVAnother important result in Table 3 is that our neural network models perform much better than CRF-based model when only unigram features are used
p45
aVBy introducing tensor factorization into the neural network model for sequence labeling tasks, the model training and inference are speeded up and overfitting is prevented
p46
aVFor example, Socher et al
p47
aVWe further compare our model with previous neural network models on both PKU and MSRA datasets
p48
aVOur model learns the information automatically and encodes them in tensor parameters and embeddings
p49
aVThe results are listed in the first three rows of Table 5, which shows that our model achieved higher F-score than the previous neural network models
p50
aVFor example, Chang et al
p51
aVIn conventional neural network models, however, the input embeddings only implicitly interact through the non-linear function which can hardly model the complexity of the interactions
p52
aVFormally, in the Chinese word segmentation task, we have a character dictionary D of size
p53
aVThe concatenation operation in Layer 1 then concatenates the character embeddings and tag embedding together into a long vector a
p54
aVWe evaluate the performance of Chinese word segmentation on the PKU and MSRA benchmark datasets in the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff [ 9 ] which are commonly used for evaluation of Chinese word segmentation
p55
aVMost previous systems address this task by using linear statistical models with carefully designed features such as bigram features, punctuation information [ 14 ] and statistical information [ 24 ]
p56
aVTable 6 lists the segmentation performances of our model as well as previous state-of-the-art systems
p57
aVAssuming we are at the i -th character of a sentence, besides the character embeddings, the tag embeddings of the previous tags are also considered 1 1 We also tried the architecture in which the tag embedding of current tag is also considered, but this did not bring much improvement and runs slower
p58
aVWe use the PKU and MSRA data provided by the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff [ 9 ] to test our model
p59
aVThe Lookup Table layer can be seen as a simple projection layer where the character embedding for each context character is achieved by table lookup operation according to their indices
p60
aVTo better model the tag-tag interaction given the context characters, distributed representation for tags instead of traditional discrete symbolic representation is used in our model
p61
aVThey are commonly used by previous state-of-the-art models and neural network models
p62
aVMoreover, the transition score in equation (4) is not necessary in our model, because, by incorporating tag embedding into the neural network, the effect of tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction are covered uniformly in one same model
p63
aVMoreover, the simple non-linear transformation in equation (2) is also poor to model the complex interactional effects in Chinese word segmentation
p64
aVCompared with CRF, there are two differences in neural network models
p65
aVSince vector a is the concatenation of character embeddings and the tag embedding, equation (7) can be written in the following form
p66
aVThe character embeddings extracted by the Lookup Table layer are then concatenated into a single vector a u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 , where H 1 = w u'\u005cu22c5' d is the size of Layer 1
p67
aVRecently, neural network models have been increasingly focused on for their ability to minimize the effort in feature engineering
p68
aVDespite tensor-based transformation being effective for capturing the interactions, introducing tensor-based transformation into neural network models to solve sequence labeling task is time prohibitive since the tensor product operation drastically slows down the model
p69
aVThere are several ways to learn the embeddings on unlabeled data
p70
aVIn Chinese word segmentation, the most prevalent tag set T is BMES tag set, which uses 4 tags to carry word boundary information
p71
aVFormally, we assume the extracted features form a feature dictionary D f
p72
aVT where d is the dimensionality of the vector space (same with character embeddings
p73
aVFurther improvement could be obtained if the bigram embeddings are also pre-trained
p74
aVTensor-based transformation was also used in other neural network models for its ability to capture multiple interactions in data
p75
aVWe pre-train the embeddings on the Chinese Giga-word corpus [ 10 ]
p76
aVTo model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u005cu2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u005cu2208' T to tag j u'\u005cu2208' T
p77
aVHowever, the ability of these models is restricted by the design of features and the number of features could be so large that the result models are too large for practical use and prone to overfit on training corpus
p78
aVThe character embeddings are then stacked into a embedding matrix M u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d ◊
p79
aVWhen bigram features are added, the F-score of our model improves from 94.0% to 95.2% on PKU dataset and from 94.9% to 97.2% on MSRA dataset
p80
aVSince feature engineering is not the main focus of this paper, we did not experiment with more features
p81
aVThey constructed a neural network that outputs high scores for windows that occur in the corpus and low scores for windows where one character is replaced by a random one
p82
aVOur study is consistent with this line of research, however, our model explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters and accordingly captures more semantic information
p83
aV[ 15 ] , we wonder how well our model can perform with minimal feature engineering
p84
aVTherefore, compared with discrete feature representations, distributed representation can capture the syntactic and semantic similarity between characters
p85
aVThe tag embeddings start from a random initialization and can be automatically trained by back-propagation
p86
aV[ 16 ] proposed a faster skip-gram model word2vec 5 5 https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/‚Äé which tries to maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence
p87
aV[ 6 ] to Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging and proposed a perceptron-style algorithm to speed up the training process with negligible loss in performance
p88
aVAs we can see, by using Tag embedding, the F-score is improved by +0.6% and OOV recall is improved by +1.0%, which shows that tag embeddings succeed in modeling the tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction
p89
aVAs we can see, in each tensor slice i , the embeddings are explicitly related in a bilinear form which captures the interactions between characters and tags
p90
aVIn previous neural network models, however, hardly can such interactional effects be fully captured relying only on the simple transition score and the single non-linear transformation (See section 2
p91
aVAn advantage of the tensor is that it can explicitly model multiple interactions in data
p92
aVTo capture more interactions, researchers have designed a large number of features based on linguistic intuition and statistical information
p93
aVWe will analyze in more detail about the effect of character embeddings in Section 4
p94
aVOur model still outperforms other models after pre-training
p95
aVFollowing their idea, we try to find out how well our model can perform with minimal feature engineering
p96
aV[ 15 ] modeled Chinese word segmentation as a series of classification task at each position of the sentence in which the tag score is transformed into probability using softmax function
p97
aVThe final hyperparameters of our model are set as in Table 2
p98
aVwhere the tag sequence is found and scored by the Tensor Neural Network via the function s in equation (6
p99
aVMoreover, we propose a tensor factorization approach that effectively improves the model efficiency and prevents from overfitting
p100
aVMoreover, the additional tensor could bring millions of parameters to the model which makes the model suffer from the risk of overfitting
p101
aVThe loss is proportional to the number of characters with an incorrect tag in the proposed tag sequence, which increases the more incorrect the proposed tag sequence is
p102
aVTherefore, word segmentation is a preliminary and important pre-process for Chinese language processing
p103
aVSection 2 describes the details of conventional neural network architecture
p104
aVThe idea of distributed representation for symbolic data is one of the most important reasons why the neural network works
p105
aVMost previous systems address this problem by treating this task as a sequence labeling problem where each character is assigned a tag indicating its position in the word
p106
aVIn conventional feature-based linear (log-linear) models, these interactions are explicitly modeled as features
p107
aVIn each column, we list the top 5 characters that are nearest (measured by Euclidean distance) to the corresponding character in the first row according to their embeddings
p108
aVModel performance is further boosted after using tensor-based transformation
p109
aVHowever, given the small size of their tensor matrix, they do not have the problem of high time cost and overfitting problem as we faced in modeling a sequence labeling task like Chinese word segmentation
p110
aVIn linear models, these kinds of interactions are usually modeled as features
p111
aVThese systems are effective because researchers can incorporate a large body of handcrafted features into the models
p112
aVIn Chinese word segmentation, a proper modeling of the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction is very important
p113
aV[ 32 ] uses eight types of features such as Mutual Information and Accessor Variety and they extract dynamic statistical features from both an in-domain corpus and an out-of-domain corpus using co-training
p114
aVWe first perform a close test 3 3 No other material or knowledge except the training data is allowed on the PKU dataset to show the effect of different model configurations
p115
aVWorkable as previous neural network models seem, a limitation of them to be pointed out is that the tag-tag interaction, tag-character interaction and character-character interaction are not well modeled
p116
aVThen each feature f u'\u005cu2208' D f is represented by a d -dimensional vector which is called feature embedding
p117
aVAs shown in Table 5 (last three rows), both the F-score and OOV recall of our model boost by using pre-training
p118
aVFor a fast tag inference, only the previous tag t i - 1 is used in our model even though a longer history of tags can be considered
p119
aVThe most popular approach treats word segmentation as a sequence labeling problem which was first proposed in Xue [ 31 ]
p120
aVSection 3 describes the details of our model
p121
aVAlthough we focus on the question that how far we can go without using feature engineering in this paper, the study of deep learning for NLP tasks is still a new area in which it is currently challenging to surpass the state-of-the-art without additional features
p122
aVAlthough we focus on the question that how far we can go without using feature engineering in this paper, the study of deep learning for NLP tasks is still a new area in which it is currently challenging to surpass the state-of-the-art without additional features
p123
aVThe window approach assumes that the tag of a character largely depends on its neighboring characters
p124
aVIn this way, the tag representation can be directly incorporated in the neural network so that the tag-tag interaction and tag-character interaction can be explicitly modeled in deeper layers (See Section 3.2
p125
aVThe dimensionality of character (tag) embedding is set to 25 which achieved the best performance and faster than 50- or 100-dimensional ones
p126
aVDespite Chinese word segmentation being a specific case, our approach can be easily generalized to other sequence labeling tasks
p127
aVIn fact, CRF can be regarded as a special neural network without non-linear function [ 30 ]
p128
aVFormally, at the i -th character of a sentence c [ 1 n ] , the bigram features are c k c k + 1 ( i - 3 k i + 2
p129
aVAs we can see, characters in the first column are all Chinese number characters and characters in the second column and the third column are all Chinese family names and Chinese punctuations respectively
p130
aVDetails of the data are listed in Table 1
p131
aVWe propose a new tensor factorization approach that models each tensor slice as the product of two low-rank matrices
p132
aVChinese word segmentation has been studied with considerable efforts in the NLP community
p133
aVDespite sharing commonalities mentioned above, previous work models the segmentation task differently and therefore uses different training and inference procedure
p134
aVIn this paper, we use word2vec because preliminary experiments did not show differences between performances of these models but word2vec is much faster to train
p135
aVThe simple tag-tag transition neglects the impact of context characters and thus limits the ability to capture flexible interactions between tags and context characters
p136
aVAs shown in Figure 1, at position c i , 1 u'\u005cu2264' i u'\u005cu2264' n , the context characters are fed into the Lookup Table layer
p137
aVTable 3 summarizes the test results
p138
aVWe found that 50 is a good trade-off between speed and model performance
p139
aVFor model selection, we use the first 90 u'\u005cu2062' % sentences in the training data for training and the rest 10 u'\u005cu2062' % sentences as development data
p140
aV[ 25 ] uses additional word-based features
p141
aV[ 35 ] did not report the results on the these datasets, we re-implemented their model and tested it on the test data
p142
aVWe use the Max-Margin criterion to train our model
p143
aVUnless otherwise specified, the character dictionary is extracted from the training set and unknown characters are mapped to a special symbol that is not used elsewhere
p144
aVThe model is then trained in MLE-style which maximizes the log-likelihood of the tagged data
p145
aVWe use an open source toolkit CRF++ 4 4 http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html?source=navbar to train the CRF model
p146
aVThe F-score is improved by +0.6% while OOV recall is improved by +3.2%, which denotes that tensor-based transformation captures more interactional information than simple non-linear transformation
p147
aVFor a character c u'\u005cu2208' D that has an associated index k , the corresponding character embedding E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d is retrieved by the Lookup Table layer as shown in Figure 1
p148
aVAs a result, the model can still perform well even if some words do not appear in the training cases
p149
aVObviously, it is a local model which cannot capture the dependency between tags and does not support to infer the tag sequence globally
p150
aVCombining the tensor product with linear transformation, the tensor-based transformation in Layer 2 is defined as
p151
aVWang and Manning [ 30 ] conduct an empirical study on the effect of non-linearity and the results suggest that non-linear models are highly effective only when distributed representation is used
p152
aV[ 15 ] , their model is a global one where the training and inference is performed at sentence-level
p153
aVFor a input sentence c [ 1 n ] with a tag sequence t [ 1 n ] , a sentence-level score is then given by the sum of transition and network scores
p154
aVIt uses B, M, E and S to denote the Beginning, the Middle, the End of a word and a Single character forming a word respectively
p155
aVAs a result, tensor-based model have been widely used in a variety of tasks [ 20 , 12 , 23 ]
p156
aVOur tensor factorization is related to these work but uses a different tensor factorization approach
p157
aVWorkable as these methods seem, one of the limitations of them is that the tag-tag interaction and the neural network are modeled seperately
p158
aV[ 35 ] , our model is also trained at sentence-level and carries out inference globally
p159
aVT is the score vector for each possible tag
p160
aVAll the neural networks are trained using the Max-Margin approach described in Section 3.4
p161
aV[ 35 ] proposed a perceptron-style training algorithm inspired by the work of Collins [ 5 ]
p162
aVAs long as r is small enough, the factorized tensor operation would be much faster than the un-factorized one and the number of free parameters would also be much smaller, which prevent the model from overfitting
p163
aVH 2 ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 2 ◊ H 1 ◊ H 1 to directly model the interactions, where H 2 is the size of Layer 2 and H 1 = ( w + 1 ) u'\u005cu22c5' d is the size of concatenated vector a in Layer 1 as shown in Figure 2
p164
aVVarious tensor factorization (decomposition) methods have been proposed recently for tensor-based dimension reduction [ 4 , 29 , 2 ]
p165
aV[ 2 ] proposed the Multi-Relational Latent Semantic Analysis
p166
aVTo remedy this, we propose a tensor factorization approach that factorizes each tensor slice as the product of two low-rank matrices
p167
aVEach character c u'\u005cu2208' D is represented as a real-valued vector (character embedding) E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( c ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d where d is the dimensionality of the vector space
p168
aVNot only does this approach improve the efficiency of our model but also it avoids the risk of overfitting
p169
aVExperiment results are reported in Section 4
p170
aVGiven an input sentence c [ 1 n ] , a window of size w slides over the sentence from character c 1 to c n
p171
aVThe most common tagging approach is the window approach
p172
aVThe first row lists three characters we are interested in
p173
aVThe performance is not boosted and the training time increases drastically when the number of factors is larger than 10
p174
aVTake phrase u'\u005cu201c' ÊâìÁØÆÁêÉ(play basketball) u'\u005cu201d' as an example, assuming we are labeling character C 0 = u'\u005cu201c' ÁØÆ u'\u005cu201d' , possible features could be
p175
aVBy minimizing this object, the score of the correct tag sequence y i is increased and score of the highest scoring incorrect tag sequence y ^ is decreased
p176
aVSecond, the non-linear transformation is used to discover higher level representation
p177
aVwhere f u'\u005cu0398' ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] , t i - 1 ) is the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters u'\u005cu0398'
p178
aVIn fact, equation (2) used in previous work is a special case of equation (8) when V is set to 0
p179
aVWe also validated on the number of factors for tensor factorization
p180
aV[ 6 ] developed the SENNA system that approaches or surpasses the state-of-the-art systems on a variety of sequence labeling tasks for English
p181
aVFor evaluation, we use the standard bake-off scoring program to calculate precision, recall, F1-score and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word recall
p182
aVThe embedding matrix M is initialized with small random numbers and trained by back-propagation
p183
aVSimilar to LSA, a low rank approximation of the tensor is derived using a tensor decomposition approch
p184
aVIntuitively, we can interpret each slice of the tensor as capturing a specific type of tag-character interaction and character-character interaction
p185
aV[ 23 ] exploited tensor-based function in the task of Sentiment Analysis to capture more semantic information from constituents
p186
aVGiven the advantage of tensors, we apply a tensor-based transformation to the input vector
p187
aVWe use this tag set in our method
p188
aVWe hypothesize that larger factor size results in too many parameters to train and hence perform worse
p189
aVwhere f u'\u005cu0398' ( t i c [ i - 2 i + 2 ] ) indicates the score output for tag t i at the i -th character by the network with parameters u'\u005cu0398' = ( M , A , W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2
p190
aVFor a given training instance ( x i , y i ) , we search for the tag sequence with the highest score
p191
aVGenerally, the number of hidden units has a limited impact on the performance as long as it is large enough
p192
aVThen a is fed into the next layer which performs linear transformation followed by an element-wise activation function g such as tanh , which is used in our experiments
p193
aVThe output of a tensor product is a vector z u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 2 where each dimension z i is the result of the bilinear form defined by each tensor slice V [ i ] u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' H 1 ◊ H 1

p197
aVSection 5 reviews the related work
p198
aVThe object of Max-Margin training is that the highest scoring tag sequence is the correct one y * = y i and its score will be larger up to a margin to other possible tag sequences y ^ u'\u005cu2208' Y u'\u005cu2062' ( x i )
p199
aVThat u'\u005cu2019' s why we propose to decrease computational cost and avoid overfitting with tensor factorization
p200
aVWe use Y u'\u005cu2062' ( x i ) to denote the set of all possible tag sequences for a given sentence x i and the correct tag sequence for x i is y i
p201
aVIntuitively, the Max-Margin criterion provides an alternative to probabilistic, likelihood-based estimation methods by concentrating directly on the robustness of the decision boundary of a model [ 27 ]
p202
aVUnlike English and other western languages, Chinese do not delimit words by white-space
p203
aVThe parameters of our model are u'\u005cu0398' = { W 1 , b 1 , W 2 , b 2 , M , L , P [ 1
p204
aVFormally, we use a 3-way tensor V [ 1
p205
aVThen the tag embedding E u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' b u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' d u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d for tag t u'\u005cu2208' T with index k can be retrieved by the lookup operation
p206
aVT a similar linear transformation is performed except that no non-linear function is followed
p207
aV[ 17 ] show that pre-trained embeddings can capture interesting semantic and syntactic information such as k u'\u005cu2062' i u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' g - m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n + w u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2248' q u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' n on English data

aVSubstituting equation (9) into equation (8), we get the factorized tensor function
p209
aVWe first define a structured margin loss u'\u005cu25b3' ( y i , y ^ ) for predicting a tag sequence y ^ for a given correct tag sequence y i
p210
aVThe minibatch size is set to 20
p211
aVThe characters exceeding the sentence boundaries are mapped to one of two special symbols, namely u'\u005cu201c' start u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' end u'\u005cu201d' symbols
