<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Topic detection involves detecting the occurrence of a new event such as a plane crash, a murder, a jury trial result, or a political scandal in a stream of news stories from multiple sources and tracking is the process of monitoring a stream of news stories to find those that track (or discuss) the same event</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Toward this objective we make the following contributions a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate the performance of the algorithms on various datasets using different suitable approaches along with a detailed error analysis</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is done on shorter timescales (hours, days), whereas our study focuses on larger timescales (decades, centuries) and we are interested in common nouns, verbs and adjectives as opposed to events that are characterized mostly by named entities</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In summary, the aligner tool takes as input the CW cluster and returns a WordNet synset id that corresponds to the cluster words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this approach, we first extract each word and a set of its context features, which are formed by labeled and directed dependency parse edges as provided in the dataset</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The CW cluster is then aligned to WordNet synsets by comparing the clusters with WordNet graph and the synset with the maximum alignment score is returned as the output</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, this method is limited as it only considers two time points to identify sense changes as opposed to our approach which is over a much larger timescale, thereby, effectively allowing us to track the points of change and the underlying causes</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An element of the table shows the number of candidate words obtained by comparing the corresponding source and target time periods</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u2018' birth cluster u'\u2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense</a>
