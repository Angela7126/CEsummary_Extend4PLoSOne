<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Instead of designing this representation manually, however, we create compact monolingual feature representations for source and target languages separately and automatically estimate the mapping between the two from parallel data</a>
