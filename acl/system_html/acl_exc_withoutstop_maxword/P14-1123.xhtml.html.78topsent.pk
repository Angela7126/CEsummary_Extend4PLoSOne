VBased on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned scores of proficiency level
p1
aVThe result is a new measure based on POS bigrams to assess ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' mastery of syntactic complexity
p2
aVThe idea that the level of syntactic complexity (in terms of its range and sophistication) can be assessed based on the distribution of POS-tags is informed by prior studies in second language acquisition
p3
aVThe syntactic complexity of a test spoken response was estimated based on its similarity to the proficiency groups in the reference corpus with respect to the score-specific constructions
p4
aVThe effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency
p5
aVA criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with
p6
