VFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p1
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p2
aVWe chose the default feature set of the NiuTrans.Phrase engine for building the baseline, including phrase translation probabilities, lexical weights, a 5-gram language model, word and phrase bonuses, a ME-based lexicalized reordering model
p3
aVFor our skeletal language model, we trained a 5-gram language model on the target-side of the bilingual data by generalizing non-skeleton segments to Xs
p4
aVCurrent Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches model the translation problem as a process of generating a derivation of atomic translation units, assuming that every unit is drawn out of the same model
p5
aVHowever, using different skeleton identification results for training and inference (row 3) does not show big improvements due to the data inconsistency problem
p6
aVHowever, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the skeleton of the input tree/sentence or other not-so-important sub-structures
p7
aVIn contrast, we define sentence skeleton as the key segments of a sentence and develop a new MT approach based on this information
p8
aVThen we define skeleton-based translation as a task of searching for the best target string t ^ given the source string and its skeleton u'\u005cu03a4'
p9
aVObviously the skeleton used in this work can be viewed as a simplified sentence
p10
aVAs is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) is used to assign a model score to each derivation
p11
aVThus the problem is in principle the same as sentence simplification/compression
p12
aVA derivation d is skeleton-consistent if no phrases in d cross skeleton boundaries (e.g.,, a phrase where two of the source words are in the skeleton and one is outside
p13
aVFor comparison, we also manually annotated the MT development and test data with skeleton information according to the annotation standard provided within NEUCSS
p14
aVE.g., one may introduce syntactic features into g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) due to their good ability in capturing structural information; and employ a standard phrase-based model for g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) in which not all segments of the sentence need to respect syntactic constraints
p15
aVThere are some previous studies on the use of sentence skeleton or related information in MT [ Mellebeek et al.2006a , Mellebeek et al.2006b , Owczarzak et al.2006 ]
p16
aVThe simplest of these is the phrase-based approach [ Och et al.1999 , Koehn et al.2003 ] which employs a global model to process any sub-strings of the input sentence
p17
aVWe used the NEU Chinese sentence simplification (NEUCSS) corpus as our training data [ Zhang et al.2013 ]
p18
aVThese results indicate that the real improvements are due to the skeleton-based model/features used in this work, rather than the u'\u005cu201d' well-formed u'\u005cu201d' derivations
p19
aVSeen from row s-feat., this feature does not show promising improvements
p20
aVDue to the lack of space, we do not go deep into this problem
p21
aVHere we choose a simple and straightforward method a skeleton is obtained by dropping all unimportant words in the original sentence, while preserving the grammaticality
p22
aVFurther, we regarded skeleton-consistent derivations as an indicator feature and introduced it into the baseline system
p23
aVThen, we can simply define g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) as the model scores of d u'\u005cu03a4' and d
p24
aVThe motivations of defining the problem in this way are two-fold
p25
aVwhere the skeleton translation model handles the translation of the sentence skeleton, while the full translation model is the baseline model and handles the original problem of translating the whole sentence

p30
aVWe used the newswire portion of the NIST MT06 evaluation data as our development set, and used the evaluation data of MT04 and MT05 as our test sets
p31
aVFor language modeling, l u'\u005cu2062' m is the standard n -gram language model adopted in the baseline system l u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu03a4' is a skeletal language for estimating the well-formedness of the translation skeleton
p32
aVTo investigate it, we removed the skeletal language model from our skeleton-based translation system (with automatic skeleton identification on both the development and test sets
p33
aVThe skeleton translation model focuses on the translation of the sentence skeleton, i.e.,, the solid (red) rectangles; while the full translation model computes the model score for all those phrase-pairs, i.e.,, all solid and dashed rectangles
p34
aVWe develop a skeleton-based model which divides translation into two sub-models a skeleton translation model (i.e.,, translating the key elements) and a full translation model (i.e.,, translating the remaining source words and generating the complete translation
p35
aVIn this paper we instead explicitly model the translation problem with sentence skeleton information
p36
aVWe develop a skeletal language model to describe the possibility of translation skeleton and handle some of the long-distance word dependencies
p37
aVTo learn the skeletal language model, we replace non-skeleton parts of the target sentences in the bilingual corpus to Xs using the source sentence skeletons and word alignments
p38
aVRow s-space of Table 1 shows the BLEU and TER results of restricting the baseline system to the space of skeleton-consistent derivations, i.e.,, we remove both the skeleton-based translation model and language model from the SBMT system
p39
aVGiven a translation model m , a language model l u'\u005cu2062' m and a vector of feature weights u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' , the model score of a derivation d is computed by
p40
aVThe skeletal language model is then trained on these generalized strings in a standard way of n -gram language modeling
p41
aVIn spite of their good ideas of using skeleton skeleton information, they did not model the skeleton-based translation problem in modern SMT pipelines
p42
aVGiven a baseline phrase-based system, all we need is to learn the feature weights u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' u'\u005cu03a4' on the development set (with source-language skeleton annotation) and the skeletal language model l u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu03a4' on the target-language side of the bilingual corpus
p43
aVFigure 1 shows the translation process and associated model scores for the example sentence
p44
aVSome of them developed syntax-based models on complete syntactic trees with Treebank annotations [ Liu et al.2006 , Huang et al.2006 , Zhang et al.2008 ] , and others used source-language syntax as soft constraints [ Marton and Resnik2008 , Chiang2010 ]
p45
aVThe motivation here is straightforward we use an additional score g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) to model the problem of skeleton translation and interpolate it with the baseline model
p46
aVIn this work both the skeleton translation model g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and full translation model g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) resemble the usual forms used in phrase-based MT, i.e.,, the model score is computed by a linear combination of a group of phrase-based features and language models
p47
aVHere a translation skeleton is a target string where all segments of non-skeleton translation are generalized to a symbol X
p48
aVIn this way the reordering problems in skeleton translation and full translation are distinguished and handled separately
p49
aVFor comparison, we removed the skeleton-based translation model from our system as well
p50
aV7 ), we can perform standard decoding while u'\u005cu201d' doubly weighting u'\u005cu201d' the phrases which cover a skeletal section of the sentence, and combining the two language models and the translation model in a linear fashion
p51
aVIn such a way of string representation, the skeletal language model can be implemented as a standard n -gram language model, that is, a string probability is calculated by a product of a sequence of n -gram probabilities (involving normal words and X
p52
aVSentence Skeleton (subscripts represent indices
p53
aVThis language model was used in both the baseline and our improved systems
p54
aVA 5-gram language model was trained on the Xinhua portion of the English Gigaword corpus in addition to the target-side of the bilingual data
p55
aVWe start with an assumption that the 1-best skeleton is provided by the skeleton identification system
p56
aVIt indicates that this language model is very beneficial to our system
p57
aVAnother interesting question is whether the skeletal language model really contributes to the improvements
p58
aVOur work is a further step towards the use of sentence skeleton in MT
p59
aVSeen from row - l u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu03a4' of Table 1 , the removal of the skeletal language model results in a significant drop in both BLEU and TER performance
p60
aVObviously, from any skeleton-consistent derivation d we can extract a skeleton derivation d u'\u005cu03a4' which covers the sentence skeleton exactly
p61
aVE.g., in Figure 1 , the translation skeleton is u'\u005cu2019' the cost X has been further reduced X u'\u005cu2019' , where two Xs represent non-skeleton segments in the translation
p62
aVNext we describe our approach to integrating skeleton information into MT models
p63
aVOur skeleton identification system was built using the t3 toolkit 2 2 http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/T.Cohn/t3/ which implements a state-of-the-art sentence simplification system
p64
aVIn phrase-based MT, the translation problem is modeled by a derivation of phrase-pairs
p65
aVIn Section 3.1 we describe the corpus and system employed for automatic generation of sentence skeletons
p66
aVRow - m u'\u005cu03a4' of Table 1 shows that the skeleton-based translation model can contribute to the overall improvement but there is no big differences between baseline and - m u'\u005cu03a4'
p67
aVSee the following for an example skeleton of a Chinese sentence
p68
aVOur bilingual corpus consists of 2.7M sentence pairs
p69
aVFor example, an important-first strategy is generally adopted in human translation - we translate the key elements/structures (or skeleton) of the sentence first, and then translate the remaining parts
p70
aVIn both the manual and automatic identification of sentence skeleton (rows 2 and 4), there is a significant improvement on the u'\u005cu201d' All u'\u005cu201d' data set
p71
aVTo compute g u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) , we use a linear combination of a skeleton translation model g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and a full translation model g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d )
p72
aVThe first issue that arises is how to identify the skeleton for a given source sentence
p73
aVWe apply the proposed model to Chinese-English phrase-based MT and demonstrate promising BLEU improvements and TER reductions on the NIST evaluation data
p74
aVAnother note on the model
p75
aVSee Figure 1 for an example of applying the above model to phrase-based MT
p76
aVWe experimented with our approach on Chinese-English translation using the NiuTrans open-source MT toolkit [ Xiao et al.2012 ]
p77
aVBoth g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) share the same translation model m which can easily learned from the bilingual data 1 1 In g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) , we compute the reordering model score on the skeleton though it is learned from the full sentences
p78
aVApart from showing the effects of the skeleton-based model, we also studied the behavior of the MT system under the different settings of search space
p79
aVIt contains the annotation of sentence skeleton on the Chinese-language side of the Penn Parallel Chinese-English Treebank (LDC2003E07
p80
aVThe above problem can be redefined in a Viterbi fashion - we find the derivation d ^ with the highest model score given s and u'\u005cu03a4'
p81
aVIn the figure, each source phrase is translated into a target phrase, which is represented by linked rectangles
p82
aVWe trained our system using the Parts 1-8 of the NEUCSS corpus and obtained a 65.2% relational F1 score and 63.1% compression rate in held-out test (Part 10
p83
aVOriginal Sentence (subscripts represent indices
p84
aVMore importantly, we develop a complete approach to this issue and show its effectiveness in a state-of-the-art MT system
p85
aVNote that the source-language structural information has been intensively investigated in recent studies of syntactic translation models
p86
aVSkeleton is a concept that has been used in several sub-areas in MT for years
p87
aVNote that this method does not require any new translation models for implementation
p88
aVFor example, in confusion network-based system combination it refers to the backbone hypothesis for building confusion networks [ Rosti et al.2007 , Rosti et al.2008 ] ; Liu et al.2011 regard skeleton as a shortened sentence after removing some of the function words for better word deletion

aVMany good sentence simpliciation/compression methods are available to our work
p98
aVAll these sentences were aligned in word level using the GIZA++ system and the u'\u005cu201d' grow-diag-final-and u'\u005cu201d' heuristics

aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1f' m u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) is a vector of feature values defined on d , and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' m is the corresponding weight vector l u'\u005cu2062' m u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and w l u'\u005cu2062' m are the score and weight of the language model, respectively

aV3 ) provides a very flexible way for model selection
p101
aVLet d s , u'\u005cu03a4' , t (or d for short) denote a translation derivation
p102
aVIn this way, all we need is to increasingly translate a sequence of source words each time until the entire sentence is covered
p103
aVTable 1 shows the case-insensitive IBM-version BLEU and TER scores of different systems
p104
aVFor example, in Figure 1 , the derivation of phrase-pairs { p 1 , p 2 , u'\u005cu2026' , p 9 } is skeleton-consistent, and the skeleton derivation is formed by { p 1 , p 4 , p 5 , p 9 }

aVTo ease modeling, we only consider skeleton-consistent derivations in this work

aVOn the other hand, it has different feature weight vectors for individual models (i.e.,, u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' u'\u005cu03a4'

aVBy substituting Eq

aVE.g., we can start with a full syntactic tree and transform it into a simpler form (e.g.,, removing a sub-tree

aVIn this way, the MT output can be regarded as the target-string encoded in d ^
p115
aVWhile we will restrict ourself to phrase-based translation in the following description and experiments, we can choose different models/features for g s u'\u005cu2062' k u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d ) and g f u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' l u'\u005cu2062' ( d
