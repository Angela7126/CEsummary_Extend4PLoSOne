VHowever, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables

aVComparison with Reranking As column 6 of Table 2 shows, our model outperforms the reranker by 1.3% 5 5 Note that the comparison is conservative because we can also add MST scores as features in our model as in reranker
