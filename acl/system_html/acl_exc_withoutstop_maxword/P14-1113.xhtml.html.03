<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, there usually also exists hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations among these hypernyms</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We extract hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations in the Baidubaike corpus, which is also used to train word embeddings (Section 4.1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this paper, we aim to identify hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations using word embeddings, which have been shown to preserve good properties for capturing semantic relationship between words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>That is, all word pairs ( x , y ) in the training data are first clustered into several groups, where word pairs in each group are expected to exhibit similar hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We obtain 15,247 word pairs of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (9,288 for direct relations and 5,959 for indirect relations</a>
