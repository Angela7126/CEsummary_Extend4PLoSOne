VIt shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board

aVIn order to explore the error propagation from the classifiers themselves and explore the upper bound for improvement from the reordering models, we perform an u'\u005cu201c' oracle u'\u005cu201d' study, letting the classifiers be aware of the u'\u005cu201c' gold u'\u005cu201d' reordering type between two syntactic constituents or two semantic roles, and returning a higher probability for the gold reordering type and a smaller one for the others (i.e.,, we set 0.9 for the gold reordering type, and let the other non-gold three types share 0.1
