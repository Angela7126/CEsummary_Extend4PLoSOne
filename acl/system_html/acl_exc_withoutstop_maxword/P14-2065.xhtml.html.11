<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, at least initially, we are focusing on the 6,000+ verbs already cataloged in VerbNet</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Because we recruited large numbers of annotators, most of whom annotated only a few items, typical measures of inter-annotator agreement such as Cohen u'\u2019' s kappa are not easily calculated</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Each task had been iteratively piloted and redesigned until inter-annotator reliability was acceptable, as described in a previous publication</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet</a>
