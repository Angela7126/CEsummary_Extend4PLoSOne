<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The structured perceptron algorithm [ Collins2002 ] learns an optimal weight vector w by updating w on input x ( i ) by the following rule, in case the predicted translation y ^ is different from and scored higher than the reference translation y ( i )</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We show in an error analysis that this improvement can be attributed to using structural and lexical variants of reference translations as positive examples in response-based learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Upon predicting translation y ^ , in case of positive feedback from the task, we treat the prediction as surrogate reference by setting y + u'\u2190' y ^ , and by adding it to the set of reference translations for future use</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In case of negative feedback, a structural update can be performed against translations that have been approved previously by positive task feedback</a>
