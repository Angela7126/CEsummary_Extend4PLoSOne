VOur method extracts event causality based on three assumptions that are embodied as features of our classifier
p1
aVNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method
p2
aVFor the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u005cu27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u005cu27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1
p3
aVWe require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted
p4
aVBase features represent the basic properties of event causality like nouns, templates, and their excitation polarities (See Section LABEL:A-sec:base-features in the supplementary notes
