<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Accuracy is defined as the number of correct responses over the number of instances</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Model performance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy using Equation ( 2 ) as the scoring function</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The comparison is unavailable in SemEval2007 since we have not found existing experiments with this exact configuration</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Overlap was assessed by string matching, with the number of matching words squared so as to assign higher scores to multi-word overlaps</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because it is a rare event for the NBM to produce identical scores, 4 4 This has never occurred in the hundreds of thousands of runs in our development process the model always proposes a unique answer and accuracy is thus equivalent to F-score commonly used in existing reports</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>More recently, proposed a tree-matching algorithm that measured gloss-context overlap as the weighted sum of dependency-induced lexical distance</a>
