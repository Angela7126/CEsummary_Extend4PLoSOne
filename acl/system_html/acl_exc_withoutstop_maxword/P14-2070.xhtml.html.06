<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The quest for a high precision and high coverage lexicon, where words are associated with either sentiment or emotion scores, has several reasons</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this work, we aim at automatically producing a high coverage and high precision emotion lexicon using distributional semantics, with numerical scores associated with each emotion, like it has already been done for sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In recent years there has been an increasing focus on producing lists of words (lexica) with prior polarities, to be used in sentiment analysis</a>
