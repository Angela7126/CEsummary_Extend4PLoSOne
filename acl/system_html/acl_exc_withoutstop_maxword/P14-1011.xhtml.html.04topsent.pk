VIn our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs
p1
aVAs the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction
p2
aVGiven a phrase pair ( s , t ) , the BRAE model first obtains their semantic phrase representations ( p s , p t ) , and then transforms p s into target semantic space p s * , p t into source semantic space p t *
p3
aVIdeally, we want the learned BRAE model can make sure that the semantic error for the positive example (a source phrase s and its correct translation t ) is much smaller than that for the negative example (the source phrase s and a bad translation t u'\u005cu2032'
