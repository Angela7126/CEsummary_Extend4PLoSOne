(lp0
VFor each word w , we first prune out its POS candidates by using the vocabulary from the training set
p1
aVHowever, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables
p2
aVWhen proposing a small move, i.e.,, sampling a head of the word, we can also jointly sample its POS tag from a set of alternatives provided by the tagger
p3
aVJoint Parsing and POS Correction Table 3 shows the results of joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset, for our model and state-of-the-art systems
p4
aVBecause the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees
p5
aVThe reranker uses the same features as our model, along with the tree scores obtained from the MST parser (which is a standard practice in reranking
p6
aVReranking can be combined with an arbitrary scoring function, and thus can easily incorporate global features over the entire parse tree
p7
aVwhere y corresponds to a tree with a spcified root and w i u'\u005cu2062' j is the exponential of the first-order score y is always a valid parse tree if we allow multiple children of the root and do not impose projective constraint
p8
aVWe generate the POS candidate list for each word based on the confusion matrix on the training set
p9
aVSince our features do not by design correspond to a first-order parser, we cannot use the Wilson algorithm as it is
p10
aVThey first appeared in the context of reranking [ 6 ] , where a simple parser is used to generate a candidate list which is then reranked according to the scoring function
p11
aVThe reranker operates over the top-50 list obtained from the MST parser 4 4 The MST parser is trained in projective mode for reranking because generating top-k list from second-order non-projective model is intractable
p12
aVBecause the CoNLL datasets do not have a standard development set, we randomly select a held out of 200 sentences from the training set
p13
aVWe find a high scoring tree through sampling, and (later) learn the parameters u'\u005cu0398' so as to further guide this process
p14
aVIn our case, we choose a word j randomly, and then sample its head h j according to p with the constraint that we obtain a valid tree (when projective trees are sought, this constraint is also incorporated
p15
aVComparison with Reranking As column 6 of Table 2 shows, our model outperforms the reranker by 1.3% 5 5 Note that the comparison is conservative because we can also add MST scores as features in our model as in reranker
p16
aVMoreover, alternatives that are far from the gold parse should score even lower
p17
aVThis is feasible if we restrict the proposed moves to only small changes in the current tree
p18
aVBecause the inference procedure is so simple, it is important that the parameters of the scoring function are chosen in a manner that facilitates how we climb the scoring function in small steps
p19
aVDependency parsing is commonly cast as a maximization problem over a parameterized scoring function
p20
aVTherefore, we add different features to capture POS tag and span length consistency in a coordinate structure
p21
aVDecoding Speed Our sampling-based parser is an anytime algorithm, and therefore its running time can be traded for performance
p22
aVFor this choice of q , the probability of accepting the new tree ( u'\u005cu0391' in Figure 1 ) is identically one
p23
aVOn the CATiB dataset, we restrict the sample trees to always be projective as described in Section 3.2.1
p24
aVNext, we add global features that are not used by the Turbo parser
p25
aVWe repeatedly generate parses based on the current parameters u'\u005cu0398' t for each sentence x ( i ) , and use successive samples to enforce constraints in Equation 4 and Equation 5 one at a time
p26
aVIf the walk hits the current tree, the walk path is added to form a new tree with more nodes
p27
aVWe split the sentence based on the ending punctuation, predict the parse tree for each segment and group the roots of resulting trees into a single node
p28
aVTherefore, the first-order distribution is not well-defined and we only employ Gibbs sampling for simplicity
p29
aVInstead we use it as the proposal function and sample a subset of the dependencies from the first-order distribution of our model, while fixing the others
p30
aVWe also define features based on consecutive sibling, grandparent, arbitrary sibling, head bigram, grand-sibling and tri-siblings, which are also used in the Turbo parser [ 16 ]
p31
aVOur sampler generates a sequence of dependency structures so as to approximate independent samples from
p32
aVAs column 7 shows, this increase in the list size does not change the relative performance of the reranker and our model
p33
aVSpecifically, we measure the score of the retrieved trees in testing as a function of the decoding speed, measured by the number of tokens per second
p34
aVThe algorithm in Wilson ( 1996 ) iterates over all the nodes, and for each node performs a random walk according to the weights w i u'\u005cu2062' j until the walk creates a loop or hits a tree
p35
aVImpact of Sampling Methods We compare two sampling methods introduced in Section 3.2 with respect to their decoding efficiency
p36
aVAs a result, the selected tag is influenced by a broad syntactic context above and beyond the initial tagging model and is directly optimized to improve parsing performance
p37
aVAs the upper part of the table shows, the parser with corrected tags reaches 88.38% compared to the accuracy of 88.46% on the gold tags
p38
aVWhile in general this is increasingly difficult with more heads, it is indeed tractable if the model corresponds to a first-order parser
p39
aVHowever, we do not impose this constraint for the CoNLL datasets
p40
aV6 6 We ran this experiment on 5 languages with small datasets due to the scalability issues associated with reranking top-500 list
p41
aVThis suggests that our learning and inference procedures are as effective as the dual decomposition method in the Turbo parser
p42
aVWe report UAS excluding punctuation on CoNLL datasets, following Martins et al
p43
aVBecause the steps are small, the complexity of the scoring function has limited impact on the computational cost of the procedure
p44
aVA training set of size N is given as a set of pairs u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' = { ( x ( i ) , y ( i ) ) } i = 1 N where y ( i ) is the ground truth parse for sentence x ( i )
p45
aVIn this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt the method for parsing with rich scoring functions
p46
aVIn this view, the use of more expressive scoring functions leads to more challenging combinatorial problems of finding the maximizing parse
p47
aVGenerally, this feature can be defined based on an instance of grandparent structure
p48
aVWe select these two languages as they correspond to two extremes in sentence length
p49
aVAssuming that the predicted tag for w is t p , we further remove those tags t if their counts are smaller than some threshold c u'\u005cu2062' ( t , t p ) u'\u005cu0391' u'\u005cu22c5' c u'\u005cu2062' ( t p , t p ) 2 2 In our work we choose u'\u005cu0391' = 0.003 , which gives a 98.9% oracle POS tagging accuracy on the CATiB development set
p50
aVNon-projective Arcs A flag indicating if a dependency is projective or not (i.e., if it spans a word that does not descend from its head) [ 17 ]
p51
aVSpecifically, if the current parameters are u'\u005cu0398' t , and we enforce constraint Equation 5 for a particular pair y , y u'\u005cu2032' , then we will find u'\u005cu0398' t + 1 that minimizes
p52
aVThus, we can complement the constraints in Equation 4 with additional pairwise constraints [ 32 ]
p53
aVIn SampleRank, the parameters are adjusted so as to guide the sequence of candidates closer to the target structure along the search path
p54
aVFor instance, Nakagawa ( 2007 ) deals with tractability issues by using sampling to approximate marginals
p55
aVThe temperature parameter T controls how concentrated the samples are around the maximum of s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) (e.g.,, see Geman and Geman ( 1984 )
p56
aVOur method provides a more effective mechanism for handling global features than reranking, outperforming it by 1.3%
p57
aVNote that blocked Gibbs sampling would be exponential in K , and is thus very slow already at K = 4
p58
aVHowever, we are free to add higher order features because we do not rely on dynamic programming decoding
p59
aVEvaluation Measures Following standard practice, we use Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) as the evaluation metric in all our experiments
p60
aVThus new moves are always accepted
p61
aVWe cannot necessarily assume that s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) is greater than s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y u'\u005cu2032' ) without additional encouragement
p62
aVThe target distribution p folds into the procedure by defining the probability that we will accept the proposed move
p63
aVAs a result, we require that
p64
aVWe don u'\u005cu2019' t prune anything if w is unseen
p65
aVFinally, we extend our model to a joint parsing and POS correction task
p66
aVSimilarly, parsers based on dual decomposition [ 17 , 14 ] assume that s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) decomposes into a sum of terms where each term can be maximized over y efficiently
p67
aVMuch of the recent work on parsing has been focused on improving methods for solving the combinatorial maximization inference problems
p68
aVOur combination outperforms the state-of-the-art parsers and remains comparable even if we adopt their scoring functions
p69
aVWe handle long sentences during testing by applying a simple split-merge strategy
p70
aVWe first compare our model to the Turbo parser using the Turbo parser feature set
p71
aVPOS Tag Features In the joint POS correction scenario, we also add additional features specifically for POS prediction
p72
aVBaselines We compare our model with the Turbo parser and the MST parser
p73
aVWe extend our model such that it jointly learns how to predict a parse tree and also correct the predicted POS tags for a better parsing performance
p74
aVIn this work, we investigate a joint POS correction scenario in which only the predicted POS tags are provided in the testing phase, while both gold and predicted tags are available for the training set
p75
aVThe first-order model is also trained using the algorithm in Figure 4
p76
aVWe apply the Random Walk-based sampling method (see Section 3.2.2 ) for the standard dependency parsing task
p77
aVWe then train the reranker by running 10 epochs of cost-augmented MIRA
p78
aVIn this section, we introduce our novel sampling-based dependency parser which can incorporate arbitrary global features
p79
aVOne such sampling algorithm is the random walk sampler of Wilson ( 1996
p80
aVFor each sampling, let u'\u005cu210b' be the set of candidate heads and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' be the set of candidate POS tags
p81
aVThis approach was suggested in the SampleRank framework [ 32 ] for training structured prediction models
p82
aVFor instance, in cats and dogs , the conjuncts are both short noun phrases
p83
aVAfter tuning, the model is trained on the full training set with the selected parameters
p84
aVThe general structure of our sampling algorithm is given in Figure 1
p85
aVFor instance, we can sample the POS tag, the dependency relation or morphology information
p86
aVThe trees are annotated with both gold and predicted versions of POS tags and morphology information
p87
aVThe Effect of Constraints in Learning Our training method updates parameters to satisfy the pairwise constraints between (1) subsequent samples on the sampling path and (2) selected samples and the ground truth
p88
aVIdeally, we would change multiple heads in the parse tree simultaneously, and sample those choices from the corresponding conditional distribution of p
p89
aVSet y 0 to some random tree
p90
aVFigure 4 summarizes the learning algorithm
p91
aVFor scoring functions that extend beyond first-order arc preferences, finding the maximizing non-projective tree is known to be NP-hard [ 23 ]
p92
aVAs shown in Figure 5 , the arc is the basic structure for first-order features
p93
aVFor instance, a scoring function that operates over each single dependency can be optimized using the maximum spanning tree algorithm [ 21 ]
p94
aV2013 ) , for this dataset we use 12 core POS tags, word lemmas, determiner features, rationality features and functional genders and numbers
p95
aVStarting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse
p96
aVFor both languages, the tree score improves over time
p97
aVWe use all sentences in CoNLL datasets during training and testing
p98
aVIndeed, state-of-the-art results have been obtained by adapting powerful tools from optimization [ 16 , 17 , 27 ]
p99
aVHowever, our sampling procedure generates a small number of structures along the search path
p100
aVThese constraints serve to guide the sampling process derived from the scoring function towards the gold parse
p101
aVIn this case, we combine the scoring function for trees with a stand-alone tagging model
p102
aVFor the Turbo parser, we directly compare with the recent published results in [ 16 ]
p103
aVIt is easy to extend our sampling-based parsing framework to joint prediction of parsing and other labels
p104
aVHere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) is the set of valid (projective or non-projective) dependency trees for sentence x
p105
aVOur first strategy is akin to Gibbs sampling and samples a new head for each word in the sentence, modifying one arc at a time
p106
aVIn each step we uniformly sample K nodes to update and sample their new heads using the Wilson algorithm (in the experiments we use K = 4
p107
aVDatasets We evaluate our model on standard benchmark corpora u'\u005cu2014' CoNLL 2006 and CoNLL 2008 [ 4 , 30 ] u'\u005cu2014' which include dependency treebanks for 14 different languages
p108
aVTable 1 summarizes all POS tag feature templates
p109
aVWith these features our model achieves an average UAS 89.28%
p110
aVIn terms of joint parsing and tagging on the CATiB dataset, we nearly bridge (88.38%) the gap between independently predicted (86.95%) and gold tags (88.45%

aVCATiB mostly includes projective trees
p115
aVWe also compare our model against a discriminative reranker
p116
aVThe first column in Table 2 shows the result for our model with an average of 88.87%, and the third column shows the results for the Turbo parser with an average of 88.72%
p117
aVFor efficiency, we limit the sentence length to 70 tokens in training and development sets
p118
aVSpan Length This feature captures the distribution of the binned span length of each POS tag
p119
aVOur method outperforms the Turbo parser across 14 languages on average by 0.5%
p120
aVFor the MST parser, we train a second-order non-projective model using the most recent version of the code 3 3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mstparser/
p121
aVIn this paper, we introduce a sampling-based parser that places few or no constraints on the scoring function
p122
aVFirst- to Third-Order Features The feature templates of first- to third-order features are mainly drawn from previous work on graph-based parsing [ 23 ] , transition-based parsing [ 25 ] and dual decomposition-based parsing [ 17 ]
p123
aVSpecifically, when sampling the new heads, we can also sample the values of other variables at the same time
p124
aVOne possible explanation of this performance gap between the reranker and our model is the small number of candidates considered by the reranker
p125
aVIt outperforms the Turbo parser by 0.5% and achieves the best reported performance on four languages
p126
aVThis gives a 99% pruning recall on the CATiB development set
p127
aVThe second strategy relies on a provably correct sampler for first-order scores [ 33 ] , and uses it within a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for general scoring functions
p128
aVFor the CATiB dataset, we report UAS including punctuation in order to be consistent with the published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task [ 28 ]
p129
aVComparison with State-of-the-art Parsers Table 2 summarizes the performance of our model and of the baselines
p130
aVFor instance, we can use the framework to correct preprocessing mistakes in features such as part-of-speech (POS) tags
p131
aVMoreover, our model also outperforms the 88.80% average UAS reported in Martins et al
p132
aVWe begin with the notation before addressing the decoding and learning algorithms
p133
aVIn the first case the algorithm erases the loop and continues the walk
p134
aVEarlier works on dependency parsing focused on inference with tractable scoring functions
p135
aVWe follow here a Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm (e.g.,, see Andrieu et al
p136
aVMost of these data sets contain non-projective dependency trees
p137
aVThe parser still managed to process all the datasets in a reasonable time
p138
aVGiven sufficient time, both sampling methods achieve the same score
p139
aVValency We consider valency features for each POS tag
p140
aVThis result is to be expected given that each iteration of this sampler makes multiple changes to the tree, in contrast to a single-edge change of Gibbs sampler
p141
aVNeighbors The POS tags of the neighboring words to the left and right of each span, together with the binned span length and the POS tag at the span root
p142
aVThis is a substantial increase from the parser that uses predicted tags (86.95%
p143
aVThe proposal distribution over the moves is derived from the scoring function itself
p144
aVConstruct tree y u'\u005cu2032' from the head array

aVTo put these numbers into perspective, the bottom part of Table 3 shows the accuracy of the best systems from the 2013 SPMRL shared task on Arabic parsing using predicted information [ 28 ]
p146
aVInputs u'\u005cu0398' , x , T 0 (initial temperature), c (temperature update rate), proposal distribution q
p147
aVThe performance of our model is shown in the second column with an average of 89.23%
p148
aVMoreover, these results demonstrate that comparison between subsequent samples is more important than comparison against the gold tree
p149
aVWe introduce both margin constraints and constraints pertaining to successive samples generated along the search path
p150
aVWe also pick the training epochs from { 50 , 100 , 150 } which gives the best performance on the development set for each language
p151
aVThe distribution q governs the small steps that are taken in generating a sequence of structures
p152
aVOur system not only outperforms the best single system [ 2 ] by 1.4%, but it also tops the ensemble system that combines three powerful parsers the Mate parser [ 3 ] , the Easy-First parser [ 10 ] and the Turbo parser [ 16 ]
p153
aVWe use a 10-fold cross-validation to generate candidate lists for training
p154
aVThe decoding problem consists of finding a valid dependency tree y u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x ) that maximizes the score s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) = u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu22c5' f u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) with parameters u'\u005cu0398'
p155
aVWe begin with the standard margin constraints
p156
aVSome CATiB sentences exceed 200 tokens
p157
aVThe parameters are learned in an on-line fashion by successively imposing soft constraints between pairs of dependency structures
p158
aVPerhaps the most natural choice of the proposal distribution q is a conditional distribution from p
p159
aVWe only enforce the above constraints for y , y u'\u005cu2032' that are consecutive samples in the course of the sampling process
p160
aVOur work builds on one such approach u'\u005cu2014' SampleRank [ 32 ] , a sampling-based learning algorithm
p161
aVOutputs
p162
aVWe dispense with the notion of a candidate set and seek to exploit the scoring function more directly
p163
aVThe procedure is described in Figure 2 with a graphic illustration in Figure 3
p164
aVThe Gibbs sampler will generate a new sample from the space u'\u005cu210b' × u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf'
p165
aVIn this section, we describe how to learn the adjustable parameters u'\u005cu0398' in the scoring function
p166
aVThis flag is also combined with the POS tags or the lexical words of the head and the modifier
p167
aVThis is meant to test how our learning and inference methods compare to a dual decomposition approach
p168
aVSampling from target distribution p is typically as hard as (or harder than) that maximizing s u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y
p169
aVThis is repeated until all the nodes are included in the tree
p170
aVThe feature templates are inspired by previous feature-rich POS tagging work [ 31 ]
p171
aVThis is better than the best published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task [ 28 ] , including parser ensembles
p172
aVHowever, the Random Walk-based sampler performs better when the quality is traded for speed
p173
aVThis usually leads to slow mixing, requiring more samples to get close to the parse with maximum score
p174
aVThe benefits of sampling-based learning go beyond stand-alone parsing
p175
aVFor each word x i , we prune away the incoming dependencies u'\u005cu27e8' h i , x i u'\u005cu27e9' with probability less than 0.005 times the probability of the most likely head, and limit the number of candidate heads up to 30
p176
aVOther approaches operate over full trees and generate a sequence of candidates that successively increase the score [ 8 , 15 , 32 ]
p177
aVIndeed, the set may already omit the gold parse
p178
aVFor instance, a transition-based parsing system [ 36 ] incrementally constructs a parsing structure using greedy beam-search
p179
aVWe change the temperature update rate c in order to decode with different speed
p180
aVNote that Equation 4 contains exponentially many constraints and cannot be enforced jointly for general scoring functions
p181
aVInputs x , y t , u'\u005cu0398' , K (number of heads to change
p182
aVFor example, in the second-order MST parser [ 23 ] , all the feature terms involve arcs or consecutive siblings
p183
aVCoordination In a coordinate structure, the two adjacent conjuncts usually agree with each other on POS tags and their span lengths
p184
aVOur joint parsing-tagging model provides an alternative to the widely-adopted pipeline setup
p185
aVThe power of this methodology is nevertheless limited by the initial set of alternatives from the simpler parser
p186
aVOne shortcoming of the Gibbs sampler is that it only changes one variable (arc) at a time
p187
aVOutputs y *
p188
aVAn ideal scoring function would always rank the gold parse higher than any alternative
p189
aVIn the experiments reported above, we chose a conservative cooling rate and continued to sample until the score no longer changed
p190
aVRight Branch This feature enables the model to prefer right or left-branching trees
p191
aVGlobal Features We used feature shown promising in prior reranking work Charniak and Johnson ( 2005 ) , Collins ( 2000 ) and Huang ( 2008 )
p192
aVWe also use the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) [ 20 ]
p193
aVIt counts the number of words on the path from the root node to the right-most non-punctuation word, normalized by the length of the sentence
p194
aVThis method was originally developed for a sequence labeling task with local features, and was shown to be more effective than state-of-the-art alternatives
p195
aVThe second type of constraints are enforced between successive samples along the search path
p196
aVIt can be shown that this procedure generates i.i.d trees from p u'\u005cu2062' ( y )
p197
aVAfter pruning, we tune the regularization parameter C = { 0.1 , 0.01 , 0.001 } on development sets for different languages
p198
aVAfter generating the candidate lists for each word, the rest of the extension is rather straightforward
p199
aVFigure 6 shows an example
p200
aVWe denote sentences by x and the corresponding dependency trees by y u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb4' u'\u005cu2062' ( x
p201
aVIn Figure 9 we show the corresponding curves for two languages
p202
aVWe enforce only constraints corresponding to those samples
p203
aVHere we apply SampleRank to parsing, applying several modifications such as the proposal distributions mentioned earlier
p204
aVTo test this hypothesis, we performed experiments with top-500 list for a subset of languages
p205
aVwhere f u'\u005cu2062' ( x , y ) is the feature vector associated with tree y for sentence x
p206
aVFigure 10 shows that applying both types of constraints is consistently better than using either of them alone
p207
aVExperimental Details Following Koo and Collins ( 2010 ) , we always first train a first-order pruner
p208
aVHowever, we do not impose this constraint during testing
p209
aVWe evaluate our method on benchmark multilingual dependency corpora
p210
aVWe explore two alternative proposal distributions
p211
aVOutputs y u'\u005cu2032'
p212
aVFor example, the time that it took to decode all the test sentences in Chinese and Arabic were 3min and 15min, respectively
p213
aVArabic has the longest sentences on average, while Chinese has the shortest ones
p214
aVWe learn the parameters u'\u005cu0398' in an on-line fashion to satisfy the above constraints
p215
aVSpecifically, we add two types of valency information
p216
aVArabic and Chinese
p217
aVThe other parts of the algorithm remain the same
p218
aVIt can be used to obtain i.i.d samples from distributions of the form
p219
aVA natural approach to approximate global inference is via search
p220
aVPP Attachment We add features of lexical tuples involving the head, the argument and the preposition of prepositional phrases

aVOn four languages, we top the best published results

aVIn addition to these first- to third-order structures, we also consider grand-grandparent and sibling-grandchild structures
p240
aVRecent work has focused on more powerful inference mechanisms that consider the full search space [ 34 , 27 , 14 , 12 ]
p241
aVIts main disadvantage is that the output parse can only be one of the few parses passed to the reranker

p243
aVOne way to achieve this is to make sure that improvements in the scoring functions are correlated with improvements in the quality of the parse
p244
aVThere are two types of sibling-grandchild structures
p245
aVOur current implementation is in Java and can be further optimized for speed
p246
aVIt also includes flags of whether the span reaches the end of the sentence and whether the span is followed by the punctuation
p247
aVIn our work we use feature templates up to 5-gram
p248
aVThe key ingredient in our approach is how learning is coupled with inference
p249
aVTo illustrate the idea, consider a parse y that differs from y ( i ) in only one arc, and a parse y u'\u005cu2032' that differs from y ( i ) in ten arcs
p250
aVWe use x j to refer to the j th word of sentence x , and h j to the head word of x j
p251
aVLet c u'\u005cu2062' ( t g , t p ) be the count when the gold tag is t g and the predicted one is t p
p252
aVWe depart from this view and instead focus on using highly expressive scoring functions with substantially simpler inference procedures
p253
aVHowever, we also handle the case of coordination
p254
aVWe do not make any assumptions about how the feature function decomposes
p255
aVwhere similarly to Equation 4 , the difference in scores scales with the differences in errors with respect to the target y ( i
p256
aVThe updates can be calculated in closed form
p257
aVThe method has been successfully used in sequence labeling and machine translation [ 11 ]

aV1) inner-sibling when the sibling is between the head and the modifier and (2) outer-sibling for the other cases
p260
aVThe idea in DD is to decompose the hard maximization problem into smaller parts that can be efficiently maximized and enforce agreement among these via Lagrange multipliers
p261
aVIt turns out that the latter optimizes the score more efficiently than the former
p262
aVAnother example is the dual decomposition (DD) framework [ 14 , 17 ]
p263
aVIn this case, the arguments should be the conjuncts rather than the coordinator
