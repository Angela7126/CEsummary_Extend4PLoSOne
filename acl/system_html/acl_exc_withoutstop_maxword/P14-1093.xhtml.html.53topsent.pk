VNote that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u005cu2019' s method
p1
aVOur scenario generation method generates scenarios by chaining extracted event causality; generating A u'\u005cu2192' B u'\u005cu2192' C from A u'\u005cu2192' B and B u'\u005cu2192' C
p2
aVWe believe that contexts exist where event causality candidates are more likely to appear, as described in Section 1
p3
aVCEA u u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' s is an unsupervised method that uses CEA to rank event causality candidates, and CEA s u'\u005cu2062' u u'\u005cu2062' p is a supervised method using SVM and the CEA features, whose ranking is based on the SVM scores
