VWe test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony []
p1
aVThe goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints
p2
aVOutput \u005ctextipa EtE violates Parse [atr], and has score 8
p3
aVOutputs \u005ctextipa Ete and \u005ctextipa etE violate both Harmony (weight 16) and Parse [atr] (weight 8), so their scores are 24
p4
aVThe IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w
p5
aVThe Wolof constraints provide an interesting testing ground for the model, because it is a small set of constraints to be learned, but contains the Harmony constraint, which can
