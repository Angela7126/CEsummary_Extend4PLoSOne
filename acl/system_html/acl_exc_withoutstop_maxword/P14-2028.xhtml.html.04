<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Consider we do not always transition deterministically to the next best correction, but instead transition randomly to a (potentially any ) correction with transition probability being equal to the posterior P ( c i c i - 1 ) , where c i - 1 is the correction we transition from, c i is the correction we transition to, and P ( u'\u22c5' u'\u22c5' ) is defined by Equation 1</a>
