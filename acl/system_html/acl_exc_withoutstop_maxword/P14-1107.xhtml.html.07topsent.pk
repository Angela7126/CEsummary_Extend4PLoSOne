VAs discussed, we model the collection of candidates as a weighted undirected graph, G C , in which nodes in the graph represent candidate sentences and edges represent lexical relatedness
p1
aVWe form two graphs the first graph ( G T ) represents Turkers (translator/editor pairs) as nodes; the second graph ( G C ) represents candidate translated and post-edited sentences (henceforth u'\u005cu201c' candidates u'\u005cu201d' ) as nodes

aVThe adjacency matrix [ M ] denotes the transition probabilities between candidates, and analogously matrix [ N ] denotes the affinity between Turker collaboration pairs
