Vu'\u005cu03a6' dep contains features for the probability of a dependency edge under a smoothed dependency grammar constructed from the Penn Treebank and various conjunctions of the following features a) whether the edge appears as a dependency or ancestral relation in the input parse (b) the directionality of the dependency (c) the label of the edge (d) the POS tags of the tokens incident to the edge and (e) the labels of their surrounding chunks and whether the edge remains within the chunk

aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram
