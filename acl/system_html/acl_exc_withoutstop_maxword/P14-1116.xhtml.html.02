<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, our domain for feedback generation is motivated by previous studies [] who show that text summaries are more effective in decision making than graphs therefore it is advantageous to provide a summary over showing users the raw data graphically</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The difference between the two methods lies in that the collective content selection requires the consideration of an individual preference score (which is defined as the preference of the entity to be selected or omitted, and it is based on the values of entity attributes and is computed using a boosting algorithm) and the identification of links between the entities with similar labels</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our contributions to the field are as follows we present a novel and efficient method for tackling the challenge of content selection using a ML classification approach; we applied this method to the domain of feedback summarisation; we present a comparison with an optimisation technique (Reinforcement Learning), and we discuss the similarities and differences between the two methods</a>
