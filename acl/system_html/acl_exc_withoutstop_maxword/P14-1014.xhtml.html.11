<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Previous work treats the learned representations either as model parameters that are further optimized in supervised fine-tuning [ 6 ] or as fixed features that are kept unchanged [ 26 , 8 ]</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We integrate the learned encoder with a set of well-established features for POS tagging [ 21 , 5 ] in a single neural network, which is applied as a scorer to an easy-first POS tagger</a>
