<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To model the tag dependency, previous neural network models [ 6 , 35 ] introduce a transition score A i u'\u2062' j for jumping from tag i u'\u2208' T to tag j u'\u2208' T</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, we integrate additional simple character bigram features into our model and the result shows that our model can achieve a competitive performance that other systems hardly achieve unless they use more complex task-specific features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By introducing tensor factorization into the neural network model for sequence labeling tasks, the model training and inference are speeded up and overfitting is prevented</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In conventional neural network models, however, the input embeddings only implicitly interact through the non-linear function which can</a>
