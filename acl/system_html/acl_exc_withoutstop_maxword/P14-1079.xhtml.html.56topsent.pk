VMoreover, Goldfrab and Ma [ 11 ] proved the convergence of the FPC algorithm for solving the nuclear norm minimization problem
p1
aVThe matrix rank minimization problem is NP-hard
p2
aVOur models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al
p3
aVSuppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d -dimensional textual features, and t labels (relations), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al
p4
aVIn such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank

aVMore specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels
p7
aVDue to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high
