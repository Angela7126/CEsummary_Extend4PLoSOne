VWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence
p1
aVFirst, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced
p2
aVThe models built on corpora can generally improve the correction detection accuracy 5 5 We currently do not evaluate the end-to-end system over different corpora
p3
aVOur analysis confirms that the merging step is the bottleneck in the current correction detection system u'\u005cu2013' it accounts for 75%
