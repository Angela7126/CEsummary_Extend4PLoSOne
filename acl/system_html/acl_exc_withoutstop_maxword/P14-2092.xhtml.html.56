<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For our skeletal language model, we trained a 5-gram language model on the target-side of the bilingual data by generalizing non-skeleton segments to Xs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We chose the default feature set of the NiuTrans.Phrase engine for building the baseline, including phrase translation probabilities, lexical weights, a 5-gram language model, word and phrase bonuses, a ME-based lexicalized reordering model</a>
