VCombining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and GParser ( u'\u005cu201c' Unlabeled u'\u005cu2190' B+G u'\u005cu201d' ), we get higher oracle score (96.37% on English and 89.72% on Chinese) and higher syntactic divergence (1.085 candidate heads per word on English, and 1.188 on Chinese) than u'\u005cu201c' Unlabeled u'\u005cu2190' Z+G u'\u005cu201d' , which verifies our earlier discussion that Berkeley Parser produces more different structures than ZPar
p1
aVTo construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []
p2
aVBoth work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical
p3
aVCombining the outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar ( u'\u005cu201c' Unlabeled u'\u005cu2190' B+Z u'\u005cu201d' ), we get the best performance on English, which is also significantly better than both co-training ( u'\u005cu201c' Unlabeled u'\u005cu2190' B u'\u005cu201d' ) and tri-training ( u'\u005cu201c' Unlabeled u'\u005cu2190' B=Z u'\u005cu201d' ) on both English and Chinese
p4
aVFinally, using a conditional random field (CRF) based probabilistic parser, we train a better model by maximizing mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings
p5
aVDifferent from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences
