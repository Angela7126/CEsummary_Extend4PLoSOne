<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, these new m 1 + m 2 -dimensional DAE features are added as extra features to the phrase table</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE u'\u2019' s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the u'\u201c' teacher u'\u201d' for semi-supervised back-propagation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, although we have introduced another four types of phrase features ( X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5 ), the only 16 features in X are a bottleneck for learning large hidden layers feature representation, because it has limited information, the performance of the high-dimensional DAE features which are directly learned from single DAE is not very satisfactory</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In summary, except for the first type of phrase feature X 1 which is used by [ Maskey and Zhou2012 ] , we introduce another four types of effective phrase features X 2 , X 3 , X 4 and X 5</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These new features are appended as extra features to the phrase table for the translation decoder</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We consider bidirectional phrase frequency as the input features, and estimate them as</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Using the 4 original phrase features in the phrase table as the input features, they pre-trained the DBN by contrastive divergence [ Hinton2002 ] , and generated new unsupervised DBN features using forward computation</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, we have the second type of input features</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Compared with the unsupervised DBN features, our semi-supervised DAE features are more effective and stable</a>
