<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This method allows us to u'\u2018' merge u'\u2019' words with emotions by summing the products of the weight of a word with the weight of the emotions in each document</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a next step we built a word-by-emotion matrix starting from M D u'\u2062' E using an approach based on compositional semantics</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Finally, we transformed M W u'\u2062' E by first applying normalization column-wise (so to eliminate the over representation for happiness as discussed in Section 3 ) and then scaling the data row-wise so to sum up to one</a>
