<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our study is consistent with this line of research, however, our model explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters and accordingly captures more semantic information</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The simple tag-tag transition neglects the impact of context characters and thus limits the ability to capture flexible interactions between tags and context characters</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
