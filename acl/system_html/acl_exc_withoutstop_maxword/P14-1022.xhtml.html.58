<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u2062' ( r</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Subsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Adding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser u'\u2019' s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The u'\u201c' Replaced u'\u201d' system modifies the Berkeley parser by replacing rare words with morphological descriptors of those words computed using language-specific modules, which have been hand-crafted for individual languages or are trained with additional annotation layers in the treebanks that we do not exploit</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, even when language-specific unknown word handling is added to the parser, our model still outperforms the Berkeley parser overall, showing that our model generalizes even better across languages than a parser for which this is touted as a strength [ 22 ]</a>
