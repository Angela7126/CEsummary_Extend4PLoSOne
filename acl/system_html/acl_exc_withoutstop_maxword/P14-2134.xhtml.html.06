<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We evaluate our model by confirming its face validity in a qualitative analysis and estimating its accuracy at the quantitative task of judging geographically-informed semantic similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For comparison, we also partition the data among all 51 states, and train a single model for each state using only data from that state</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a preprocessing step, we identify a set of target multiword expressions in this corpus as the maximal sequence of adjectives + nouns with the highest pointwise mutual information; in all experiments described below, we define the vocabulary V as the most frequent 100,000 terms (either unigrams or multiword expressions) in the total data, and set the dimensionality of the embedding k = 100</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While the two models that include geographical information naturally outperform the model that does not, the Joint model generally far outperforms the Individual models trained on state-specific subsets of the data</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This model defines a joint parameterization over all variable values in the data, where information from data originating in California, for instance, can influence the representations</a>
