VRecall from Section 3 that every span feature is conjoined with indicators over rules and rule parents to produce features over anchored rule productions; when we consider adding an annotation layer to the grammar, what that does is refine the rule indicators that are conjoined with every span feature
p1
aVHowever, negative features u'\u005cu2014' features that are not observed in any tree u'\u005cu2014' are still powerful indicators of (un)grammaticality if we have never seen a PRN that starts with u'\u005cu201c' has, u'\u005cu201d' or a span that begins with a quotation mark and ends with a close bracket, then we would like the model to be able to place negative weights on these features
p2
aVOur parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects
p3
aVOur span features appear to work well on both head-initial and head-final languages (see Basque and Korean in the table), and the fact that our parser performs well on such morphologically-rich languages as Hungarian indicates that our suffix model is sufficient to capture most of the morphological effects relevant to parsing
