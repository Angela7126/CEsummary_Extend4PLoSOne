<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our model builds on word2vec [] , a neural network based language model that learns word embeddings by maximizing the probability of raw text</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While RCM learns embeddings suited to specific tasks based on knowledge resources, cbow learns embeddings for words not included in the resource but appear in a corpus</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The cbow and RCM objectives use separate data for learning</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We propose a new training objective for learning word embeddings that incorporates prior knowledge</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we use the embeddings from a trained joint model to pre-train an RCM model</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We consider two resources for training the RCM term the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) [] and WordNet []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For each objective (cbow or RCM), we sample 15 words as negative samples for each training instance according to their frequencies in raw texts (i.e., training data of cbow</a>
