<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So before turning to the analysis of discourse phenomena, we examine the correlation between translation quality and sentence length</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To investigate the prevalence of sentences in the source language (Chinese and Arabic in our case) that do not confirm to the notion of sentence in the target language (English for the purposes of this study), we separate the translation segments in the source language into two classes a source sentence is considered 1-1 if the reference translation consists of exactly one sentence, and 1-many if the reference contains more than one sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Discourse structure has largely been considered irrelevant to MT, mostly due to the assumption that discourse analysis is needed to interpret multi-sentential text while statistical MT systems are trained to translate a single sentence in one language into a single sentence in another</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Obviously, the mismatch in implicit/explicit expression of discourse relation is related to the first problem we studied, i.e.,,</a>
