<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this case the environment of a learning agent is one or more other agents that can also be learning at the same time</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This ability of multi-agent RL can also have important implications for learning via live interaction with human users</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, unlike single-agent RL, multi-agent RL can handle changes in user behavior or in the behavior of other agents participating in the interaction, and thus potentially lead to more realistic dialogue policies in complex dialogue scenarios</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>1) we propose concurrent learning using multi-agent RL as a way to deal with some of the issues of current approaches to dialogue policy learning (i.e.,, the need for SUs and corpora), which may also potentially prove useful for learning via live interaction with human users; (2) we show that concurrent learning can address changes in user behavior over time, and requires multi-agent RL techniques and variable exploration rates; (3) to our knowledge this is the first time that PHC and PHC-WoLF are used for learning dialogue policies; (4) for the first time, the above techniques are applied to a negotiation domain; and (5) this is the first study that compares Q-learning, PHC, and PHC-WoLF in such a variety of situations (varying a large number of parameters</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus the environment of an agent is one or more other agents that continuously change their behavior because they are also learning at the same time</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus, when converging to the maximum total utility solution, in the case of 4 fruits (4 apples and 4 oranges), the average reward of the two agents should be 1200 minus 10 for making or accepting an offer</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus below we focus only on research that is directly related to our work, specifically research on concurrent learning of the policies of multiple agents, and the application of RL to negotiation domains</a>
