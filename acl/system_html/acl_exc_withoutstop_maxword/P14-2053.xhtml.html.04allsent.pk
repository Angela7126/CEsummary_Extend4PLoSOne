V1) evaluation of our generated questions, (2) comparison of our generated questions with those from Heilman and Smith u'\u005cu2019' s question generator, and (3) comparison of our generated questions with those from Lindberg, Popowich, Nesbit and Winne
p1
aVThe vast majority of systems generate questions by selecting one sentence at a time, extracting portions of the source sentence, then applying transformation rules or patterns in order to construct a question
p2
aVThis work most closely parallels our own with a few exceptions our system only asks questions that can be answered from the source text, our approach is domain-independent, and the patterns also identify the answer to the question
p3
aVFrom each system, 100 questions were randomly selected, making sure that the LPN W questions did not include questions generated from domain-specific templates such as
p4
aVThe file has 93 sentences and our system generated 184 questions; the LPN W system generated roughly 4 times as many questions
p5
aVBased on this sample of questions there is no significant difference in linguistic scores for questions generated at various predicate positions
p6
aV2013), which used semantic role labeling to identify patterns in the source text from which questions can be generated
p7
aVThe patterns are designed to match only the arguments used as part of the question or the answer, in order to prevent over generation of questions
p8
aVIn a related work (Mazidi and Nielsen, 2014) we evaluated the quality of the questions and answers from a pedagogical perspective, and our approach outperformed comparable systems in both linguistic and pedagogical evaluations
p9
aVGeneration patterns specify the text, verb forms and semantic arguments from the source sentence to form the question
p10
aVThe ability to generate questions from any predicate-argument set means that sentence simplification is not required as a preprocessing step, and that the sentence can match multiple patterns
p11
aVThis task utilized a file (Biology the body) with 56 source sentences from which our system generated 102 questions
p12
aVThen questions are generated and stored by question type in a question hash table
p13
aVWe compared our system to the H S and LPN W systems because they produce questions that are the most similar to ours, and for the same purpose reading comprehension reinforcement
p14
aVSyntactic, sentence-level approaches outnumber other approaches as seen in the Question Generation Shared Task Evaluation Challenge 2010 (Boyer and Piwek, 2010) which received only one paragraph-level, semantic entry
p15
aVWe only took questions that scored a 2.0 or better with their ranking system, 4 4 In our experiments, their rankings ranged from very small negative numbers to 3.0 which resulted in less than 27% of their top questions
p16
aVArgawal, Shah and Mannem (2011) continue the paragraph-level approach using discourse cues to find appropriate text segments upon which to construct questions at a deeper conceptual level
p17
aVHeilman and Smith chose to filter out questions with personal pronouns, possessive pronouns and noun phrases composed simply of determiners such as those
p18
aVA recent approach from Heilman and Smith (2009, 2010) uses syntactic parsing and transformation rules to generate questions
p19
aVSome question generation systems simplify complex sentences in initial stages of their system
p20
aVThis pattern also requires that ArgM contain nouns (AxNN from Table 1), which helps filter vague questions
p21
aVStudies of student learning show that answering questions increases depth of student learning, facilitates transfer learning, and improves students u'\u005cu2019' retention of material (McDaniel et al., 2007; Carpenter, 2012; Roediger and Pyc, 2012
p22
aVThe uniqueness of their work lies in their use of discourse cues to extract semantic content for question generation
p23
aVSENNA provides the tokenizing, pos tagging, syntactic constituency parsing and semantic role labeling used in the system
p24
aVThis paper focuses on evaluating generated questions primarily in terms of their linguistic quality, as did Heilman and Smith (2010a
p25
aVFor a comparison with the Lindberg, Popowich, Nesbit and Winne system we used a file (Earth science weather fronts) that seemed most similar to the text files for which their system was designed
p26
aVNegation detection is a complicated task because negation can occur at the word, phrase or clause level, and because there are subtle shades of negation between definite positive and negative polarities (Blanco and Moldovan, 2011
p27
aVFor each predicate and its associated semantic arguments, a matcher function is called which will return a list of patterns that match the source sentence u'\u005cu2019' s predicate-argument structure
p28
aVAs seen in Table 4, our results represent a 44% reduction in the error rate relative to Heilman and Smith on the average rating over all metrics, and as high as 61% reduction in the error rate on grammaticality judgments
p29
aVThe purpose of this evaluation was to determine if any patterns consistently produce poor questions
p30
aVFor example, this sentence could also match patterns to generate questions such as
p31
aVAdditionally, patterns indicate the semantic arguments that provide the answer to the question, required fields, and filter condition fields
p32
aVAs these patterns are matched, they will be rejected as candidates for generation for a particular sentence if the required arguments are absent or if filter conditions are present
p33
aVHowever, the task here is to explore the linguistic quality of generated questions
p34
aVPlant roots and bacterial decay use carbon dioxide in the process of respiration, the word use was classified as NN, leaving no predicate and no semantic role labels in this sentence
p35
aVThe system inserted the correct forms of release and do , and ignored the phrase As this occurs since it is not part of the semantic argument
p36
aVLight verbs can either carry semantic meaning ( take your passport) or can be bleached of semantic content when combined with other words as in make a decision, have a drink, take a walk
p37
aVFor example, a filter for personal pronouns will prevent a question being generated with an argument that starts with a personal pronoun
p38
aVSince our focus is on expository text, system patterns deal primarily with the present and simple past tenses
p39
aVBonds) which had 59 sentences, from which the system generated 142 questions
p40
aVThe pattern that generated Question 2 requires A0, A1 and a verb whose lexical form is mean (V=mean in Table 1
p41
aVThe aim of this work is to automatically generate questions for such pedagogical purposes
p42
aVSince current state-of-the-art systems do not deal well with relative and possessive pronouns, this will continue to be a limitation of natural language generation systems for the time being
p43
aVThe pattern that generated Question 1 requires argument A1 (underlined in Table 2) and a causation ArgM (italicized
p44
aVThese approaches can potentially ask deeper questions due to their focus on semantics
p45
aVThe questions again were presented with accompanying paragraphs of the source text
p46
aVSENNA produces separate semantic role labels for each predicate in the sentence
p47
aVA well-known early work is Wolfe u'\u005cu2019' s AUTOQUEST (Wolfe, 1976), a syntactic pattern matching system
p48
aVCare must be taken not to generate questions based on one predicate in the catenative construction
p49
aVTwo annotators evaluated each set of questions using Likert-scale ratings from 1 to 5, where 5 is the best rating, for grammaticality, clarity, and naturalness
p50
aVHowever, further work on filters is needed to avoid questions such as
p51
aVThis pattern supplies the word indicate instead of the source text u'\u005cu2019' s mean which broadens the question context
p52
aVQuestions from the two systems were randomly intermingled
p53
aVWe have left for future work the task of identifying other negative indicators, which occasionally does lead to poor question/answer quality as in the following
p54
aVThe average inter-annotator agreement, allowing a difference of one between the annotators u'\u005cu2019' ratings was 88% and Pearson u'\u005cu2019' s r=0.47 was statistically significant (p 0.001), suggesting a high correlation and agreement between annotators
p55
aVApproaches to automatic question generation from text span nearly four decades
p56
aVHowever, most patterns use the lexical form of the main verb along with the appropriate form of the auxiliary do (do, does, did), for the subject-auxiliary inversion required in forming interrogatives
p57
aVAnnotators were given instructions to read a paragraph, then the questions based on that paragraph
p58
aVTable 2 provides examples of generated questions
p59
aVIn our approach this is unnecessary, and simplifying could miss many valid questions
p60
aVFor our purposes we focused on negation as identified by the NEG label in SENNA which identified not in verb phrases
p61
aVInterestingly, our system again achieved a 44% reduction in the error rate when averaging over all metrics, just as it did in the Heilman and Smith comparison
p62
aVQuestion 3 is from the source sentence u'\u005cu2019' s 3rd predicate-argument set because this matched the pattern requirements
p63
aVLindberg et al used the emPronoun system from Charniak and Elsner, which only handles personal pronouns
p64
aVPatterns specify whether verbs should be included in their lexical form or as they appear in the source text
p65
aVIt means that the universe is expanding , we do not want to generate a vague question such as
p66
aVThe Heilman and Smith system is available online; 3 3 http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/mheilman/questions/ Lindberg graciously shared his code with us
p67
aVHere we briefly describe three challenges negation detection, coreference resolution, and verb forms
p68
aVThey generate questions of types why , when , give an example , and yes/no
p69
aVCoreference resolution, which could help avoid vague question generation, is discussed in Section 5
p70
aVIn contrast to the above systems, other approaches have an intermediate step of transforming input into some sort of semantic representation
p71
aVExperiments with existing coreference software performed well only for personal pronouns, which occur infrequently in most expository text
p72
aVThe system at the time of this evaluation had 42 patterns
p73
aVQuestion 4 requires A1 and an ArgM that includes the discourse cue if
p74
aVWe were also interested to know if first predicates make better questions than later ones
p75
aVIn this pattern, A1 (italicized) forms the answer and A0 (underlined) becomes part of the question along with the appropriate form of do
p76
aVIn all, 84 of their questions were evaluated
p77
aVLight verbs pose complications in NLG because they are highly idiosyncratic and subject to syntactic variability (Sag et al., 2002
p78
aVThe system was created using SENNA and Python
p79
aVImporting NLTK within Python provides a simple interface to WordNet from which we determine the lexical form of verbs
p80
aVIf you continue to move atoms closer and closer together, eventually the two nuclei will begin to repel each other
p81
aVNatural language generation faces many linguistic challenges
p82
aVSENNA uses the 2005 PropBank coding scheme and we followed the documentation in (Babko-Malaya, 2005) for the patterns
p83
aVFirst, the source text is divided into sentences which are processed by SENNA 1 1 http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/ software, described in (Collobert et al., 2011
p84
aVThe ArgM (underlined) becomes part of the question, while the rest of the source sentence forms the answer
p85
aVIn order to generate questions, passages were selected from science textbooks downloaded from www.ck12.org
p86
aVThe most commonly used semantic roles are A0, A1 and A2, as well as the ArgM modifiers
p87
aVThe annotators are university students who are science majors and native speakers of English
p88
aVThe most common error observed was confusion between the noun and verb roles of a word
p89
aVTable 1 shows selected required and filter fields, Section 3.3 gives examples of their use
p90
aVCurrently, our system does not use any type of coreference resolution
p91
aVThis pattern takes the copular be as it appears in the source text
p92
aVExamples of this intermediate step can be found in Yao and Zhang (2010) which uses Minimal Recursive Semantics, and in Olney et al
p93
aVCommon English verbs that can be light verbs include give, have, make, take
p94
aVThe average linguistics score per pattern in this evaluation was 5.0 to 4.18
p95
aVThe average score by predicate position is shown in Table 3
p96
aVThe system consists of a straightforward pipeline
p97
aVWe are also hindered at times by the performance of the part of speech tagging and parsing software
p98
aVNot having coreference resolution leads to vague questions, some of which can be filtered as discussed previously
p99
aV2012) leverages lexico-syntactic patterns gleaned from the web with seed question-answer pairs

aVA novel question generator by Curto et al
p103
aVFor the experiments in this paper, we selected three passages from the subjects of biology, chemistry, and earth science, filtering out references to equations and figures
p104
aVTextbooks were chosen rather than hand-crafted source material so that a more realistic assessment of performance could be achieved
p105
aVSome patterns look for modals and so can handle future tense
p106
aVThe passages average around 60 sentences each, and represent chapter sections
p107
aVThe most common use of the verb as it appears in the sentence is with the verb be , as in

aVNote that the Rating column gives the average of the grammaticality, clarity and naturalness scores
p112
aVThe catenative construction also potentially adds complexity (Huddleston and Pullum, 2005), as shown in this example
p113
aVHandling these constructions as well as other multi-word expressions may require both rule-based and statistical approaches
