<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The chunk size directly determines the latency of the system to the end user, as alignment cannot begin until an entire chunk is captured</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second, the fixed window alignment algorithm requires longer chunks ( u'\u2265' 10 seconds) to obtain reasonable accuracy, and thus introduces unsatisfactory latency</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Larger chunks are more accurately aligned but require computation time that grows as N K in the chunk size N in the worst case</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The fact that the various instances of a single word in each transcription may fall on either side of a chunk boundary leads to errors where a word is either duplicated in the final output for more than one chunk, or omitted entirely</a>
