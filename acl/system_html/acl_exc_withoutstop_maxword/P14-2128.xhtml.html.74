<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with no ambiguity</a>
