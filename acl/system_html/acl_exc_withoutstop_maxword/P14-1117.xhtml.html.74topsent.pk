VFurthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] , in which questions of efficiency are paramount due to the larger problems involved; however, these approaches largely restrict compression to pruning parse trees, thereby imposing a dependency on parser performance

aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions
