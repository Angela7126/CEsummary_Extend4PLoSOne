<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, given the distribution w u'\u2192' \cS of a word w in the source domain \cS , we propose an unsupervised method for predicting its distribution w u'\u2192' \cT in a different target domain \cT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By predicting the distribution of a word across different domains, we can find source domain features that are similar to the features in target domain reviews, thereby reducing the mismatch of features between the two domains</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using two popular multi-domain datasets, we evaluate the proposed method in two prediction tasks a) predicting the POS of a word in a target domain, and (b) predicting the sentiment of a review in a target domain</a>
