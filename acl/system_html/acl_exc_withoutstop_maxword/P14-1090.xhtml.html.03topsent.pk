VFor each question, we extracted all relations in its corresponding topic graph, and ranked each relation with whether it is the answer relation
p1
aV2 precision) predict the answer relation from the question
p2
aVThus for the question, who is the father of King George VI , we ask two questions does the mapping, 1 coverage) contain the answer relation people.person.parents
p3
aVWe call this a question feature graph , with every node and relation a potential feature for this question
p4
aVFor instance, for the previous example question, we want to rank the relation people.person.parents as number 1
p5
aVTable 1 shows the coverage of CluewebMapping, which covers 93.0 u'\u005cu2062' % of all answer relations
p6
aVThus for the Freebase graph, we use relations (with directions) and properties as features for each node
p7
aVSpecifically, for each relation r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' l in a topic graph, we compute P ( r e l
