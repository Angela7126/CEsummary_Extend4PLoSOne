<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Columns correspond to the candidate words, words obtained in the cluster of each candidate word (we will use the term u'\u2018' birth cluster u'\u2019' for these words, henceforth), which indicated a new sense, the results of manual evaluation as well as the possible sense this birth cluster denotes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Similarly, for a candidate sense change from t u'\u2062' v i to t u'\u2062' v j , we say that the location of the sense change is t u'\u2062' v j if and only if that sense change does not get detected by comparing t u'\u2062' v i with any time interval t u'\u2062' v k , intermediate between t u'\u2062' v i and t u'\u2062' v j</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Remarkably, comparison with the English WordNet indicates that in 44% cases, as identified by our algorithm, there has been a birth of a completely novel sense, in 46% cases a new sense has split off from an older sense and in 43% cases two or more older senses have merged in to form a new sense</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Toward this objective we make the following contributions a) devise a time-varying graph clustering based sense induction algorithm, (b) use the time-varying sense clusters to develop a split-join based approach for identifying new senses of a word, and (c) evaluate the performance of the algorithms on various datasets using different suitable approaches along with a detailed error analysis</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In Section 4 we present an approach based on graph clustering to identify the time-varying sense clusters and in Section 5 we present the split-merge based approach for tracking word sense changes</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If a word undergoes sense change, this can be detected by comparing the sense clusters obtained from two different time periods by the algorithm outlined above</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since it was difficult to go through all the candidate sense changes for all the comparisons manually, we decided to randomly select some candidate words, which were flagged by our algorithm as undergoing sense change, while comparing 1909-1953 and 2002-2005 DT</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For a candidate word flagged as birth, we first find out the set of all WordNet synset ids for its CW clusters in the source time period (1909-1953 in this case</a>
