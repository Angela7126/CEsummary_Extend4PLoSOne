<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Specifically, in POS tagging, a CRF trained on source domain labeled sentences is applied to target domain test sentences, whereas in sentiment classification, a logistic regression classifier trained using source domain labeled reviews is applied to the target domain test reviews</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The main reason that a model trained only on the source domain labeled data performs poorly in the target domain is the feature mismatch u'\u2013' few features in target domain test instances appear in source domain training instances</a>
