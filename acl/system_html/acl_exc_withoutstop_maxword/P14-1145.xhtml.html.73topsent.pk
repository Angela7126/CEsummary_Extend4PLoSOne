VThe connotation graph, called G Word+Sense , is a heterogeneous graph with multiple types of nodes and edges
p1
aVOur belief propagation based connotation sentiment inference algorithm has one user-specified parameter u'\u005cu0395' (see Table 1
p2
aVAs shown in Figure 1 , it contains two types of nodes; (i) lemmas (i.e.,, words, 115K) and (ii) synsets (63K), and four types of edges; ( t 1 ) predicate-argument (179K), ( t 2 ) argument-argument (144K), ( t 3 ) argument-synset (126K), and ( t 4 ) synset-synset (3.4K) edges
p3
aVThe G Word+Sense w/ SynSim graphs use an additional compatibility matrix for the synset similarity edges of type t 5 , which is the same as the one used for t 1 , i.e.,, similar synsets are likely to have the same connotation label
