<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, Table 4 shows that by incorporating correction patterns into the merging algorithm, the errors in correction detection step were reduced</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The models built on corpora can generally improve the correction detection accuracy 5 5 We currently do not evaluate the end-to-end system over different corpora</a>
