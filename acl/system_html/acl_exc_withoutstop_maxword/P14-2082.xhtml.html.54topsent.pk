VWe lean toward higher annotator agreement with relations that have greater separation between their semantics 4 4 For instance, a relation like starts is a special case of includes if events are viewed as open intervals, and immediately before is a special case of before

aVIn contrast, we aim for a shift in the community wherein all pairs are considered candidates for temporal ordering, allowing researchers to ask questions such as how must algorithms adapt to label the complete graph of pairs, and if the more difficult and ambiguous event pairs are included, how must feature-based learners change

aVThey have the densest annotation, but u'\u005cu201c' the annotator was not required to annotate all pairs of event mentions, but as many as possible u'\u005cu201d' .This paper takes a different tack to annotation by requiring annotators to label every possible pair of events/times in a given window
