<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To do this, we formulate the problem as a text regression task, and use a Gaussian copula with probability integral transform to model the uniform marginals and their dependencies</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In NLP, many of the probabilistic text models work in the discrete space [ 9 , 2 ] , but our model is different since the text features are sparse, we first perform kernel density estimates to smooth out the zeroing items, and then calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variables</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given a piece of earnings call transcript, we investigate a semiparametric approach for automatic prediction of future financial risk 1 1 In this work, the risk is defined as the measured volatility of stock prices from the week following the earnings call teleconference</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The idea behind copula theory is that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random vector can be represented in the form of uniform marginal cumulative distribution functions, and a copula that connects these marginal CDFs, which describes the correlations among the input random variables</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On one hand, copula models [ 31 ] seek to explicitly model the dependency of random variables by separating the marginals and their correlations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Again, the reason why we perform approximated inference is that exact inference in the high-dimensional Gaussian copula density is non-trivial, and might not have analytical solutions,</a>
