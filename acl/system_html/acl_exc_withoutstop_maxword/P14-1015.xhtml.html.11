<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In short, each solution word is assumed to be generated from the language model or the translation model (conditioned on the problem words) with a probability of u'\u039b' and 1 - u'\u039b' respectively, thus accounting for the correlation assumption</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>All solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As outlined in Table 2 , each ( p , r ) pair would be assigned to one of the classes, solution or non-solution, based on whether it conforms better with the solution models (i.e.,, u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S ) or non-solution models ( u'\ud835' u'\udcae' N u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' N ), as determined using the F u'\u2062' ( ( p , r ) , u'\ud835' u'\udcae' , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ) function, i.e</a>
