<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, due to a widespread assumption that infants do not know the meanings of many words at the age when they are learning phonetic categories (see 42 for a review), most recent models of early phonetic category acquisition have explored the phonetic learning problem in the absence of semantic information ( 8 ; 9 ; 11 ; 26 ; 50 )</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since our model is not a model of the learning process, we do not compare the infant learning process to the learning algorithm.) We evaluate both the inferred phonetic categories and words using the clustering evaluation measure V-Measure (VM; 36</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper we explore the potential contribution of semantic information to phonetic learning by formalizing a model in which learners attend to the word-level context in which phones appear (as in the lexical-phonetic learning model of 11 ) and also to the situations in which word-forms are used</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is the baseline IGMM model, which clusters vowel tokens using bottom-up distributional information only; the LD model adds top-down information by assigning categories in the lexicon, rather than on the token level</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The TLD model retains the IGMM vowel phone component, but extends the lexicon of the LD model by adding topic-specific lexicons, which capture the notion that lexeme probabilities are topic-dependent</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We therefore obtain the topic distributions used as input to the TLD model by training an LDA topic model ( 5 ) on a superset of the child-directed transcript data we use for lexical-phonetic learning, dividing the transcripts into small sections (the u'\u2018' documents u'\u2019' in LDA) that serve as our distinct situations u'\ud835' u'\udc89'</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Again performance decreases as the consonant categories become coarser, but the additional semantic information in the TLD model compensates for the lack of consonant information</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The topic-word distributions learned by LDA are discarded, since these are based on the (correct and unambiguous) words in the transcript, whereas the TLD model is presented with phonetically ambiguous versions of these word tokens and must learn</a>
