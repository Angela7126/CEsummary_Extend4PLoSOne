<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since then, there has been an explosion of research addressing various aspects of the problem, including detecting subjectivity, rating and classifying sentiment, labeling sentiment-related semantic roles (e.g.,, target of sentiment), and visualizing sentiment (see surveys by and</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This could suggest that additional external knowledge, e.g.,, that from human-built resources or automatically learned from other data (e.g.,, as in [] ), including sentiment that cannot be inferred from its constituent expressions, might be incorporated to benefit the current neural-network-based models as prior knowledge</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The table shows that the basic reversing and shifting heuristics do capture negators u'\u2019' behavior to some degree, as their MAE scores are higher than that of the baseline</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Such models work in a bottom-up fashion over the parse tree of a sentence to infer the sentiment label of the sentence as a composition of the sentiment expressed by its constituting parts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Note that the two neural network based models incorporate the syntax and semantics by representing each node with a vector</a>
