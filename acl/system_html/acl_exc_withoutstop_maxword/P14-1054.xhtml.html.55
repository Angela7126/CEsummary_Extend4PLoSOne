<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Those are generated by combining two entity types or two entity subtypes into a semantic pair</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Head noun and adjacent entity POS tag are employed to combine with positional information</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic pair is generated by combining two semantic units</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Except in Row 8 and Row 11, when two head nouns of entity pair were combined as semantic pair and when POS tag were combined with the entity type, the performances are decreased</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is encoded by combining the POS tag with the adjacent entity mention information</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Both head noun and POS tag are position sensitive</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Because the relation arguments are order sensitive, six entity mention pairs can be generated</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In order to give a better comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, based on our experiment settings and data, we implement the two feature based methods proposed by Che et al</a>
