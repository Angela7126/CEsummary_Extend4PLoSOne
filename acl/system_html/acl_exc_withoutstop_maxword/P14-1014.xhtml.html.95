<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Compared with the performance of the official baseline (row 4 of Table 6), which is evaluated based on the output of BerkeleyParser [ 16 , 17 ] , our baseline tagger achieves comparable accuracies on both the source and target domain data</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, since fine-tuning is conducted with respect to the source domain , adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained representation towards optimizing source domain tagging accuracies would disrupt its ability in modelling the web domain data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is consistent with previous work (Le Roux et al., 2011), which found that for noisy data such as web domain text, data cleaning is a effective and necessary step</a>
