<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In fact, RCM does not even observe all the words that appear in the training set, so it makes little sense to use the RCM embeddings directly for language modeling</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on our initial experiments, RCM uses the output embeddings of cbow</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While RCM learns embeddings suited to specific tasks based on knowledge resources, cbow learns embeddings for words not included in the resource but appear in a corpus</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After obtaining trained embeddings from any of our objectives, we use the embeddings in the word2vec model to measure perplexity of the test set</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We propose a new training objective for learning word embeddings that incorporates prior knowledge</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In each setting, we will compare the word2vec baseline embedding trained with cbow against RCM alone, the joint</a>
