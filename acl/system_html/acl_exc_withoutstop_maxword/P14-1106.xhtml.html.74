<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The syntactic reordering model takes a CFG rule (e.g.,, VP u'\u2192' VP u'\u2062' PP u'\u2062' PP ) and models the reordering of the constituents on the left hand side by examining their translation or visit order according to the target language</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To get the two semantic reordering model feature values, we simply use Algorithm 1 and its associated functions from u'\u2131' 1 to u'\u2131' 5 replacing a CFG rule cfg with a PAS pas , and a constituent u'\ud835' u'\udc4b' u'\ud835' u'\udc43' i with a semantic role u'\ud835' u'\udc45' i</a>
