<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We report results on the test sets, after training on both the training and development sets</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The results of this experiment are reported in the Indicative Bigrams column of Table 2</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In the second experiment, we found that the majority of the most indicative character bigrams are shared among different language sets</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The results are shown in the Random Words column of Table 2</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For comparison, the Random Bigrams column of Table 2 shows the mean accuracy over 100 trials obtained when 20 bigrams randomly selected from the set of 200 bigrams are replaced with random bigrams from outside of the set</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The words that are identified as the most discriminative include function words, punctuation, very common content words, and the toponymic terms</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The results of the second experiment reveal that the most indicative bigrams are quite similar across different language sets</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the first experiment, we showed that the removal of the 100 most discriminative words from the training data results in a significant drop in the accuracy of the classifier that is based exclusively on</a>
