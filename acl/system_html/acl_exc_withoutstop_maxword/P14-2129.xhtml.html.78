<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Segmentation accuracy is reported as an F1-score of unlabeled segment bracketing</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, Figure 3 shows the speed of inference, labeled precision and labeled recall of annotating hedge constituents on the test set as a function of the maximum span parameter L , versus the baseline parser</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>After applying such a transform to a treebank, we can induce grammars and modify parsing to search as needed to recover just these constituents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Space constraints preclude inclusion of trials with this method, but the net result is a severe degradation in accuracy (tens of points of F-measure) versus standard parsing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Note that segmentation time is negligible compared to the parsing time, hence is omitted in reported time</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this paper, we propose several methods to parse hedge constituents and examine their accuracy/efficiency tradeoffs</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our task is to learn which words can begin ( B ) a hedge constituent</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Given a set of labeled pairs ( S , H ) where S is a sentence of n words w 1 u'\u2062' u'\u2026' u'\u2062' w n and H is its hedge parse tree, word w b belongs to B if there is a hedge constituent spanning w b u'\u2062' u'\u2026' u'\u2062' w</a>
