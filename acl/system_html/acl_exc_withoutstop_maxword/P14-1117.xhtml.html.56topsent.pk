VFollowing this, § 2.3 discusses a dynamic program to find maximum weight bigram subsequences from the input sentence, while § 2.4 covers LP relaxation-based approaches for approximating solutions to the problem of finding a maximum-weight subtree in a graph of potential output dependencies

aVFurthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression, also known as compressive summarization [ 34 , 2 , 1 , 30 , 41 ] , in which questions of efficiency are paramount due to the larger problems involved; however, these approaches largely restrict compression to pruning parse trees, thereby imposing a dependency on parser performance

aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach
