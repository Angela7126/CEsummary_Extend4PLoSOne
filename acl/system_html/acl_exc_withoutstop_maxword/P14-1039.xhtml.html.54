<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To improve word ordering decisions, White Rajkumar [ 36 ] demonstrated that incorporating a feature into the ranker inspired by Gibson u'\u2019' s [ 12 ] dependency locality theory can deliver statistically significant improvements in automatic evaluation scores, better match the distributional characteristics of sentence orderings, and significantly reduce the number of serious ordering errors (some involving vicious ambiguities) as confirmed by a targeted human evaluation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Rajkumar White [ 28 , 36 ] have recently shown that some rather egregious surface realization errors u'\u2014' in the sense that the reader would likely end up with the wrong interpretation u'\u2014' can be avoided by making use of features inspired by psycholinguistics research together with an otherwise state-of-the-art averaged perceptron realization ranking model [ 35 ] , as reviewed in the next section</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In sum, although simple ranking helps to avoid vicious ambiguity in some cases, the overall results of simple ranking are no better than the perceptron model (according to BLEU, at least), as parse failures that are not reflective of human intepretive tendencies too often lead the ranker to choose dispreferred realizations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this analysis, we consider whether the reranked realization improves upon or detracts from realization quality u'\u2014' in terms of adequacy, fluency, both or neither u'\u2014' along with a linguistic categorization of the differences between the reranked realization and the original top-ranked realization according to the averaged perceptron model</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model u'\u2019' s BLEU score of 87.93</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer u'\u2019' s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker</a>
