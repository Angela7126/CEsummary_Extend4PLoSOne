<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, unlike BabySRL, the model presented here provides a cognitive model of the acquisition of filler-gap comprehension, which BabySRL does not seem well-suited to model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The 1-1 role bias error rate (before training) of the model presented in this paper is comparable to that of and , which shows that the current model provides comparable developmental modeling benefits to the BabySRL models</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In sum, the unlexicalized model presented in this paper is able to achieve greater labelling accuracy than the lexicalized BabySRL models in intransitive settings, though this model does perform slightly worse in the less common transitive setting</a>
