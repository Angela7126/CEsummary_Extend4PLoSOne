<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>What is the effect of including the proposed measure of syntactic complexity in the state-of-the-art automatic scoring model</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Subsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, including our proposed measure of syntactic complexity in an automatic scoring model results in a statistically significant performance gain over the state-of-the-art</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Here we outline the multiple stages involved in the automatic syntactic complexity assessment</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The various objective measures are then combined in the multiple regression scoring model to generate an overall score of proficiency</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The focus of this study is the design and performance analysis of a measure of the syntactic complexity of non-native English responses for use in automatic scoring systems</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Guided by studies in second</a>
