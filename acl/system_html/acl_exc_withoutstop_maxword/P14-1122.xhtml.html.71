<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For all three games, two players play the same game under time limits and then are rewarded if their answers match</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These mechanics ensure the game naturally produces better quality annotations; in contrast, common crowdsourcing platforms do not support analogous mechanics for enforcing this type of correctness at annotation time</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For each task we developed a video game with a purpose that integrates the task within the game, as illustrated in Sections 4 and 5</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The strength of both crowdsourcing and games with a purpose comes from aggregating multiple annotations of a single item; i.e.,, while IAA</a>
