<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The results of this experiment are reported in the Indicative Bigrams column of Table 2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using Algorithm 2 , we identify the top 20 character bigrams, and replace them with randomly selected bigrams</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We replicate the experiments of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) by limiting the features to the 200 most frequent character bigrams</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The results are shown in the Baseline column of Table 2</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, we limit the set of features to the 200 most frequent bigrams for the sake of consistency with previous work</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The words that are identified as the most discriminative include function words, punctuation, very common content words, and the toponymic terms</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The remaining bigrams indicate function words, toponymic terms like Germany , and frequent content words like take and new</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We follow the setup of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) by extracting two sets, denoted I1 and I2 (Table 1 ), from the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE), Version 2 [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using Algorithm 2 , we identify the 100 most discriminative words, and remove them from the training data</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As the orthography of alphabetic languages is at least partially representative of the underlying phonology, character bigrams may capture these phonological preferences</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, the fact that the two bigrams are also on the list for the I2 set, which does not include these languages, suggests that their importance is mostly due to the function words</a>
