<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While choosing arg u'\u2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To turn random walk into deterministic spelling correction algorithm, we de-randomize it, using the following transformation</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Iterative correction then turns into a random walk we start at word c 0 = q and stop after E random steps at some word c E , which</a>
