<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We vary the scenario complexity (i.e.,, the quantity of resources to be shared and consequently the state space size), the number of training episodes, the learning rate, and the exploration rate</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Figures 6 and 7 show the average distance from the convergence reward as a function of the number of episodes per epoch during training, for 4 and 5 fruits respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this case the environment of a learning agent is one or more other agents that can also be learning at the same time</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>1) we propose concurrent learning using multi-agent RL as a way to deal with some of the issues of current approaches to dialogue policy learning (i.e.,, the need for SUs and corpora), which may also potentially prove useful for learning via live interaction with human users; (2) we show that concurrent learning can address changes in user behavior over time, and requires multi-agent RL techniques and variable exploration rates; (3) to our knowledge this is the first time that PHC and PHC-WoLF are used for learning dialogue policies; (4) for the first time, the above techniques are applied to a negotiation domain; and (5) this is the first study that compares Q-learning, PHC, and PHC-WoLF in such a variety of situations (varying a large number of parameters</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, when converging to the maximum total utility solution, in the case of 4 fruits (4 apples and 4 oranges), the average reward of the two agents should be 1200 minus 10 for making or accepting an offer</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On the other hand when the agent is u'\u201c' losing u'\u201d' the learning rate u'\u0394' L u'\u2062' F should be high so that the agent has more time to adapt to the other agents u'\u2019' policies, which also facilitates convergence</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given that Agent 1 is more interested in apples and Agent 2 cares more about oranges, the maximum total utility solution would be the case where each agent offers to get all the fruits it cares about and to give its interlocutor all the fruits it does not care about, and the other agent accepts this offer</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Also, they have human-like constraints of imperfect information about each other; they do not know each other u'\u2019' s reward function or degree of rationality (during learning our agents can be irrational</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is to make all graphs comparable because in all cases the optimal average distance from the convergence reward of the two agents should be equal to 10 (make the optimal offer or accept the optimal offer that the other agent makes</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As the number of fruits increases, Q-learning starts performing worse than the multi-agent RL algorithms</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For 7 fruits PHC-W appears to perform worse than Q-learning</a>
