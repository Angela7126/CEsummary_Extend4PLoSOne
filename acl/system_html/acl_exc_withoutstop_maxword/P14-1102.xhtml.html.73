<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Similar to the model presented in this paper, BabySRL is based on simple ordering features such as argument position relative to the verb and argument position relative to the other arguments</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The model represents the preferred locations of semantic roles relative to the verb as distributions over real numbers</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The BabySRL corpus is annotated with 5 different roles, but the model described in this paper only uses 2 roles</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, the one-to-one role bias is explicitly encoded such that the model cannot use a label that has already been used elsewhere in the sentence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since the model is not lexicalized, these roles correspond to the semantic roles most commonly associated with subject and object</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since the model is unsupervised, it is trained on a given corpus (e.g., Eve) before being tested on the role annotations of that same corpus</a>
