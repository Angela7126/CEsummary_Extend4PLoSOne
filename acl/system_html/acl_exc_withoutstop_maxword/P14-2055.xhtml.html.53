<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In practice for both tasks, a new summarization input can have words unseen in the background</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Surprise is computed based on the changes in probabilities of all of these hypotheses upon seeing the summarization input ii) The computation of topic words is local, it assumes</a>
