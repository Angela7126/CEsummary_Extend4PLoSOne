<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Group I contains our evaluation metrics, DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that the Asiya metrics are combinations of several metrics, and these combinations (which exclude DR and DR- lex ) can be also tuned; this yields sizable improvements over the untuned versions as column three in the table shows</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Below we present the evaluation results at the system- and segment-level, using our two basic metrics on discourse trees (Section 3.1 ), which are referred to as DR and DR- lex</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We can see that the tuned combinations with DR- lex improve over most of the individual metrics in groups II and III</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding DR and DR- lex to the combinations manages to improve over five and four of the six tuned Asiya metrics, respectively</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Furthermore, we also present overall results for i ) the average score over all metrics, excluding DR and DR- lex , and ( ii ) the differences in the correlations for the DR/DR- lex -combined and the original metrics</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>On the contrary, DR and DR- lex significantly improve over NIST, Rouge , TER, and BLEU</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For each metric in groups II, III and IV, we present the results for the original metric as well for the linear interpolation of that metric with DR and with DR- lex</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The combinations with DR and DR- lex that improve over the original metrics are shown in bold , and those that degrade are in italic</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Compared to this baseline, DR improves for three of the six Asiya metrics, while DR- lex improves for four of them</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In this section, we explore how discourse information can be used to improve machine translation</a>
