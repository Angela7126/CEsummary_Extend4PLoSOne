aVWe then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4
p2
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of the clustering
p3
aVThus, descriptions from both Summa and flat MDS generally covered the most salient information
p4
