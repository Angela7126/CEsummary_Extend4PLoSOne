VWe propose to improve upon the correction detection component by training a classifier that determines which edits in a revised sentence address the same error in the original sentence
p1
aVAlso, as suggested by the experimental result, among the four corpora, FCE corpus is a comparably good resource for training correction detection models with our current feature set
p2
aVIf the resulting basic edits do not match with those that compose the actual corrections, we attribute the error to the first step

aVThe models built on corpora can generally improve the correction detection accuracy 5 5 We currently
