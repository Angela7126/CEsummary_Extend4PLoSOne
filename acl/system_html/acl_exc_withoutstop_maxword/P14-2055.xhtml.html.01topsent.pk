VInput + background
p1
aVThe TS sum system selects sentences with greater counts of topic words and TS avg computes the number of topic words normalized by sentence length
p2
aVCentral to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u005cu2019' s topic
p3
aVThese systems combine (i) a score based on the background ( KL back , TS or SR ) with (ii) the score based on the input only ( KL inp
p4
aVIn fact, the surprise methods have numerically higher ROUGE-1 scores compared to input similarity ( KL inp ) in contrast to generic summarization
p5
aVFor example, to combine TS sum and KL inp for each sentence, we compute its scores based on the two methods
p6
aVWe use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization
