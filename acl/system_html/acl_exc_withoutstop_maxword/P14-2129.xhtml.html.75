<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Space constraints preclude inclusion of trials with this method, but the net result is a severe degradation in accuracy (tens of points of F-measure) versus standard parsing</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that segmentation time is negligible compared to the parsing time, hence is omitted in reported time</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After applying such a transform to a treebank, we can induce grammars and modify parsing to search as needed to recover just these constituents</a>
