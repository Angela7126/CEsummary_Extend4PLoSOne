<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Example ( 1 ), where u'\u27e8' u'\u27e9' marks the cue and { } the in-scope elements, illustrates the annotations, including how negation inside a noun phrase can scope over discontinuous parts of the sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Furthermore, even a system using syntactic structure to model scope would be faced with a more complicated task than our crawling rules</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We evaluated the performance of our system using the Shared Task development and evaluation data (respectively CDD and CDE in Table 1</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus, we also tested fall-back configurations which use scope predictions based on MRS in some cases, and scope predictions from the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 in others</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In comparison, the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 accomplishes 119 exact scope matches, of which 80 are shared with Crawler; in other words, there are 14 cue instances (or 8% of all cues) in which our approach can improve over the best-performing syntax-based submission to the original Shared Task</a>
