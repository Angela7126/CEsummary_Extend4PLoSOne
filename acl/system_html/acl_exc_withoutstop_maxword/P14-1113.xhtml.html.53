<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We observe that the same property also applies to some hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
