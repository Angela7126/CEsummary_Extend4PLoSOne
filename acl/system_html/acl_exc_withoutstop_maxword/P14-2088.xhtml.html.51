<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For each feature template, there are thousands of binary features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Then we present three versions of marginalized denoising autoencoders (mDA) by incorporating different types of noise, including two new noising processes that are designed for structured features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In structural correspondence learning (SCL), the induced representation is based on the task of predicting the presence of pivot features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>While the marginalized denoising autoencoder (mDA) is considerably faster than the original denoising autoencoder, it requires solving a system of equations that can grow very large, as realistic NLP tasks can involve 10 5 or more features</a>
