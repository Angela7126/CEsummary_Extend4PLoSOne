<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models, and the gain achieved by the semantic reordering models is limited in the presence of the MR08 syntactic features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It shows that 1) as expected, our classifiers do worse on the harder semantic reordering prediction than syntactic reordering prediction; 2) thanks to the high accuracy obtained by the maxent classifiers, integrating either the syntactic or the semantic reordering constraints results in better reordering performance from both syntactic and semantic perspectives; 3) in terms of the mutual impact, the syntactic reordering models help improving semantic reordering more than the semantic reordering models help improving syntactic reordering; and 4) the rightmost models have a learnability advantage over the leftmost models, achieving higher accuracy across the board</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The reordering type distribution on the reordering model training data in Table 3 suggests that semantic reordering is more difficult than syntactic reordering</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To show the effectiveness of our reordering models, we integrate both syntactic constituent reordering models and semantic role reordering models into a state-of-the-art HPB system [ 4 , 7 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The syntactic reordering models outperform the semantic reordering models on both the baseline and MR08 systems</a>
