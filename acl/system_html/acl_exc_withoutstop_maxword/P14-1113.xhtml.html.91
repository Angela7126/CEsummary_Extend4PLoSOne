<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Furthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The combination strategy is to simply merge all positive results from the two methods together, and then to infer new relations based on the transitivity of hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>2009 ) propose a method based on patterns to find hypernyms on arbitrary noun phrases</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Several other methods are based on lexical patterns</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relations and its reverse (hyponym u'\u2013' hypernym) have one-to-one correspondence, their performances are equal</a>
