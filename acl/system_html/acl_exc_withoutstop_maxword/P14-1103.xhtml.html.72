<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We consider this question by examining the dominant framework in modern phonology, Optimality Theory [, OT] , implemented in a log-linear framework, MaxEnt OT [] , with output forms u'\u2019' probabilities based on a weighted sum of constraint violations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a new approach to learn constraints with limited innate phonological knowledge by identifying sets of constraint violations that explain the observed distributional data, instead of selecting constraints from an innate set of constraint definitions</a>
