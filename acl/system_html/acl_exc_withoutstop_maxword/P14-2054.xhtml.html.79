<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are two rules for merging spans one merges two complete spans into an incomplete span, the other merges an incomplete span and a complete span into a large complete span</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A span is a subtree over a number of consecutive words, with the leftmost or the rightmost word as its root</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Suppose x j is removed, there must be a virtual arc j - 1 u'\u2192' j which is a conflict with the fact that x j is the leftmost word</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Case 4 Merge an incomplete span and a complete span</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Case 3 Merge an incomplete span and a complete span</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The two complete spans must be single words, as the length of the virtual arc is 1</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For any compressed sentence, we could augment its dependency tree by adding a virtual arc i - 1 u'\u2192' i for each deleted word x i</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The incomplete span is covered by a virtual arc</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Case 4 u'\u2019' Merge an incomplete span and a complete span</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We can reversely get the the compressed parse tree by removing all virtual</a>
