VTo sum up, Inst features are essential for classifying multi-label verbs, and the LingInd features provide some useful prior
p1
aVUsing the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the feature Lemma
p2
aVIn addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types
p3
aVFor multi-label verbs, the feature combination Lemma+LingInd+Inst leads to significant 5 improvement of 2% gain in accuracy over the baseline; Table 9 reports detailed class statistics and reveals a gain in F-measure of 3 points over the baseline
p4
aVFor verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that
p5
aVNo feature combination significantly 4 4 According to McNemar u'\u005cu2019' s test with Yates u'\u005cu2019' correction for continuity, p 0.01 outperforms the baseline of simply memorizing the most frequent class of a verb type in the respective training folds
p6
aVTherefore we propose handling ambiguous verbs separately
