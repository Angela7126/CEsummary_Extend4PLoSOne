VWe then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4

aVMoreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary
p2
aVA hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary
p3
aVA hierarchical clustering is a tree in which if a cluster g p is the parent of cluster g c , then each sentence in g c is also in g p
p4
aVIn hierarchical summarization, however, a cluster summary may span hundreds of documents and a wide range of information
p5
aVA user can navigate within the hierarchical summary by clicking on an element of a parent summary to view the associated child summary
p6
aVThe hierarchical summary follows the hierarchical structure of
