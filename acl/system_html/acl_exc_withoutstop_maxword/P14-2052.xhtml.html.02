<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We experimentally evaluated the test collection for single document summarization contained in the RST Discourse Treebank (RST-DTB) [ 4 ] distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) 1 1 http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/CatalogEntry.jsp catalogId=LDC2002T07</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Extractive summarization is one well-known approach to text summarization and extractive methods represent a document (or a set of documents) as a set of some textual units (e.g.,, sentences, clauses, and words) and select their subset as a summary</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Equation ( 14 ) means that the sequence of words has to be selected together, i.e.,, a proper noun sequence whose POS tag is PRP$, WP%, or POS and a possessive word and its parent word and the words between them</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The RST-DTB Corpus includes 385 Wall Street Journal articles with RST annotations, and 30 of these documents also have one manually prepared reference summary</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, the models have tended to select small fragments from many sentences to maximize objective functions and have led to fragmented summaries being generated</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We propose a method of summarizing a single document that utilizes dependency between sentences obtained from rhetorical structures and dependency between words obtained from a dependency parser</a>
