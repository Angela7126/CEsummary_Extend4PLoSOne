<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Users navigate the hierarchical summary from parent sentence to child summary, so if the parent sentence bears no relation to the child summary, the user will be understandably confused</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We then describe our methodology to implement the Summa hierarchical summarization system hierarchical clustering in Section 3 and creating summaries based on that clustering in Section 4</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, a hierarchical summary must also have intra-cluster coherence and parent-to-child coherence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A hierarchical summary that is only salient and nonredundant may still not be suitable if the sentences within a cluster summary are disconnected or if the parent sentence for a summary does not relate to the child summary</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Moreover, the number of sentences in a flat summary is exactly equal to the number of child clusters of the node, since the user will click a sentence to get to the child summary</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The problem of hierarchical summarization as described in Section 2 has all of the requirements of MDS, and additional complexities of inducing a hierarchical structure, processing an order of magnitude</a>
