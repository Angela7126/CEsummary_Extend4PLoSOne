VDifferent from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences
p1
aVFirst, noise in unlabeled data is largely alleviated, since parse forest encodes only a few highly possible parse trees with high oracle score
p2
aVBoth work employs two parsers to process the unlabeled data, and only select as extra training data sentences on which the 1-best parse trees of the two parsers are identical
p3
aVTherefore, exploiting such unlabeled data may introduce more discriminative syntactic knowledge, largely compensating labeled training data
p4
aV16K for Chinese), it is likely that the unlabeled data may overwhelm the labeled data during SGD training
p5
aVUsing three supervised parsers, we have many options to construct parse forest on unlabeled data
p6
aVTo construct parse forest on unlabeled data, we employ three supervised parsers based on different paradigms, including our baseline graph-based dependency parser, a transition-based dependency parser [] , and a generative constituent parser []
p7
aVEspecially, the unlabeled data with highly divergent structures leads to slightly higher improvement
p8
aVWe divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar
p9
aVFinally, using a conditional random field (CRF) based probabilistic parser, we train a better model by maximizing mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings

aVTraining with the combined labeled and unlabeled data, the objective is
