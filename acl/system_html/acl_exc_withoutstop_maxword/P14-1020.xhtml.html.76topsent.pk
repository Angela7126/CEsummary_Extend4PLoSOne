VMBR algorithms for parsing do not compute the best derivation, as in Viterbi parsing, but instead the parse tree that maximizes the expected count of some figure of merit
p1
aVBecause the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass
p2
aVThus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u005cu2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u005cu2019' s scores
p3
aVFigure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely
p4
aVWe tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass
p5
aVBecause we are summing instead of maxing scores in the fine pass, the scaling factors computed using max scores are not quite large enough, and so the rescaled inside probabilities grow too large when multiplied together
p6
aVTheir system uses a grammar based on the Berkeley parser [ 9 ] (which is particularly amenable to GPU processing), u'\u005cu201c' compiling u'\u005cu201d' the grammar into a sequence of
