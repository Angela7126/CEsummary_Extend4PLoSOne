aV2013 ) presented a QA system that maps questions onto simple queries against Open IE extractions, by learning paraphrases from a large monolingual parallel corpus, and performing a single paraphrasing step

aVWe use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance
