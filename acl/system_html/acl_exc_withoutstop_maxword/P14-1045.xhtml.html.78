<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We tested the two strategies, by applying the classical Smote method of [] as a kind of resampling, and the ensemble method MetaCost of [] as a cost-aware learning method</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a baseline, we can also consider a simple threshold on the lexical similarity score, in our case Lin u'\u2019' s measure, which we have shown to yield the best F-score of 24% when set at 0.22</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This can be considered as a baseline for extraction of relevant lexical pairs, to which we turn in the following section</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Intrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects []</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus there is no need for a syntactic analysis of the context considered when exploiting the resource, and sparsity is less of an issue 1 1 Whenever two predicates with the same lemma have common neighbours, we average the score of the pairs</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An important aspect is thus to guarantee that there is a correlation between the similarity score (Lin u'\u2019' s score here), and the evaluated</a>
