<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Note that some event causality candidates were not given excitation values for their templates, since some templates were acquired by manual annotation without Hashimoto et al u'\u2019' s method</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the test data , we randomly sampled 23,650 examples of u'\u27e8' event causality candidate, original sentence u'\u27e9' among which 3,645 were positive from 2,451,254 event causality candidates extracted from our web corpus (Section 3.1</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We require that event causality be self-contained , i.e.,, intelligible as causality without the sentences from which it was extracted</a>
