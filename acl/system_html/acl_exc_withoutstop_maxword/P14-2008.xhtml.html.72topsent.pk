VThe lack of consensus on the most useful citation polarity features coupled with the recent success of deep learning neural networks [ 10 ] further motivate our choice to limit our features to the n -grams available in the product review or citation context and not rely on external resources or tools for additional features

aVAthar ( 2011 ) on the other hand reported significant improvement using dependency relation features and found that the same list of polar words slightly hurt classification accuracy

aVOur approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features
p3
aVPrevious work in citation polarity classification focuses on finding new citation features to improve classification, borrowing a few from text classification in general (e.g.,, n -grams), and perhaps others from sentiment
