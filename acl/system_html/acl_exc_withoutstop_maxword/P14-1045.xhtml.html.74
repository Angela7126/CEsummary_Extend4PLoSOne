<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The method we propose here has been designed as an intrinsic evaluation with a view to validate semantic proximity links in a broad perspective, to cover what [] call u'\u201c' non classical lexical semantic relations u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>They are not suitable for the evaluation of the whole range of semantic relatedness that is exhibited by distributional similarities, which exceeds the limits of classical lexical relations, even though researchers have tried to collect equivalent resources manually, to be used as a gold standard []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>the ranks of tokens in other related items neighbours r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' k a - b is defined as the rank of neighbour a among neighbours of neighbour b u'\u2009' ordered with respect to Lin u'\u2019' s score; r u'\u2062' a u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' g b - a is defined similarly and again we consider as features the min, max and log-product of these ranks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Intrinsic evaluations try to measure the resource itself with respect to some human standard or judgment, for instance by comparing a distributional resource with respect to an existing synonym dictionary or similarity judgment produced by human subjects []</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One advantage of distributional similarities is to exhibit a lot of different semantic relations, not necessarily standard lexical relations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We differ from all these evaluation procedures as we do not focus on an essential view of the relatedness of two lexical items, but evaluate the link in a context where the relevance of the link is in question, an u'\u201c' existential u'\u201d' view of semantic relatedness</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>each neighbour productivity p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d a and p u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' o u'\u2062' d b are defined as the numbers of neighbours of respectively neighbour a and neighbour b in the database (thus related tokens</a>
