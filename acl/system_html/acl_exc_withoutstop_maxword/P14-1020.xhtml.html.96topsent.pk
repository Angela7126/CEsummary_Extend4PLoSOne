VMBR algorithms for parsing do not compute the best derivation, as in Viterbi parsing, but instead the parse tree that maximizes the expected count of some figure of merit
p1
aVBecause the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass
p2
aVThus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u005cu2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u005cu2019' s scores
p3
aVFigure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely
p4
aVBecause we are summing instead of maxing scores in the fine pass, the scaling factors computed using max scores are not quite large enough, and so the rescaled inside probabilities grow too large when multiplied together
p5
aVThe coarse to fine pruning approach of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) employs an X-bar grammar as its first pruning phase, but there is no reason why we cannot begin with a more complex grammar for our initial pass
p6
aVTherefore, in the
