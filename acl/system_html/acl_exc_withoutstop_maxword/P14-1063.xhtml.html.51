<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A linear tensor model represents both features and weights in tensor-space, hence the weight tensor can be factorized and approximated by a linear sum of rank-1 tensors</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This also makes training the model parameters a challenging problem, since the amount of labeled training data is usually small compared to the size of feature sets the feature weights cannot be estimated reliably</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Most traditional models are linear models, in the sense that both the features of the data and model parameters are represented as vectors in a vector space</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Such models require learning individual feature weights directly, so that the number of parameters to be estimated is identical to the size of the feature set</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The linear tensor model is illustrated in Figure 1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As mentioned in Section 2.1 , a tensor model has many more degrees of u'\u201c' design freedom u'\u201d' than a vector model, which makes the problem of finding a good tensor structure a nontrivial one</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>So what is the advantage of learning with a tensor model instead of a vector model</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Specifically, a vector space model assumes each feature weight to be a u'\u201c' free u'\u201d' parameter, and estimating them reliably could therefore be hard when training data are not sufficient or the feature set is huge</a>
