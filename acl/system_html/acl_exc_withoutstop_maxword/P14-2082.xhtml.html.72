<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast, we aim for a shift in the community wherein all pairs are considered candidates for temporal ordering, allowing researchers to ask questions such as how must algorithms adapt to label the complete graph of pairs, and if the more difficult and ambiguous event pairs are included, how must feature-based learners change</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We lean toward higher annotator agreement with relations that have greater separation between their semantics 4 4 For instance, a relation like starts is a special case of includes if events are viewed as open intervals, and immediately before is a special case of before</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Learning algorithms handle these unlabeled edges by making incorrect assumptions, or by ignoring large parts of the temporal graph</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This paper thus proposes an annotation process that builds denser graphs with formal properties that learners can rely</a>
