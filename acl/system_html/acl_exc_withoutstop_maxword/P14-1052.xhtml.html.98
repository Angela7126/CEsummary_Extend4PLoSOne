<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>SPUD [ 18 ] , a system for NLG through microplanning, considers NLG as a problem which requires realizing a deliberative process of goal-directed activity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the second step, the target subtree is removed from the sentence tree, and placed in the auxiliary tree as a direct replacement for the foot node</a>
