<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The problem we face here can be considered as a special case of domain adaptation , where we have access to labelled data on the source domain (PTB) and unlabelled data on the target domain (web data</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which</a>
