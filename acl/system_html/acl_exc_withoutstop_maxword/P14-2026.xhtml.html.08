<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, we converted the constituent parse trees in the results of the Berkeley Parser into dependency parse trees by employing a tool in the Stanford Parser [ 2003 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Stanford typed dependency parse tree for the same Chinese sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The evaluation set contained 200 sentences randomly selected from the development set</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In contrast, we propose a set of pre-ordering rules for dependency parsers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In our opinion, the reason for the great decrease was that the dependency parse trees were more concise than the constituent parse trees in describing sentences and they could also describe the reordering at the sentence level in a finer way</a>
