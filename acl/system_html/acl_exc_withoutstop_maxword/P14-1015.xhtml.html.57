<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since the language and translation models operate at the word level, the objective function entails that we let the models learn based on their fractional contribution of the words from the language and translation models</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The IBM Model 1 learning process uses an internal EM approach where the E-step estimates the alignment vector for each problem word; this vector indicates the distribution of alignments of the problem word across the solution words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>All solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We let each reply word contribute as much to the respective language and translation models according to the estimates in Section 4.3.2</a>
