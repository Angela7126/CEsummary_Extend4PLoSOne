<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Note, question decomposition only operates on the original question and question spans covered by complete dependency subtrees</a>
