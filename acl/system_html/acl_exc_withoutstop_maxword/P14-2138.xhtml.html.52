<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The authors propose the following hypothesis to explain this finding u'\u201c' the choice of words [emphasis added] people make when writing in a second language is strongly influenced by the phonology of their native language u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We follow the setup of Tsur and Rappoport ( 2007 ) by extracting two sets, denoted I1 and I2 (Table 1 ), from the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE), Version 2 [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the orthography of alphabetic languages is at least partially representative of the underlying phonology, character bigrams may capture these phonological preferences</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The words that are identified as the most discriminative include function words, punctuation, very common content words, and the toponymic terms</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, if we train the classifier using words as features, with values representing their frequency relative to the length of the document, the features corresponding to the word China might receive the following weights</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We propose to quantify the importance of each word by converting its SVM feature weights into a single score using the following formula</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We conclude that character bigrams are effective in determining L1 of the author because they reflect differences in L2 word usage that are unrelated to the phonology of L1</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The classifier computes a weight for each feature coupled with each L1 language by attempting to maximize the overall accuracy on the training set</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, we limit the set of features to the 200</a>
