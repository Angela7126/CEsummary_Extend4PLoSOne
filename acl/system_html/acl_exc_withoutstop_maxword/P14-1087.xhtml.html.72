<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>SWING is a supervised, extractive summarization system which ranks sentences based on scores computed using a set of features in the Sentence Scoring phase</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>From the resulting weakly-connected graph, the largest forests are assumed to contain key topics within the document set and used to influence a scoring mechanism which prefers sentences touching on these topics</a>
