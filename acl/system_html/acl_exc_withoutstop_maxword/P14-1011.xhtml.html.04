<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given a phrase pair ( s , t ) , the BRAE model first obtains their semantic phrase representations ( p s , p t ) , and then transforms p s into target semantic space p s * , p t into source semantic space p t *</a>
