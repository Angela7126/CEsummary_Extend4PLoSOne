<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The bilingual lexicon extraction task from bilingual corpora was initially addressed by using parallel corpora (i.e., a corpus that contains source texts and their translation</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to Fung and Cheung (2004) , who range bilingual corpora from parallel corpora to quasi-comparable corpora going through comparable corpora, there is a continuum from parallel to comparable corpora (i.e., a kind of filiation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We then conducted a second experiment where we varied the size of the English part of the comparable corpus, from 530,000 to 7.4 million words for the breast cancer corpus in 530,000 words steps, and from 250,000 to 3.5 million words for the diabetes corpus in 250,000 words steps (we refer to these corpora as unbalanced</a>
