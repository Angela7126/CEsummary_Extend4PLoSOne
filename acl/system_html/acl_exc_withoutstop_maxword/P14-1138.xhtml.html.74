<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the proposed model can find alignments by taking advantage of the long alignment history, while the FFNN-based model considers only the last alignment</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Viterbi alignment is determined using the Viterbi algorithm, similar to the FFNN-based model, where the model is sequentially applied from f 1 to f J 5 5 Strictly speaking, we cannot apply the dynamic programming forward-backward algorithm (i.e.,, the Viterbi algorithm) due to the long alignment history of y i</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Figure 3 (a) shows that R u'\u2062' R u'\u2062' N s adequately identifies complicated alignments with long distances compared to F u'\u2062' F u'\u2062' N u'\u2062' N s (e.g.,, jaggy alignments of u'\u201c' have you been learning u'\u201d' in Fig 3 (a)) because R u'\u2062' N u'\u2062' N s captures alignment paths based on long alignment history, which can be viewed as phrase-level alignments, while F u'\u2062' F u'\u2062' N u'\u2062' N s employs only the last alignment</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Note that alignments in the FFNN-based model are also governed by first-order Markov dynamics because an alignment score depends on the previous alignment a j - 1</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The alignment model based on an FFNN is formed in the same manner as the lexical translation model</a>
