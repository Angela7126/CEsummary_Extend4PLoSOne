<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since the context vectors are computed from each part of the comparable corpus rather than through the parts of the comparable corpora, the standard approach is relatively insensitive to differences in corpus sizes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We then apply the resulting regression function to each word co-occurrence count as a pre-processing step of the standard approach</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The main work in bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora is based on lexical context analysis and relies on the simple observation that a word and its translation tend to appear in the same lexical contexts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We chose the balanced corpora where the standard approach has shown the best results in the previous experiment, namely [ breast cancer corpus 12 ] and [ diabetes corpus 7 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Within this context, our main contribution consists in a re-reading of the standard approach putting emphasis on the unfounded assumption of the balance of the specialized comparable corpora</a>
