VSince each visit can be associated with multiple medical records, the relevance of a visit is related to the relevance of individual associated medical records
p1
aVExisting studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5 , 15 ] , or record-level, where we can first compute the relevance score of individual records and then aggregate their scores as the relevance score of a visit [ 15 , 30 , 12 ]
p2
aVIn the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants
p3
aVTo fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect
p4
aVHowever, when converting the text to concepts representation using MetaMap, the occurrences of the concepts are determined by not only the original term occurrences, a good indicator of relevance, but also the number of mapped concepts, which is determined by MetaMap and has nothing to do with the relevance status
p5
aVThus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants
p6
aVThus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts
p7
aVIn particular, given a patient u'\u005cu2019' s visit, all the medical records generated from this visit are merged
