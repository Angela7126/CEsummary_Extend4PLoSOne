<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Non-video Game with a Purpose To measure the impact of the video game itself on the annotation process, we developed a non-video game with a purpose, referred to as SuchGame</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>SuchGame was promoted with same free recognition incentive as Infection and TKT</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For images, crowdsourcing workers have a higher IAA than game players; however, this increased agreement is due to adversarial workers consistently selecting the same, incorrect answer</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While their game is among the most video game-like, the annotation task is a chore the player must perform in order to return to the game, rather than an integrated, fun part of the game u'\u2019' s objectives, which potentially decreases motivation for answering correctly</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This bias leads to annotations with few false positives, but as Column 5 shows, crowdflower workers consistently performed much worse than game players at identifying valid relations, producing many false negative annotations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Third, we note that both video games in the paid setting incur a fixed cost (for the prizes) and therefore additional games played can only further decrease the cost per annotation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We refer to these as the paid and free versions of the game, respectively</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For each task we developed a video game with a purpose that integrates the task within the game, as illustrated in Sections 4 and 5</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Based on agreement</a>
