<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Convert accepted path alignments into statements on abstract denotations, use them in logical inference as new knowledge, and try to prove H again</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Based on abstract denotations, we briefly describe our process to apply DCS to textual inference</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this section we describe the idea of representing natural language semantics by DCS trees, and achieving inference by computing logical relations among the corresponding abstract denotations</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As the semantics of DCS trees is formulated by abstract denotations, the meanings of declarative sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Perform rule-based conversion from dependency parses to DCS trees, which are translated to statements on abstract denotations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The strict semantics of DCS trees brings us the idea of applying DCS to logical inference</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since meanings of sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations, logical inference among sentences is reduced to deriving new relations among abstract denotations</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Accepted aligned paths are converted into statements, which are used as new knowledge</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We built an inference engine to perform logical inference on abstract denotations as above</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Abstract denotations and statements are convenient for representing semantics of various types of expressions and linguistic knowledge</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Furthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by transformed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are preserved in Figure 6 , though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule u'\u201c' X is blamed for death u'\u2192' X causes loss of life u'\u201d' , the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Most of the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system without on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal semantics</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>To formulate the database querying process defined by a DCS tree, we provide formal semantics to DCS trees by employing relational algebra [] for representing the query</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Aligned paths are evaluated by a similarity score, for which we use distributional similarity of the words that appear in the paths ( 4.1</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If H is not proven, compare DCS trees of T and H , and generate path alignments</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Only path alignments with high similarity scores can be accepted</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>We extract fragments of DCS trees as paraphrase candidates, translate them back to linguistic expressions, and apply distributional similarity to judge their validity</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>An inference engine is built to handle inference on abstract denotations</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Two paths are aligned if the joined germs are aligned, and we impose constraints on aligned germs to inhibit meaningless alignments, as described below</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>DCS trees has been proposed to represent natural language semantics with a structure similar to dependency trees [] (Figure 1</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For example, to apply the aligned path pair generated in Figure 5 , we use it to transform T into a new tree T u'\u2019' (Figure 6 ), and then the aligned germs, OBJ ( blame ) in T and SUBJ ( cause ) in T u'\u2019' , will generate the on-the-fly knowledge</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>A path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Use statements of T and linguistic knowledge as premises, and try to prove statements of H by our inference engine</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Technically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values [] of that variable</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Path alignments with scores higher than a threshold are accepted</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>This formulation keeps the simpleness and computability of DCS trees mostly unaffected; for example, our semantic calculation for DCS trees is parallel to the denotation computation in original DCS</a>
