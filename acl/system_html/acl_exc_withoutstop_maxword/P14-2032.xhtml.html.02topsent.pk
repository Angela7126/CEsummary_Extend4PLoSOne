V\u005cnewcite Sun:2010:COLING details their respective theoretical strengths character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new oov words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans

aVChinese text is written without delimiters between words; as a result, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is an essential foundational step for many tasks in Chinese natural language processing
p2
aVPrior work has shown performance gains from combining these two types of models to exploit their respective strengths, but such approaches are often complex to implement and computationally expensive
p3
aVDD has been successfully applied to similar situations for combining local with global models; for example, in dependency parsing [ 9 ] , bilingual sequence tagging [ 21 ]
