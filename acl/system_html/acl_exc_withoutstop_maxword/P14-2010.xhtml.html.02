<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In supervised text classification learning algorithms, the learner (a program) takes human labeled documents as input and learns a decision function that can classify a previously unseen document to one of the predefined classes</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Chakraborti et al., 2007) empirically show that sprinkled words boost higher order word associations and projects documents with same class labels close to each other in latent semantic space</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>LDA is an unsupervised probabilistic topic model and it is widely used to discover latent semantic structure of a document collection by modeling words in the documents</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is then performed on the sprinkled training documents and a lower rank approximation is constructed by ignoring dimensions corresponding to lower singular values</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As LDA uses higher order word associations [] while discovering topics, we hypothesize that sprinkling will improve text classification performance of ClassifyLDA</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We modify collapsed Gibbs sampling update in Equation 1 to carry class label information while inferring topics</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents</a>
