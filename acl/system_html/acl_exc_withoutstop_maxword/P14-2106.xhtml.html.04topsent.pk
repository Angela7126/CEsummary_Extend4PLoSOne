VLater, successfully introduced WordNet classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full PTB using gold POS tags, trying different combinations of semantic classes investigate the addition of semantic annotations in the form of word sense hypernyms, in HPSG parse ranking, reducing error rate in dependency F-score by 1%, while some methods produce substantial decreases in performance showed that fully disambiguated sense-based features smoothed using ontological information are effective for parse selection

aVWe will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags
p2
aVBroadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems
