<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Entity types and subtypes are employed as semantic pair</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In order to give a better comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, based on our experiment settings and data, we implement the two feature based methods proposed by Che et al</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>[] also pointed out that, due to the inaccuracy of Chinese word segmentation and parsing, the tree kernel based approach is inappropriate for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Those are generated by combining two entity types or two entity subtypes into a semantic pair</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To use the Omni-word feature, we segment each relation mention by two entity mentions</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To sum up, among the five candidate feature sets, the position feature is used as a singleton feature</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Semantic pair is generated by combining two semantic units</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Head noun and adjacent entity POS tag are employed to combine with positional information</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Unlike the traditional segmentation based method, which is a partition of the sentence, the Omni-word feature uses every potential word in a sentence as lexicon feature</a>
