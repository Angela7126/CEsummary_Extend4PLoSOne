V2013 ) use co-occurring statistics among relations or events to jointly improve information extraction performances in ACE tasks, while we mine existing KBs to collect global clues to solve local conflicts and find the optimal aggregation assignments, regarding existing knowledge facts de Lacalle and Lapata ( 2013 ) encode general domain knowledge as FOL rules in a topic model while our instantiated constraints are directly operated in an ILP model
p1
aVSpecifically, the joint inference framework operates on the output of a sentence level relation extractor as input, derives 5 types of constraints from an existing KB to implicitly capture the expected type and cardinality requirements for a relation u'\u005cu2019' s arguments, and jointly resolve the disagreements among candidate predictions
p2
aVIn contrast, our approach learn implicit clues from existing KBs, and jointly optimize local predictions among different entity tuples to capture both relation argument type clues and cardinality clues
p3
aVAs discussed earlier, we will exploit from the knowledge base two categories of clues that implicitly capture relations u'\u005cu2019' backgrounds their expected argument types and argument cardinalities, based on which we can discover two
