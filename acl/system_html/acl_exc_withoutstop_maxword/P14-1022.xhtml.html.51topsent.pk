VSubsequent lines in Table 1 indicate additional surface feature templates computed over the span, which are then conjoined with the rule identity as shown in Figure 1 to give additional features
p1
aVOur base model has no surface features formally, on each anchored rule r we have only an indicator of the (unanchored) rule identity, rule u'\u005cu2062' ( r
p2
aVThe u'\u005cu201c' Replaced u'\u005cu201d' system modifies the Berkeley parser by replacing rare words with morphological descriptors of those words computed using language-specific modules, which have been hand-crafted for individual languages or are trained with additional annotation layers in the treebanks that we do not exploit
p3
aVAdding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser u'\u005cu2019' s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1
p4
aVAs illustrated in Figure 1 , the actual features of the model are obtained by conjoining surface properties with various abstractions of the rule identity
p5
aVOur parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects
