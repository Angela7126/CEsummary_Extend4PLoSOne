<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To estimate the utterance score, we view both the query terms and the signature terms as the terms that should appear in a human query-based summary</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this way, the title of each summary can be counted as a phrasal query and the corresponding summary is considered as the query-based abstract of the associated chat log including only the information most relevant to the title</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Query focus to identify the summary sentence with the highest coverage of query content, we propose a score that counts the number of query terms that appear in the path</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We also ask the evaluators to select the best summary for each query and conversation, given our system generated summary and the two baselines</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In order to identify such terms, we first extract all content terms from the query</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Considering the fact that the abstract sentences are automatically generated and the original sentences are human-written, the grammaticality score and the percentage of fully grammatical sentences generated by our system, with higher ROUGE or quality scores in comparison with other methods, demonstrates that our system is an effective phrasal query abstraction framework for both spoken and written conversations</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The absolute improvement of 10% in precision for ROUGE-1 in our abstractive model over our extractive model (our pipeline) further confirms the effectiveness of our ranking method in generating the abstract sentences considering the query related information</a>
