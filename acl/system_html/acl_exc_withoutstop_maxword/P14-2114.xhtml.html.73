<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Events extracted in our proposed framework are represented as a 4-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , l , k u'\u27e9' , where y stands for a non-location named entity, d for a date, l for a location, and k for an event-related keyword</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We thus propose a Latent Event Model (LEM) which can automatically detect events from social media without the use of labeled data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, named entities mentioned in tweets are likely to appear in news articles as well</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction</a>
