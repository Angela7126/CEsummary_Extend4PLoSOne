VAn edit-turn-pair is defined as a pair of an edit from a Wikipedia article u'\u005cu2019' s revision history and a turn from the discussion page bound to the same article
p1
aVThe search space for corresponding edit-turn-pairs is quite big, as any edit to an article may correspond to any turn from the article u'\u005cu2019' s discussion page
p2
aVTo assess the reliability of these annotations, one of the co-authors manually annotated a random subset of 100 edit-turn-pairs contained in ETP-gold as corresponding or non-corresponding
p3
aVHowever, given the high price for a new corresponding edit-turn-pair (due to the high class imbalance in random data), we consider it as a useful starting point for research on edit-turn-pairs in Wikipedia
p4
aVHowever, we still expect a certain amount of non-corresponding edit-turn-pairs in this data, as the annotator judged the correspondence based on the entire revision and not the individual edit
p5
aVFrom ETP-all, a set of 262 edit-turn-pairs have been annotated as corresponding as part of a preliminary annotation study with one human annotator
