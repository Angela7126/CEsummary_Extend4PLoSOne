VTheir system uses a grammar based on the Berkeley parser [ 9 ] (which is particularly amenable to GPU processing), u'\u005cu201c' compiling u'\u005cu201d' the grammar into a sequence of GPU kernels that are applied densely to every item in the parse chart
p1
aVFigure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely
p2
aVBecause the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass
p3
aVThe coarse to fine pruning approach of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) employs an X-bar grammar as its first pruning phase, but there is no reason why we cannot begin with a more complex grammar for our initial pass
p4
aVAs expected, binary rules account for the vast majority of the time in the unpruned Viterbi case, but much less time in the pruned case, with the total time taken for binary rules in the coarse and fine passes taking about 1/5 of the time taken by binaries in the unpruned version
p5
aVFor instance, in a latent variable parser, the coarse grammar would have symbols like N u'\u005cu2062' P , V u'\u005cu2062' P , etc., and the fine pass would have refined symbols N u'\u005cu2062' P 0 , N u'\u005cu2062' P 1 , V u'\u005cu2062' P 4 , and so on
p6
aVThe result is a parsing speed of 185.5 sentences per second, as shown in Table 1 on the row labeled u'\u005cu2018' Reimpl u'\u005cu2019' with u'\u005cu2018' Empty, Coarse u'\u005cu2019' pruning
p7
aVBecause all threads execute all code paths that any thread takes, time can only be saved if an entire warp agrees to skip any particular branch
p8
aVThe resulting speed is 187.5 sentences per second, labeled in Table 1 as row labeled u'\u005cu2018' Reimpl u'\u005cu2019' with u'\u005cu2018' Labeled, Coarse u'\u005cu2019' pruning
p9
aVThis approach works because a low quality coarse grammar can still reliably be used to prune many symbols from the fine chart without loss of accuracy
p10
aVWe tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass
p11
aVBecause we are summing instead of maxing scores in the fine pass, the scaling factors computed using max scores are not quite large enough, and so the rescaled inside probabilities grow too large when multiplied together
p12
aVMBR algorithms for parsing do not compute the best derivation, as in Viterbi parsing, but instead the parse tree that maximizes the expected count of some figure of merit
p13
aVThus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u005cu2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u005cu2019' s scores
p14
aVTherefore, they inlined the iteration over the grammar directly into the GPU kernels (i.e., the code itself), which allows the compiler to more effectively use all of its registers
p15
aVWhen coarse symbols are extremely unlikely (and therefore have few corresponding rules), we merge their clusters to avoid the overhead of beginning work on clusters where little work has to be done
p16
aVUsing coarse pruning and log domain calculations, our system produces MBR trees at a rate of 130.4 sentences per second, a four-fold increase
p17
aVIt is worth pointing out that although 98% of labeled spans can be skipped due to X-bar pruning, we found that only about 79% of binary rule applications can be skipped, because the unpruned symbols tend to be the ones with a larger grammar footprint
p18
aVAll threads in a warp must execute the same instruction at every clock cycle if one thread takes a branch the others do not, then all threads in the warp must follow both code paths
p19
aVBecause of the overhead associated with transferring work items to GPU, using a very small grammar may not be an efficient use of the GPU u'\u005cu2019' s computational resources
p20
aVSpreading symbols across clusters may be inefficient if a parse item licenses a given symbol, we will have to enqueue that item to any queue that has the symbol in its signature, no matter how many other symbols are in that cluster
p21
aVWe call the set of coarse symbols for a partition (and therefore the corresponding labeled work queue) a signature
p22
aV3 3 Specifically, after clustering based on the coarse parent symbol, we merge all clusters with less than 300 rules in them into one large cluster
p23
aVThen, when applying rules in the fine pass, each fine inside score over a split span ( i , k , j ) is scaled to the appropriate s i , j I by multiplying the score by exp u'\u005cu2061' ( s i , k I + s k , j I - s i , j I ) , where s i , k I , s k , j I , s i , j I are the scaling factors for the left child, right child, and parent, respectively
p24
aVA good clustering will group rules together that use the same symbols, since this means fewer memory accesses to read and write scores for symbols
p25
aV4 4 One can instead interpret this approach as changing the scaling factors to s i , j I u'\u005cu2032' = s i , j I u'\u005cu22c5' u'\u005cu220f' i u'\u005cu2264' k j u'\u005cu2211' A inside u'\u005cu2062' ( A , k , k + 1 ) , where inside is the array of scores for the fine pass
p26
aVAt the top level, the CPU and GPU communicate via a work queue of parse items of the form ( s , i , k , j ) , where s is an identifier of a sentence, i is the start of a span, k is the split point, and j is the end point
p27
aVIn order to subcluster, we divde up rules among subclusters so that each subcluster has the same number of active parent symbols
p28
aVIf a span has a very high or very low score in the coarse pass, it typically has a similar score in the fine pass
p29
aVWe should expect this algorithm to be at least a factor of two slower the outside pass performs at least as much work as the inside pass
p30
aVBecause of the overhead associated with creating pruning masks and the further overhead of GPU communication, we found that this method did not actually produce any time savings at all
p31
aVTo begin, we can compute the number of seconds needed to parse 1000 sentences
p32
aVIn our GPU system, multiple scores in any given span are being updated at the same time, which makes this dynamic rescaling tricky and expensive, especially since inter-warp communication is fairly limited
p33
aVBecause parsing with these grammars is still quite fast, we tried using them as the coarse pass instead
p34
aVEach SM can process up to 48 different warps at a time it interleaves the execution of each warp, so that when one warp is stalled another warp can execute
p35
aVBecause all rules are applied to all parse items, all threads are executing the same sequence of instructions
p36
aVAs Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) have shown, intermediate-sized Berkeley grammars prune many more symbols than the X-bar system
p37
aVSecond, we are able to skip a parse item for an entire cluster if that item u'\u005cu2019' s pruning mask does not intersect the cluster u'\u005cu2019' s signature
p38
aVRegisters are many times faster than variables located in thread-local memory, which is actually the same speed as global memory
p39
aVBecause NLP models typically treat sentences independently, NLP problems have long been seen as u'\u005cu201c' embarrassingly parallel u'\u005cu201d' u'\u005cu2013' large corpora can be processed arbitrarily fast by simply sending different sentences to different machines
p40
aVIn this paper, we develop algorithms that can exploit sparsity on a GPU by adapting coarse-to-fine pruning to a GPU setting
p41
aVBecause so many labeled spans are pruned, we are able to skip many of the grammar clusters and thus avoid many of the expensive operations
p42
aVThat way, we are more likely to be able to skip a subcluster, since fewer distinct symbols need to be u'\u005cu201c' off u'\u005cu201d' for a parse item to be skipped in a given subcluster
p43
aVThroughput increases through parsing 10,000 sentences, and then levels off by the time it reaches 100,000 sentences
p44
aVHowever, they are slower to parse with in a CPU context, and so they begin with an X-bar grammar
p45
aVHowever, we would only avoid the work of applying the rule if all threads in the warp agreed to skip it
p46
aVThus sparsely skipping rules and symbols will not save any work
p47
aVThe X-bar grammar can compute pruning masks at just over 1000 sentences per second, the 1-split grammar parses 858 sentences per second, and the 2-split grammar parses 526 sentences per second
p48
aVThere is greater overhead in the scaling system, because scaling factors are copied to the CPU between the coarse and fine passes
p49
aVUsing scaling, we are able to push our parser to 190.6 sentences/second for MBR extraction, just under half the speed of the Viterbi system
p50
aVIt is of course important verify the correctness of our system; one easy way to do so is to examine parsing accuracy, as compared to the original Berkeley parser
p51
aVUsing this approach, we see gains of nearly 2.5x over the dense GPU implementation, resulting in overall speeds of up to 404 sentences per second
p52
aVThus, it makes sense to choose a clustering algorithm that exploits the structure introduced by the pruning masks
p53
aVFor instance, one might want to maximize the expected number of correct constituents [ 3 ] , or the expected rule counts [ 10 , 9 ]
p54
aVWe use a coarse-to-fine approach as in Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) , but with only one coarse pass
p55
aVIndeed, in practice the compiler will often hang if we use the same size grammar clusters as we did for Viterbi
p56
aVClustering using this method is labeled u'\u005cu2018' Parent u'\u005cu2019' in Table 1
p57
aVGPUs work by executing thousands of threads at once, but impose the constraint that large blocks of threads must be executing the same instructions in lockstep, differing only in their input data
p58
aVMoreover, it typically has worse memory access patterns, leading to slower performance
p59
aVFinally, when pruning, it is best if symbols that have the same coarse projection are clustered together
p60
aVBecause the Berkeley grammar is so large, the compiler is not able to efficiently schedule all of the operations in the grammar, resulting in register spills
p61
aVTherefore, in the fine pass, we normalize the inside scores at the leaves to sum to 1.0
p62
aVIn Table 4 , we break down the time taken by our system into individual components
p63
aVThis architecture environment puts very different constraints on parsing algorithms from a CPU environment
p64
aVClustering using this method is labeled u'\u005cu2018' Reimplementation u'\u005cu2019' in Table 1
p65
aVSince each thread in the warp is processing a different span (perhaps even from a different sentence), consensus from all 32 threads on any skip would be unlikely
p66
aVWhenever f becomes either too big or too small, the number is rescaled back to a less u'\u005cu201c' dangerous u'\u005cu201d' range by shifting mass from the exponent e to the scaling factor s
p67
aVBecause the grammars are compiled into code, the additional operations are all inlined into the kernels, producing much larger kernels
p68
aVBecause the entire partition (though not necessarily the entire grammar) is applied to each item in the queue, we still do not need to worry about warp divergence
p69
aVHow can we best cluster and subcluster the grammar so as to maximize performance
p70
aVFirst, classic single-core processors and main memory architectures are no longer getting substantially faster over time, so speed gains must now come from parallelism within a single machine
p71
aVSuch extreme speedups over a dense GPU baseline currently seem unlikely because fine-grained sparsity appears to be directly at odds with dense parallelism
p72
aVSince tasks like parsing boil down to repeated read-multiply-write loops, GPUs should be many times more efficient in time, power, or cost
p73
aV2 2 A thread can use more registers than this, but the full complement of 48 warps cannot execute if too many are used
p74
aVWe use seconds per sentence rather than sentences per second because the former measure is additive.) The results are in Table 3
p75
aVDuring parsing, we only enqueue items ( s , i , k , j ) to a labeled queue if two conditions are met
p76
aVAs usual, profiles exhibit an observer effect, where the act of measuring the system changes the execution
p77
aVIn coarse-to-fine inference, one applies the grammars in sequence, computing inside and outside scores
p78
aVThese timing numbers are computed using the built-in profiling capabilities of the programming environment
p79
aVAnother approach would be to skip enqueuing any parse item ( s , i , k , j ) where the pruning mask for any of ( i , j ) , ( i , k ) , or ( k , j ) is entirely empty (i.e., all symbols are pruned in this cell by the coarse grammar
p80
aVUnless otherwise noted, all experiments are conducted on sentences of length u'\u005cu2264' 40 words, and we estimate times based on batches of 20K sentences
p81
aVBecause registers are so much faster than thread-local memory, it is critical to keep as many variables in registers as possible
p82
aVThe GPU takes large numbers of parse items and applies the entire grammar to them in parallel
p83
aVThe natural implementation would be for each thread to check if each rule is licensed before applying it
p84
aVNevertheless, the general trends should more or less be preserved as compared to the unprofiled code
p85
aVOne way to accomplish this is to unroll loops at compilation time
p86
aVTo that end, we extend our coarse-to-fine GPU approach to computing marginals, along the way proposing a new way to exploit the coarse pass to avoid expensive log-domain computations in the fine pass
p87
aVFurthermore, they use two NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690 s u'\u005cu2014' each of which is essentially a repackaging of two 680s u'\u005cu2014' meaning that our system and experiments would run approximately four times faster on their hardware (this expected 4x factor is empirically consistent with the result of running their system on our hardware
p88
aVQueueing, which involves copying memory around within the GPU to process the individual parse items, takes a fairly consistent amount of time in all systems
p89
aVNow, when we use a coarse pruning pass, we are able to parse nearly 280 sentences per second, a 70% increase in parsing performance relative to Canny et al
p90
aVThus, there is no concern of warp divergence
p91
aVIn this section, we describe their dense algorithm, which we take as the baseline for our work; we present it in a way that sets up the changes to follow
p92
aV2013 ) yields a speed of 193 sentences per second, whereas the same computation using coarse parent clustering has a speed of 159 sentences per second (see Table 1
p93
aV2013 ) clustered symbols of the grammar using a sophisticated spectral clustering algorithm to obtain a permutation of the symbols
p94
aVThat is, in addition to computing a pruning mask, in the coarse pass we store the maximum inside and outside score in each span, giving two arrays of scores s i , j I and s i , j O
p95
aVAs shown in Table 1 , using a 1-split grammar as a coarse pass allows us to produce over 400 sentences per second, a full 2x improvement over our original system, and 2.5x over Canny et al
p96
aVIn the case of pruned Viterbi, pruning reduces the amount of time spent in the fine pass by more than 4x, though half of those gains are lost to computing the pruning masks
p97
aVThis algorithm maximizes the expected number of correct coarse symbols ( A , i , j ) with respect to the posterior distribution over parses for a sentence
p98
aVThat is, the number is represented as f u'\u005cu2032' = f u'\u005cu22c5' exp u'\u005cu2061' ( s
p99
aVMost of this difference arises at the leaves, where the lexicon typically has more uncertainty than higher up in the tree
p100
aVWe cannot move on to the next cluster until all threads from a cluster are finished, which means that the time a cluster takes is the amount of time taken by the longest-running subcluster
p101
aVThe large number of threads that a GPU executes are packaged into blocks of 32 threads called warps
p102
aVThe unpruned Viterbi computations in a fine grammar using the clustering method of Canny et al
p103
aVIn practice, we found there is an effective maximum of 2000 rules per kernel using log sums, while we can use more than 10,000 rules rules in a single kernel with Viterbi
p104
aVOn the 600 series, maximum occupancy can only be achieved if each thread uses at most 63 registers [ 8 ]
p105
aVWe use a very simple method we cluster the rules in the grammar by coarse parent symbol
p106
aVAt the top level, our system first computes pruning masks with a coarse grammar
p107
aVWithout pruning, our approach does not handle these log domain computations well at all we are only able to compute marginals for 32.1 sentences/second, more than a factor of 5 slower than our coarse pass
p108
aVOn a mid-range GPU, their system can compute Viterbi derivations at 164 sentences per second on sentences of length 40 or less (see timing details below
p109
aV2013 ) proposed a GPU implementation of a constituency parser that sacrifices all sparsity in exchange for the sheer horsepower that GPUs can provide
p110
aVTo improve upon this result, we need to consider how the grammar clustering interacts with the coarse pruning phase
p111
aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s system is able to compute Viterbi charts at 164 sentences per second, for sentences up to length 40
p112
aVThe easiest way to compute marginal probabilities is to use the log space semiring rather than the Viterbi semiring, and then to run the inside and outside algorithms as before
p113
aVAs with other grammars with a parse/derivation distinction, the grammars of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) only achieve their full accuracy using minimum-Bayes-risk parsing, with improvements of over 1.5 F1 over best-derivation Viterbi parsing on the Penn Treebank [ 6 ]
p114
aVOverhead, which includes transport time between the CPU and GPU and other processing on the CPU, is relatively small for most system configurations
p115
aVThus, the vast majority of rules can be skipped, and therefore most computation can be avoided
p116
aVIn the coarse pass, we compute Viterbi inside and outside scores for every span
p117
aVPetrov and Klein ( 2007 ) found that over 98% of symbols can be pruned from typical charts using a simple X-bar grammar without any loss of accuracy
p118
aV2013 ) proposed an implementation of a PCFG parser that sacrifices standard sparse methods like coarse-to-fine pruning, focusing instead on maximizing the instruction and memory throughput of the parser
p119
aVConducting a coarse pass with a 2-split grammar is somewhat slower, at a u'\u005cu201c' mere u'\u005cu201d' 343 sentences per second
p120
aVPetrov and Klein ( 2007 ) showed that MBR trees substantially improved performance over Viterbi parses for latent variable grammars, earning up to 1.5F1
p121
aVBeyond the obvious consequence that executing more operations means more time taken, the sheer number of operations becomes too much for the compiler to handle
p122
aVHowever, in short, the entire grammar G is broken into multiple clusters G i where each rule belongs to exactly one cluster
p123
aVThen the rules of the grammar were laid out in a (sparse) three-dimensional tensor, with one dimension representing the parent of the rule, one representing the left child, and one representing the right child
p124
aVA final question is how many sentences per second do we need to process to saturate the GPU u'\u005cu2019' s processing power
p125
aVRecall that the rules in the grammar are partitioned into a set of clusters, and that these clusters are further divided into subclusters
p126
aVAll experiments are run with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680, a mid-range GPU that costs around $500 at time of writing
p127
aVHowever, in this paper, we present a system that finds a middle ground, where some level of sparsity can be maintained without losing the parallelism of the GPU
p128
aVInstead, we take advantage of the partitioned structure of the grammar and organize our computation around the coarse symbol set
p129
aVWithout the coarse pass, the dense marginal computation is not efficient on a GPU, processing only 32 sentences per second
p130
aVRecall that the baseline already partitions the grammar G into rule clusters G i to improve register sharing
p131
aV2011 ) both had early attempts at porting parsing algorithms to the GPU
p132
aVThat is, for each symbol A x in the fine grammar, there is some symbol A in the coarse grammar
p133
aVThey assume that they are parsing batches of thousands of sentences at a time
p134
aVWe call each such queue a labeled work queue , and each one only queues items to which some rule in the corresponding partition applies
p135
aVWe measured parsing accuracy on sentences of length u'\u005cu2264' 40 from section 22 of the Penn Treebank
p136
aVFor comparison, the publicly available CPU implementation of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) parses approximately 7 sentences per second per core on a modern CPU
p137
aVOur Viterbi parser achieves 89.7 F1, while our MBR parser scores 91.0
p138
aVFirst, we have a coarse grammar, with many fewer rules and symbols
p139
aVTypically, each successive grammar G u'\u005cu2113' is a refinement of the preceding grammar G u'\u005cu2113' - 1
p140
aV2013 ) adapted algorithms designed for GPUs in the computational biology literature to speed up on-demand phrase table extraction
p141
aVIn this section, we provide an overview of GPU architectures, focusing on the details that are relevant to building an efficient parser
p142
aVWe know of no reason why this same trick cannot be employed in more traditional parsers, but it is especially useful here with this static scaling, we can avoid the costly log sums without introducing any additional inter-thread communication, making the kernels much smaller and much faster
p143
aVThe Viterbi algorithm is a reasonably effective method for parsing
p144
aVIt turns out that this simple clustering algorithm produces relatively efficient kernels even in the unpruned case
p145
aVThese parse items are enqueued in order of increasing span size, blocking until all items of a given length are complete
p146
aVOne way to avoid the expense of log domain computations is to use scaled probabilities rather than log probabilities
p147
aVThen it processes the same sentences with the fine grammar
p148
aVTogether these kernels implement the Viterbi inside algorithm
p149
aVTo begin, log space addition requires significantly more operations than max, which is a primitive operation on GPUs
p150
aVWe computed Viterbi parses of successive powers of 10, from 1 to 100,000 sentences
p151
aVUnfortunately, the standard coarse-to-fine approach does not naïvely translate to GPU architectures
p152
aVParse extraction is then just a matter of following back pointers from the root, as in the Viterbi algorithm
p153
aVThen, in the next pass, one only processes rules that are licensed by the pruning mask computed at the previous level
p154
aVOnce on the GPU, parse items are processed using the same style of compiled kernel as in Canny et al
p155
aVA further consideration is that the number of registers available to a thread in a warp is rather limited compared to a CPU
p156
aVIn particular, we use one coarse pass instead of several, and a different MBR algorithm
p157
aVWith coarse pruning, however, we can avoid much of the increased cost associated with log domain computations
p158
aVThe challenge is that GPUs are not a good fit for the kinds of sparse computations that most current CPU-based NLP algorithms rely on
p159
aVThis work was partially supported by BBN under DARPA contract HR0011-12-C-0014, by a Google PhD fellowship to the first author, and an NSF fellowship to the second
p160
aVWe do this in an effort to give a sense of how time is spent during computation on GPUs
p161
aVRecall that floating point numbers are composed of a mantissa m and an exponent e , giving a number f = m u'\u005cu22c5' 2 e
p162
aVWe then implement minimum-Bayes-risk parsing via the max recall algorithm of Goodman ( 1996
p163
aVHowever, the memory architecture is such that they will be faster if they access related memory locations
p164
aVHowever, recent trends in computer architecture, particularly the development of powerful u'\u005cu201c' general purpose u'\u005cu201d' GPUs, have changed the landscape even for problems that parallelize at the sentence level
p165
aVOur reimplementation of their approach is able to achieve 193 sentences per second on the same hardware
p166
aVIn scaling, floating point numbers are paired with an additional number that extends the exponent
p167
aVIn this section we attempt to break down how exactly our system is spending its time
p168
aV2013 ) u'\u005cu2019' s system is grammar compilation
p169
aVUnfortunately, this approach again does not produce a large speedup relative to our reimplemented baseline
p170
aV2013 ) found they had to partition the grammar into multiple different kernels
p171
aVMBR parsing has proven especially useful in latent variable grammars
p172
aVThey then split the cube into 6x2x2 contiguous u'\u005cu201c' major cubes, u'\u005cu201d' giving a partition of the rules into 24 clusters
p173
aVThese max marginals are used to compute a pruning mask for every span ( i , j
p174
aVIn practice, one scale s is used for an entire span ( i , j ) , and all scores for that span are rescaled in concert
p175
aVWe propose a much simpler static solution that exploits the coarse pass
p176
aVIn Figure 4 , we then plotted the throughput, in terms of number of sentences per second
p177
aVHowever, our approach allows us to process over 190 sentences per second, almost a 6x speedup
p178
aVHowever, scores for approximately 0.5% of sentences overflow ( sic
p179
aVMoreover, we would like the time spent processing each of the subclusters within a cluster to be about the same
p180
aVTo that end, we tried computing pruning masks with one-split and two-split Berkeley grammars
p181
aVHowever, our experiments showed that only 40% of parse items are pruned in this manner
p182
aVSecond, compared to CPUs, GPUs devote a much larger fraction of their computational power to actual arithmetic
p183
aVHowever, they did not demonstrate significantly increased speed over a CPU implementation
p184
aVA further drawback of the dense approach in Canny et al
p185
aVSee Section 7 for more on the baseline clustering.) We create a separate work queue for each partition
p186
aV5 5 We replicated the Treebank for the 100,000 sentences pass
p187
aVHowever, many authors have noted that parsers benefit substantially from minimum Bayes risk decoding [ 3 , 10 , 7 , 11 , 9 ]
p188
aVFirst, consider trying to directly apply the coarse-to-fine method sketched in Section 3 to the dense baseline described above
p189
aVThese slight differences arise from the usual minor variation in implementation details
p190
aVThis mask is the set of symbols allowed for that span
p191
aVNVIDIA GPUs have 8-15 processors called streaming multi-processors or SMs
p192
aVWe build up our approach incrementally, with experiments interspersed throughout the paper, and summarized in Tables 1 and 2
p193
aVScaling is one of the folk techniques that are commonly used in the NLP community, but not generally written about
p194
aVIn essence, we must compute the marginal probability of each fine-labeled span u'\u005cu039c' u'\u005cu2062' ( A x , i , j ) , and then marginalize to obtain u'\u005cu039c' u'\u005cu2062' ( A , i , j
p195
aVThey then further subdivided these cubes into 2x2x2 minor cubes, giving 8 subclusters that executed in parallel
p196
aVThis particular MBR algorithm has the advantage that it is relatively straightforward to implement
p197
aVOn a CPU, pruning methods can give speedups of up to 100x
p198
aVOne successful approach for speeding up constituency parsers has been to use coarse-to-fine inference [ 2 ]
p199
aVHere, we implement the Max Recall algorithm of Goodman ( 1996
p200
aVFirst, the span ( i , j ) u'\u005cu2019' s pruning mask must have a non-empty intersection with the signature of the queue
p201
aVNext, one computes (max) marginals for every labeled span ( A , i , j ) in a sentence
p202
aVUsing this slight modification, no sentences from the Treebank under- or overflow
p203
aV2013 ) is that it only computes Viterbi parses
p204
aVHowever, register space is limited on GPUs

aVThe addition of pruning introduces further considerations
p209
aVWe found this approach to subclustering worked well in practice
p210
aVIn this paper, we focus our attention on current-generation NVIDIA GPUs
p211
aVNote that the clusters induced by these major and minor cubes need not be of similar sizes; indeed, they often are not
p212
aVUnlike threads within a single warp, the 48 warps do not have to execute the same instructions
p213
aVThen, for each span ( i , j ) , we find the best possible split point k that maximizes C u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) = u'\u005cu039c' u'\u005cu2062' ( A , i , j ) + max k u'\u005cu2061' ( C u'\u005cu2062' ( i , k ) + C u'\u005cu2062' ( k , j )

p222
aVBy itself, this approach works on nearly every sentence
p223
aVMany of the ideas described here apply to other GPUs (such as those from AMD), but some specifics will differ
p224
aVIn coarse-to-fine inference, we have a sequence of increasingly complex grammars G u'\u005cu2113'
p225
aVHowever, to the extent that the signatures are small, items can be selectively queued only to certain queues
p226
aVThe outside scores are scaled analogously
