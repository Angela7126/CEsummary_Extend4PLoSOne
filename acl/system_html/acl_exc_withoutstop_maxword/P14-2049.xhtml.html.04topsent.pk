VFor each of the 3 rank-biased similarity systems ( R u'\u005cu0391' , si ) and cosine, we computed correlations with human judgments for the pairs in 2 standard wordsets the combined Miller-Charles/Rubenstein-Goodenough word sets [ 15 , 18 ] and the Wordsim 353 word set [ 6 ] , as well as to a subset of the Wordsim set restricted to reflect semantic similarity judgments, which we will refer to as Wordsim 201
