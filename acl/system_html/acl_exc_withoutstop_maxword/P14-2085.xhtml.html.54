<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We aim to leverage existing, possibly noisy sets of representative stative, dynamic or mixed verb types extracted from LCS (see section 3 ), making up for unseen verbs and noise by averaging over distributional similarities</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Using an existing large distributional model [ 31 ] estimated over the set of Gigaword documents marked as stories, for each verb type, we build a syntactically informed vector representing the contexts in which the verb occurs</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since then, it has mostly been treated as a subtask within temporal reasoning, such as in efforts related to TimeBank [ 25 ] and the TempEval challenges [ 34 , 35</a>
