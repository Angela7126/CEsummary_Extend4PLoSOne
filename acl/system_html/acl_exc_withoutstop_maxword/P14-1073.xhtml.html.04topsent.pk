VWe report results using three variations of our model phylo does not consider mention context (all mentions effectively have the same topic) and determines mention entities from a single sample of u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc91' (the last); phylo+topic adds context (§ 5.2 ); phylo+topic+mbr uses the full posterior and consensus clustering to pick the output clustering (§ 7
