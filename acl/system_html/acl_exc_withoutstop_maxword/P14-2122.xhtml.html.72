<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Many languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To this end, we model bilingual UWS under a similar framework with monolingual UWS in order to improve efficiency, and replace Gibbs sampling with expectation maximization (EM) in training</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>UWS learns from unsegmented raw text, which are available in large quantities, and thus it has the potential to provide more accurate and adaptive segmentation than supervised approaches with less development effort being required</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In contrast, UWS, spurred by the findings that infants are able to use statistical cues to determine word boundaries [] , relies on statistical criteria instead of manually crafted standards</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Though supervised-learning approaches which involve training segmenters on manually segmented corpora are widely used [] , yet the criteria for manually annotating words are arbitrary, and the available annotated corpora are limited in both quantity and genre variety</a>
