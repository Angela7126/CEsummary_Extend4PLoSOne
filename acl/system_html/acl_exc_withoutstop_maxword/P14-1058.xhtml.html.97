<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although for illustrative purposes we used the word lightweight , which occurs in both the source and the target domains, our proposed method does not require the source domain distribution w \cS for a word w in a target domain document</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Domain adaptation (DA) of sentiment classification becomes extremely challenging when the distributions of words in the source and the target domains are very different, because the features learnt from the source domain labeled reviews might not appear in the target domain reviews that must be classified</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By predicting the distribution of a word across different domains, we can find source domain features that are similar to the features in target domain reviews, thereby reducing the mismatch of features between the two domains</a>
