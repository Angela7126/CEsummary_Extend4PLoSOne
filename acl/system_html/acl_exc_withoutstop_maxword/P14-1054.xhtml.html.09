<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Based on the characteristics of Chinese, in this paper, an Omni-word feature and a soft constraint method are proposed for Chinese relation extraction</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this section, the employed candidate features are discussed</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The soft constraint is the method to generate the combine features 1 1 If without ambiguity, we also use the terminology of u'\u201c' soft constraint u'\u201d' denoting features generated by the employed constraint conditions</a>
