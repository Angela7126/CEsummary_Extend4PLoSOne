<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By using a general semantic similarity model to match patterns and relations, as well as mentions and entities, our system outperforms the existing rule learning system, Paralex [ 7 ] , with higher precision at all the recall points when answering the questions in the same test set</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In order to provide a fair comparison to previous work, we experimented with our approach using the Paralax dataset [ 7 ] , which consists of paraphrases of questions mined from WikiAnswers and answer triples from ReVerb</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For each selected relation, the system then checked all triples in the KB that had this relation and computed the similarity score between the mention and corresponding argument entity</a>
