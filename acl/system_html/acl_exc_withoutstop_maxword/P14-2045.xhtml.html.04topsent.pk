VThese findings suggest that a query interface in which a user enters a word of interest and the system shows candidate grammatical relations augmented with examples from the text will be more successful than the baseline of simply naming the relation and showing gaps where the participating words appear
p1
aVThe baseline presentation (Figure 4 ) named the linguistic relation and showed a blank space with a pink background for the varying word in the relationship, the focus word highlighted in yellow and underlined, and any necessary additional words necessary to convey the relationship (such as u'\u005cu201c' of u'\u005cu201d' for the prepositional relationship u'\u005cu201c' of u'\u005cu201d' , the third option
p2
aVOur results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks
p3
aVParticipants in conditions that showed examples ( phrases and words ) were significantly more accurate at identifying the relations than participants in the baseline condition
p4
aVAmong these relations, adverb modifiers stood out (Figure 5 ), because evidence suggested that words (63% success) made the relation more recognizable than phrases (47% success, p=0.056, W=574.0) u'\u005cu2013' but the difference was only almost significant, due to the smaller sample size (only 96 participants encountered this relation
p5
aVOne current presentation (not used with auto-suggest) is to name the relation and show blanks where the words that satisfy it would appear as in X is the subject of Y [ 14 ] ; we used this as the baseline presentation in our experiments because it employs the
