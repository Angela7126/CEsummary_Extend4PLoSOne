<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>From a computational perspective, adding non-sparse vectors directly as features, including their combinations, can significantly increase the number of active features for scoring syntactic structures (e.g.,, dependency arc</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In contrast, we represent words as vectors in a manner that is directly optimized for parsing</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By taking the cross-product of all these component feature vectors, we obtain the full feature representation for arc h u'\u2192' m as a rank-1 tensor</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We begin by representing high-dimensional feature vectors as multi-way cross-products of smaller feature vectors that represent words and their syntactic relations (arcs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This framework enables us to learn new syntactically guided embeddings while also leveraging separately estimated word vectors as starting features, leading to improved parsing performance</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Each entry of the word vector is added as a feature value into feature vectors u'\u03a6' h and u'\u03a6' m</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To add auxiliary word vector representations, we use the publicly available word vectors [ 5 ] , learned from raw data [ 13 , 20 ]</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In contrast, we expand features for parsing into a multi-way tensor, and operate with an explicit low-rank representation</a>
