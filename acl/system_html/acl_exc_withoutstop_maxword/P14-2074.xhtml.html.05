<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The main finding of our analysis is that ter and unigram bleu are weakly correlated against human judgements, rouge-su4 and Smoothed bleu are moderately correlated, and the strongest correlation is found with Meteor</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper we estimate the correlation of human judgements with five automatic evaluation measures on two image description data sets</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On the Flickr8k data set, all evaluation measures can be classified as either weakly correlated or moderately correlated with human judgements and all results are significant ter is only weakly correlated with human judgements but could prove useful in comparing the types of differences between models</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Table 1 shows the correlation co-efficients between automatic measures and human judgements and Figures 2 (a) and (b) show the distribution of scores for each measure against human judgements</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Unigram bleu is also only weakly correlated against human judgements, even though it has been reported extensively for this task</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Finally, Meteor is most strongly correlated measure against human judgements</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>First, we report Spearman u'\u2019' s u'\u03a1' correlation coefficient of automatic measures against human judgements, whereas they report agreement between judgements and automatic measures in terms of Cohen u'\u2019' s u'\u039a'</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We estimate Spearman u'\u2019' s u'\u03a1' for five different automatic evaluation measures against human judgements for the automatic image description task</a>
