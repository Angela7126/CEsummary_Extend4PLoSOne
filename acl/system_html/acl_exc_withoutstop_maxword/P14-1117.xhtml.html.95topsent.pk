VMultiple approaches to generate good approximate solutions for joint multi-structure compression, based on Lagrangian relaxation to enforce equality between the sequential and syntactic inference subproblems
p1
aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions
p2
aVAs discussed in § 2.4 , a maximum spanning tree is recovered from the output of the LP and greedily pruned in order to generate a valid integral solution while observing the imposed compression rate
p3
aVIn addition, we can recover approximate solutions to this
