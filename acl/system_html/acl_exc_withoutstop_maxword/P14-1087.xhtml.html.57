<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>SWING is a supervised, extractive summarization system which ranks sentences based on scores computed using a set of features in the Sentence Scoring phase</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a simplifying assumption, events are laid out on the timeline based on the starting time of their time span</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Referring to Figure 1 , whose timeline is shown in Figure 2 , we see that the time span with the most number of events is when the latest cyclone made landfall</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Generalizing, we refer to the time period an event takes place in as its time span (vertical dotted lines</a>
