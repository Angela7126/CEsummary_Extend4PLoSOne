<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Segmentation accuracy is reported as an F1-score of unlabeled segment bracketing</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that segmentation time is negligible compared to the parsing time, hence is omitted in reported time</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The final two rows show performance with automatic segmentation, using a model that includes either unlabeled or labeled segmentation tags, as described in the last section</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use hedge segmentation as a finite-state pre-processing step for hedge context-free parsing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A unique property of hedge constituents compared to constituents in the original parse trees is that they are sequentially connected to the top-most node</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is possible to parse with a standardly induced PCFG using this sort of hedge constrained parsing that only considers a subset of the chart cells, and speedups are achieved, however this is clearly non-optimal, since the model is ill-suited to combining hedges into flat structures at the root of the tree</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Figure 2 plots the percentage of constituents from the original WSJ Penn treebank (sections 2-21) retained in the transformed version, as we vary the maximum span length parameter L</a>
