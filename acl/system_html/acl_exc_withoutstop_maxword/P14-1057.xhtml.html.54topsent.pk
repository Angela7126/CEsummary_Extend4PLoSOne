VS u'\u005cu2062' ( Q , D ) is the relevance score of D with respect to Q e i denotes a concept, and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) denotes the query aspect associated with e , i.e.,, a set of concepts that are mapped to the same phrases as e by using MetaMap i u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) is the normalized confidence score of the mapping for concept e generated by MetaMap c u'\u005cu2062' ( e , D ) denotes the occurrences of concept e in document D , d u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) denotes the number of documents containing e

aVTo further improve the performance, Limsopatham et al proposed a task-specific representation, i.e.,, using only four types of concepts (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment) in the concept-based representation and a query expansion method based on the relationships among the medical concepts [ 12 , 13 ]
p2
aVUnder such a situation, traditional retrieval functions would likely work well and generate satisfying retrieval performance since the relations among concepts are independent which is consistent with the assumptions made in traditional IR [ 18 ]
p3
aVWe then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance
p4
aVExisting studies computed the relevance scores at either visit-level, where all the medical records of a visit are merged into a visit document [ 5
