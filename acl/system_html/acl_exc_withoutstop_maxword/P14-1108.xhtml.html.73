<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>where c u'\u2062' ( w i - n + 1 i ) provides the frequency count that sequence w i - n + 1 i occurs in training data, D is a discount value (which depends on the frequency of the sequence) and u'\u0393' h u'\u2062' i u'\u2062' g u'\u2062' h depends on D and is the interpolation factor to mix in the lower order distribution 1 1 The factors u'\u0393' and D are quite technical and lengthy</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We provide a framework for using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing in combination with a systematic exploration of lower order models based on skip n -grams</a>
