VAnother advantage of the learning framework is that it combines both the likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data, so that both parallel text and unlabeled data can be utilized in our approach
p1
aVWe train probabilistic parsing models for resource-poor languages by maximizing a combination of likelihood on parallel data and confidence on unlabeled data
p2
aVThe focus of this work is on building dependency parsers for target languages, assuming that an accurate English dependency parser and some parallel text between the two languages are available
p3
aVIn this work, we propose a learning framework for transferring dependency grammars from a resource-rich language to resource-poor languages via parallel text
p4
aVObviously, bilingual treebanks are much more difficult to acquire than the resources required in our scenario, since the labeled training data
