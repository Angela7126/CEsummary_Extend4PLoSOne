<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Note that this negative effect on parsing accuracy might be overlooked since most previous work evaluates parsing accuracy without taking punctuations into account</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The fact that most previous work evaluates parsing accuracies without taking punctuations into account is also largely due to this reason</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moreover, experimental results showed that parsing accuracy of content words drops on sentences which contain higher ratios of punctuations</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
