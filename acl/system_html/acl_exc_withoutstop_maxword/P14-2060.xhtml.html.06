<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given an OOV item (possible abbreviation) in context, we make use of features of the context and of the OOV item itself to enumerate and score candidate expansions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To predict the expansion given the context, we extract n-gram observations for full words in the TTS lexicon</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the u'\u201c' SVM u'\u201d' model, we extract features from the log likelihood and log odds scores associated with contextual n-grams, as well as from the pair LM probability and characteristics of the abbreviation itself</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
