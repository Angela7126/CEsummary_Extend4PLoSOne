<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A span is a subtree over a number of consecutive words, with the leftmost or the rightmost word as its root</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Case 4 Merge an incomplete span and a complete span</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The incomplete span is covered by a virtual arc</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Suppose x j is removed, there must be a virtual arc j - 1 u'\u2192' j which is a conflict with the fact that x j is the leftmost word</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our method extends Eisner u'\u2019' s cubic time parsing algorithm by adding signatures to each span, which indicate the number of deleted words and the rightmost kept word within the span, resulting in O u'\u2062' ( n 6 ) time complexity and O u'\u2062' ( n 4 ) space complexity</a>
