<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>2013 ) presented a QA system that maps questions onto simple queries against Open IE extractions, by learning paraphrases from a large monolingual parallel corpus, and performing a single paraphrasing step</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>where the parameters u'\u0398' pr define the paraphrase model (Section 5 ), which is based on features extracted from text only (the input and canonical utterance</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The parameters u'\u0398' lf correspond to semantic parsing features based on the logical form and input</a>
