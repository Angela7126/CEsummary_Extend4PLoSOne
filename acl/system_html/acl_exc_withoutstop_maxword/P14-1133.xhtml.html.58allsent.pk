VNext, we heuristically generate canonical utterances for each logical form based on the text descriptions of predicates from the KB
p1
aVOnce the candidate set of logical forms paired with canonical utterances is constructed, our problem is reduced to scoring pairs ( c , z ) based on a paraphrase model
p2
aVOur system generates relatively natural utterances from logical forms using simple rules based on Freebase descriptions (Section 4
p3
aVWe use two complementary paraphrase models an association model based on aligned phrase pairs extracted from a monolingual parallel corpus, and a vector space model , which represents each utterance as a vector and learns a similarity score between them
p4
aVwhere the parameters u'\u005cu0398' pr define the paraphrase model (Section 5 ), which is based on features extracted from text only (the input and canonical utterance
p5
aVTo construct candidate logical forms u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb5' x for a given utterance x , our strategy is to find an entity in x and grow the logical form from that entity
p6
aVThe parameters u'\u005cu0398' lf correspond to semantic parsing features based on the logical form and input utterance, and are briefly described in this section
p7
aVThis demonstrates that our method for constructing candidate logical forms is reasonable
p8
aVIn conclusion, the main contribution of this paper is a novel approach for semantic parsing based on a simple generation procedure and a paraphrase model
p9
aVFirst, Fader et al use a KB over natural language extractions rather than a formal KB and so querying the KB does not require a generation step u'\u005cu2013' they paraphrase questions to KB entries directly
p10
aVIn Section 6 , we show that an even simpler method of generating canonical utterances by concatenating Freebase descriptions hurts accuracy by only a modest amount
p11
aVIn this paper, we present a novel approach for semantic parsing based on paraphrasing that can exploit large amounts of text not covered by the KB (Figure 1
p12
aVWe define associations in x and c primarily by looking up phrase pairs in a phrase table constructed using the Paralex corpus [ 10 ]
p13
aVThe probability of an answer y is obtained by marginalizing over canonical utterances c and logical forms z whose denotation is y
p14
aVThis is because our simple model allows to associate u'\u005cu201c' hall of fame u'\u005cu201d' with the canonical utterance three times
p15
aV2013 ) presented a QA system that maps questions onto simple queries against Open IE extractions, by learning paraphrases from a large monolingual parallel corpus, and performing a single paraphrasing step
p16
aVFirst, the paraphrase model is decoupled from the KB, so we can train it from large text corpora
p17
aVAs we show later, this procedure actually produces a set with better coverage than constructing logical forms recursively from spans of x , as is done in traditional semantic parsing
p18
aVSince we train from question-answer pairs, we collect answers by executing the gold logical forms against Freebase
p19
aVThe VS model ranks the canonical utterance u'\u005cu201c' What composition has Richard Wagner as lyricist u'\u005cu201d' higher, as this utterance is also in the music domain
p20
aVWe use the word alignments to construct a phrase table by applying the consistent phrase pair heuristic [ 24 ] to all 5-grams
p21
aVSince our generated questions are passed to a paraphrase model, we took a very simple approach, mostly ensuring that we preserved the semantics of the utterance without striving for the most fluent realization
p22
aVFor Freebase entities, we extract a popularity feature based on the entity frequency in an entity linked subset of Reverb [ 22 ]
p23
aVThis is important since for each question-answer pair, we consider thousands of canonical utterances as potential paraphrases
p24
aVFor example, for the logical form Character.Actor.BradPitt , if we match the entity Troy in x , we obtain Character.(Actor.BradPitt u'\u005cu2293' Film.Troy
p25
aVBoth steps are performed with a small and simple set of deterministic rules, which suffices for our datasets, as they consist of factoid questions with a modest amount of compositional structure
p26
aVWe further modify logical forms by intersecting with a unary filter (#4 given a formula z with some Freebase type (e.g.,, People ), we look at all Freebase sub-types t (e.g.,, Composer ), and check whether one of their Freebase descriptions (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' composer u'\u005cu201d' ) appears in x
p27
aVWe believe that our approach opens a window of opportunity for learning semantic parsers from raw text not necessarily related to the target KB
p28
aVThe denotation of a logical form z with respect to a KB u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca6' is given by \u005cllbracket u'\u005cu2062' z u'\u005cu2062' \u005crrbracket u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca6'
p29
aVWhile it has been shown that paraphrasing methods are useful for question answering [ 15 ] and relation extraction [ 27 ] , this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper to perform semantic parsing through paraphrasing
p30
aVFor instance, the utterances u'\u005cu201c' Where is ACL in 2014 u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' What is the location of ACL 2014 u'\u005cu201d' cannot be used in traditional semantic parsing methods, since the KB does not contain an entity ACL2014 , but this pair clearly contains valuable linguistic information
p31
aVThus, word choice in Free917 is often close to the generated Freebase descriptions, allowing simple baselines to perform well
p32
aVFor example, the association model identifies that the paraphrase for u'\u005cu201c' What type of music did Richard Wagner Play u'\u005cu201d' is u'\u005cu201c' What is the musical genres of Richard Wagner u'\u005cu201d' , by relating phrases such as u'\u005cu201c' type of music u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' musical genres u'\u005cu201d'
p33
aVParalex is suitable for our needs since it focuses on question paraphrases
p34
aVWe surmise this is because questions in Free917 were generated by annotators prompted by Freebase facts, whereas questions in WebQuestions originated independently of Freebase
p35
aVWe also add all binary predicates in z as features
p36
aVAnother example is the question u'\u005cu201c' Where is the Nascar hall of fame u'\u005cu201d' , where ParaSempre suggests that u'\u005cu201c' What hall of fame discipline has Nascar hall of fame as halls of fame u'\u005cu201d' is the best canonical utterance
p37
aVLastly, Freebase formulas have types (see Section 4 ), and we conjoin the type of z with the first word of x , to capture the correlation between a word (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' where u'\u005cu201d' ) with the Freebase type (e.g.,, Location
p38
aVOnce associations are constructed, we mark tokens in x and c that were not part of any association, and extract deletion features for their lemmas and POS tags
p39
aVMoreover, we extract a popularity feature for predicates based on the number of instances they have in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudca6'
p40
aVOne can view this work as a generalization of Fader et al along three dimensions
p41
aVThe strength u'\u005cu039b' of the L 1 regularizer is set based on cross-validation
p42
aVClearly, we can increase the expressivity of this step by expanding the template set
p43
aVWe can see that our model learns a positive score for associating u'\u005cu201c' type u'\u005cu201d' with u'\u005cu201c' genres u'\u005cu201d' , and a negative score for associating u'\u005cu201c' is u'\u005cu201d' with u'\u005cu201c' play u'\u005cu201d'
p44
aVThis results in many poor associations (e.g.,, u'\u005cu201c' play u'\u005cu201d' and u'\u005cu201c' the u'\u005cu201d' ), but as illustrated in Figure 3 , we learn weights that discriminate good from bad associations
p45
aVScaling semantic parsers to large knowledge bases has attracted substantial attention recently [ 2 , 1 , 19 ] , since it drives applications such as question answering (QA) and information extraction (IE
p46
aVFor example, ParaSempre suggests that the best paraphrase for u'\u005cu201c' What company did Henry Ford work for u'\u005cu201d' is u'\u005cu201c' What written work novel by Henry Ford u'\u005cu201d' rather than u'\u005cu201c' The employer of Henry Ford u'\u005cu201d' , due to the exact match of the word u'\u005cu201c' work u'\u005cu201d'
p47
aVWe start by constructing vector representations of words
p48
aVFor a pair ( x , c ) , we also consider as candidate associations the set u'\u005cu212c' (represented implicitly), which contains token pairs ( x i , c i u'\u005cu2032' ) such that x i and c i u'\u005cu2032' share the same lemma, the same POS tag, or are linked through a derivation link on WordNet [ 11 ]
p49
aVAs our training data consists of question-answer pairs ( x i , y i ) , we maximize the log-likelihood of the correct answer
p50
aVA fundamental motivation and long standing goal of the paraphrasing and RTE communities has been to cast various semantic applications as paraphrasing/textual entailment [ 4 ]
p51
aVThen, we add the logical form p p 1 e 1 u'\u005cu2293' p 2 e 2 ) , if there exists a binary p 2 with a compatible type signature ( t 1 , t 2 ) , where t 2 is one of e 2 u'\u005cu2019' s types
p52
aVThis strategy is feasible in factoid QA where compositionality is low, and so the size of u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb5' x is limited (Section 4
p53
aVFor example, we could handle superlative utterances ( u'\u005cu201c' What NBA player is tallest u'\u005cu201d' ) by adding a template with an argmax operator
p54
aVThus, we combine the two models to benefit from their complementary nature
p55
aVAs another reference point, out of 500,000 relations extracted by the ReVerb Open IE system [ 9 ] , only about 10,000 can be aligned to Freebase [ 1 ]
p56
aVParaphrasing methods are well-suited for handling such text-to-text gaps
p57
aVBy extracting POS features, we obtain soft syntactic rules, e.g.,, the feature u'\u005cu201c' JJ N u'\u005cu2227' N u'\u005cu201d' indicates that omitting adjectives before nouns is possible
p58
aVWe execute u'\u005cu039b' -DCS queries by converting them into SPARQL and executing them against a copy of Freebase using the Virtuoso database engine
p59
aVThis dataset was created by crawling questions through the Google Suggest API, and then obtaining answers using Amazon Mechanical Turk
p60
aVFinally, we check whether x is an aggregation formula by identifying whether it starts with phrases such as u'\u005cu201c' how many u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' number of u'\u005cu201d' (#5
p61
aVWe optimize the objective by initializing the parameters u'\u005cu0398' to zero and running AdaGrad [ 8 ]
p62
aVThe template p p 1 e 1 u'\u005cu2293' p 2 e 2 ) (#3) is generated by appending the prepositional phrase in d u'\u005cu2062' ( e 2 ) , e.g, u'\u005cu201c' What character is the character of Brad Pitt in Troy u'\u005cu201d'
p63
aVThus, we learn that deleting pronouns is acceptable, while deleting nouns is not
p64
aVIf so, we add the formula u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cude83' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudea2' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cude99' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cude8e' t u'\u005cu2293' z to u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcb5' x
