<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Then the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u2062' S c</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Assigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a simplifying assumption, events are laid out on the timeline based on the starting time of their time span</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, temporal information does assist in identifying which sentences are more relevant to the final summary</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Generalizing, we refer to the time period an event takes place in as its time span (vertical dotted lines</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>TCD parallels this idea with the use of temporal information, i.e., if two sentences are of the same temporal coverage, then the one with more events should carry more useful facts</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Recall that TimeMMR seeks to eliminate redundancy based on time span similarities and not lexical likeness</a>
