<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Stern11 [] and Stern12 [] extend this framework to utilize entailment rules as tree transformations</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When only primary knowledge is used in inference (the first row), recalls are actually very low; After we activate the on-the-fly knowledge, recalls jump to over 50%, with a moderate fall of precision</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by transformed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are preserved in Figure 6 , though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule u'\u201c' X is blamed for death u'\u2192' X causes loss of life u'\u201d' , the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The DCS tree in Figure 1 is interpreted as a command for querying these tables, obtaining u'\u201c' reading u'\u201d' entries whose u'\u201c' SUBJ u'\u201d' field is student and whose u'\u201c' OBJ u'\u201d' field is book</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this logical system, we treat abstract denotations as terms and statements as atomic sentences , which are far more easier to handle than first order predicate logic (FOL) formulas</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our solution is to redefine DCS trees without the aid of any databases, by considering each node of a DCS tree as a content word in a sentence (but may no longer be a table in a specific database), while each edge represents semantic relations between two words</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If a node u'\u03a3' in a DCS tree u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' belongs to a mention cluster m , we take the abstract denotation [[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' u'\u03a3' ]] and make a selection s m u'\u2062' ([[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' u'\u03a3' ]]) , which is regarded as the abstract denotation of that mention</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, this method does not work for real-world datasets such as PASCAL RTE [] , because of the knowledge bottleneck it is often the case that the lack of sufficient linguistic knowledge causes failure of inference, thus the system outputs u'\u201c' no entailment u'\u201d' for almost all pairs []</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Using disjointness we implemented two types of negations i) atomic negation, for each content word w we allow negation w of that word, characterized by the property w u'\u2225' w ; and (ii) root negation, for a DCS tree u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' and its denotation [[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ]] , the negation of u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' is represented by u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' u'\u2225' u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' , meaning that u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' = u'\u2205' in its effect</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>On-the-fly knowledge is generated by aligning paths in DCS trees</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The abstract denotation of a germ is defined in a top-down manner for the root node u'\u03a1' of a DCS tree u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' , we define its denotation [[ u'\u03a1' ]] u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' as the denotation of the entire tree [[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ]] ; for a non-root node u'\u03a4' and its parent node u'\u03a3' , let the edge ( u'\u03a3' , u'\u03a4' ) be labeled by semantic roles ( r , r u'\u2032' ) , then define</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Most of the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system without on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal semantics</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Since meanings of sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations, logical inference among sentences is reduced to deriving new relations among abstract denotations</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Based on abstract denotations, we briefly describe our process to apply DCS to textual inference</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If ( u'\u03a3' , u'\u03a4' i ) is assigned by a quantification marker u'\u201c' u'\u2282' u'\u201d' 8 8 Multiple quantifiers can be processed similarly then the abstract denotation is 9 9 The result of [[ u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ]] depends on the order of the children u'\u03a4' 1 , u'\u2026' , u'\u03a4' n</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Figure 2 shows an example with a quantifier u'\u201c' every u'\u201d' , which is marked as u'\u201c' u'\u2282' u'\u201d' on the</a>
