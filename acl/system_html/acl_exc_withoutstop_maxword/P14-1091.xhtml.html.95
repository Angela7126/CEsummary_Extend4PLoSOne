<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Note, question decomposition only operates on the original question and question spans covered by complete dependency subtrees</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Like MT, CYK parsing is used to parse each input question, and answers of the span covered by each CYK cell are considered the translations of that cell; unlike MT, which uses offline-generated translation tables to translate source phrases into target translations, a semantic parsing-based question translation method is used to translate each span into its answers on-the-fly, based on question patterns and relation expressions</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Two question translation methods are presented in the rest of this subsection, which are based on question patterns and relation expressions respectively</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Table 2 shows the statistics of question patterns and relation expressions used in our KB-QA system</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose a dependency tree-based method to handle such multiple-constraint questions by (i) decomposing the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntax-based patterns; and (ii) intersecting the answers of all sub-questions as the final answers of the original question</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>1) Question answering and semantic parsing are performed in an joint way under a unified framework; (2) A robust method is proposed to map NL questions to their formal triple queries, which trades off the mapping quality by using question patterns and relation expressions in a cascaded way;</a>
