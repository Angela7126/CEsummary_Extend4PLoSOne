<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet</a>
