<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Instead, we base our work on tree edit distance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The tree edit distance (TED) problem is defined analogously to the more familiar problem of string edit distance what is the minimum number of edit operations required to transform one tree into the other</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this article we propose a family of chance-corrected measures of agreement, applicable to both dependency- and constituency-based syntactic annotation, based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For large data sets such as the PCEDT set used in this work, computing u'\u0391' with tree edit distance as the distance measure can take a very long time</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tree edit distance has previously been used in the TedEval software [] for parser evaluation agnostic to both annotation scheme and theoretical framework, but this by itself is still an uncorrected accuracy measure and thus unsuitable for our purposes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Instead, we propose to use an agreement measure based on Krippendorff u'\u2019' s u'\u0391' [] and tree edit distance</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>See \citeN Bille05 for a thorough introduction to the tree edit distance problem and other related problems</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The only work we know of using chance-corrected metrics is \citeN Rag:Dic13, who use MASI [] to measure agreement on dependency relations and head selection in multi-headed dependency syntax, and \citeN Bha:Sha12, who compute Cohen u'\u2019' s u'\u039a' [] on dependency relations in single-headed dependency syntax</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However that work used a boundary edit distance as the basis of a metric for the task of text segmentation</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The idea of using edit distance as the basis for an inter-annotator agreement metric has previously been explored by \citeN Fournier13</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The data studied in this work has previously been used by \citeN Skjaerholt13 to study agreement, but using simple accuracy measures (UAS, LAS) rather than chance-corrected measures</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In future work, we would like to investigate the use of other distance functions, in particular the use of approximate tree edit distance functions such as the p u'\u2062' q -gram algorithm []</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Next, we present a number of synthetic experiments performed in order to find the best distance function for this kind of annotation; finally we contrast our new metric and simple accuracy scores as applied to real-world corpora before concluding and presenting some potential avenues for future work</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The definitive reference for agreement measures in computational linguistics is \citeN Art:Poe08, who argue forcefully in favour of the use of chance-corrected measures of agreement over simple accuracy measures</a>
