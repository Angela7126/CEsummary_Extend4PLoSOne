<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To sum up, Inst features are essential for classifying multi-label verbs, and the LingInd features provide some useful prior</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While most verbs have one predominant interpretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative ( 1 ) or dynamic ( 1 ) depending on the context</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the feature Lemma</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For multi-label verbs, the feature combination Lemma+LingInd+Inst leads to significant 5 improvement of 2% gain in accuracy over the baseline; Table 9 reports detailed class statistics and reveals a gain in F-measure of 3 points over the baseline</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any</a>
