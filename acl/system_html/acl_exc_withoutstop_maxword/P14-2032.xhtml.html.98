<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We can then form the dual of this problem by taking the min outside of the max , which is an upper bound on the original problem</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A powerful feature of the dual decomposition approach is that it can generate correct segmentation decisions in cases where a voting or product-of-experts model could not, since joint decoding allows the sharing of information at decoding time</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These mixing models perform well on standard datasets, but are not in wide use because of their high computational costs and difficulty of implementation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition</a>
