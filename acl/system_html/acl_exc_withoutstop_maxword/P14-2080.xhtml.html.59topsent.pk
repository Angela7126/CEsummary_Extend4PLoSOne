VLinLearn denotes model combination by overloading the vector representation of queries u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2a' and documents u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1d' in the VW linear learner by incorporating arbitrary ranking models as dense features
p1
aVIn addition to dense domain-knowledge features, we incorporate arbitrary ranking models as dense features whose value is the score of the ranking model
p2
aVOptimization for these additional models including domain knowledge features was done by overloading the vector representation of queries u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2a' and documents u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc1d' in the VW linear learner
p3
aVSince Wikipedia articles vary greatly in length, we restricted EN documents to the first 200 words after extracting the link graph to reduce the number of features
p4
