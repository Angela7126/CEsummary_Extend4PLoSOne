<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By taking the cross-product of all these component feature vectors, we obtain the full feature representation for arc h u'\u2192' m as a rank-1 tensor</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We will commence here by casting first-order dependency parsing as a tensor estimation problem</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>From a computational perspective, adding non-sparse vectors directly as features, including their combinations, can significantly increase the number of active features for scoring syntactic structures (e.g.,, dependency arc</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We begin by representing high-dimensional feature vectors as multi-way cross-products of smaller feature vectors that represent words and their syntactic relations (arcs</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>By learning parameters U , V , and W that function well in dependency parsing, we also learn context-dependent embeddings for words and arcs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The associated parameters are viewed as a tensor (multi-way array) of low rank, and optimized for parsing performance</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In contrast, we represent words as vectors in a manner that is directly optimized for parsing</a>
