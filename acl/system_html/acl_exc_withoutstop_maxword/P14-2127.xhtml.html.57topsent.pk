aVFollowing \u005cnewcite yu+:2013, we call our max-violation method MaxForce
p2
aVNIST06 newswire is used as development set for MaxForce training, and as tuning set for all other tuning methods
p3
aVThe max-violation method is more than 15 Bleu points better than the standard perceptron (also known as u'\u005cu201c' bold-update u'\u005cu201d' in \u005cnewcite liang+:2006) which updates at the root of the derivation tree
