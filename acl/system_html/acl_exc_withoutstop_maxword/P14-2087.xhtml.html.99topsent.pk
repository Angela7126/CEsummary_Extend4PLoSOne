VThese systems compared favourably to existing methods in WSD performance, although by using sense frequency information, they are essentially supervised methods
p1
aVSpecifically, highly similar, fine-grained sense candidates apparently share more hypernyms in the fine-grained case than in the coarse-grained case; adding to the generality of hypernyms (both semantic and distributional), we postulate that their probability in the NBM is uniformly inflated among many sense candidates, and hence they decrease in distinguishability
p2
aVModel performance is evaluated in terms of WSD accuracy using Equation ( 2 ) as the scoring function
p3
aVDistributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts
