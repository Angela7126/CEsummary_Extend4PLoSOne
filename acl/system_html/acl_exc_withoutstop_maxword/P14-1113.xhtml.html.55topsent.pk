VFurthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2
p1
aVIn this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2
p2
aVWe then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p3
aVHowever, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations without the whole hierarchy structure
p4
aV2009 ) propose a method based on patterns to find hypernyms on arbitrary noun phrases
p5
aVThe same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym pairs
p6
aVOur previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics
p7
aVThe combination strategy is to simply merge all positive results from the two methods together, and then to infer new relations based on the transitivity of hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
