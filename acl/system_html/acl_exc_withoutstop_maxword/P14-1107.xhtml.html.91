<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Because of this, collecting parallel corpora for minor languages has become an interesting research challenge</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This allows us to compare the BLEU score achieved by our methods against the BLEU scores achievable by professional translators</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since we have four professional translation sets, we can calculate the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score [ 27 ] for one professional translator (P1) using the other three (P2,3,4) as a reference set</a>
