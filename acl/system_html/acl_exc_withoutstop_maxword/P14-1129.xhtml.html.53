<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>One issue with the S2T NNJM is that the probability is computed over every target word, so it does not explicitly model NULL-aligned source words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is easy and computationally inexpensive to use this model in decoding, since only one neural network computation must be made for each source word</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The decoding cost is based on a measurement of u'\u223c' 1200 unique NNJM lookups per source word for our Arabic-English system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, note that there are only 3 possible positions for each target word, and 11 for each source word</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Additionally, on top of a simpler decoder equivalent to Chiang u'\u2019' s [ 5 ] original Hiero implementation, our NNJM features are able to produce an improvement of +6.3 BLEU u'\u2013' as much as all of the other features in our strong baseline system combined</a>
