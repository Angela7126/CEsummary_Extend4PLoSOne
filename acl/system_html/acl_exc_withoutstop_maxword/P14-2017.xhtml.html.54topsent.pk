V2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language
p1
aVFinally, we obtain 445 pairs of cognates for Romanian-French 2 2 The number of pairs of cognates is much lower for French than for the other languages because there are numerous Romanian words which have French etymology and, in this paper, we do not consider these words to be cognate candidates
p2
aVWe discard pairs of words for which the forms across languages are identical (i.e.,, the Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate pair matrice , having the same form), because these pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to be learned
p3
aVFirst, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes
p4
aVTherefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms
p5
aVWe investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity
p6
aVFor measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input
p7
aVGomes and Lopes ( 2011 ) proposed SpSim, a more complex method for computing the similarity of cognate
