<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Numerically, SR sum has the highest ROUGE-1 score and TS sum tops according to ROUGE-2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In future, we plan to use latent topic models to assign a topic to a sentence so that the counts of all the sentence u'\u2019' s words can be aggregated into one dimension</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Central to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u2019' s topic</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In this work, we compare our system to topic word based ones since the latter is also a general method to find surprising new words in a set of input documents but is not a bayesian approach</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Then we normalize the two sets of scores for candidate sentences using z-scores and compute the best sentence as arg u'\u2062' max s i ( TS sum u'\u2062' ( s i )</a>
