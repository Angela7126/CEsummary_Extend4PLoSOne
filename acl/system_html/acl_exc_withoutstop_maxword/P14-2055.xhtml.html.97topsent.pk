VCentral to this approach is the use of a likelihood ratio test to compute topic words , words that have significantly higher probability in the input compared to the background corpus, and are hence descriptive of the input u'\u005cu2019' s topic
p1
aVSo new words in an input are added to the background corpus with a count of 1 and the counts of existing words in the background are incremented by 1 before computing the prior parameters
p2
aVWe use the method to do two types of summarization tasks a) generic news summarization which uses a large random collection of news articles as the background, and b) update summarization where the background is a smaller but specific set of news documents on the same topic as the input set
p3
aVTo reduce redundancy, once a sentence is added, the topic words contained in it are removed from the topic word list before the next sentence selection
p4
aVIn this work, we compare
