<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Abstractive summary sentences can be created by aggregating and merging multiple sentences into an abstract sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, we compare our abstractive system with the first part of our framework (utterance extraction in Figure 1), which can be presented as an extractive query-based summarization system (our extractive system</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In our pipeline we aim at higher recall, since we later filter sentences and aggregate them to generate new abstract sentences</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In other words, using our extractive model described in section 2.1, as a stand alone system, is an effective query-based extractive summarization model</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We also show the results of the version we use in our pipeline (our pipeline extractive system</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>To address such limitations, we propose a fully automatic unsupervised abstract generation framework based on phrasal queries for multimodal conversation summarization</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this section, we show the evaluation results of our proposed framework and its comparison to the baselines and a state-of-the-art query-focused extractive summarization system</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To estimate the utterance score, we view both the query terms and the signature terms as the terms that should appear in a human query-based summary</a>
