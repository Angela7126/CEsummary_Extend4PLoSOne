V[ 14 ] are among the first to study SVM and text mining methods in the market prediction domain, where they align financial news articles with multiple time series to simulate the 33 stocks in the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index

aVIn NLP, many of the probabilistic text models work in the discrete space [ 9 , 2 ] , but our model is different since the text features are sparse, we first perform kernel density estimates to smooth out the zeroing items, and then calculate the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variables

aVTo calibrate the u'\u005cu03a3' matrix, we make use of the power of randomness using the initial u'\u005cu03a3' from MLE, we generate random samples from the Gaussian copula, and then concatenate previously generated joint of Gaussian inverse marginal CDFs with the newly generated random copula numbers, and re-estimate using MLE to derive the final adjusted u'\u005cu03a3'
p3
aVThe idea behind copula theory is that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random vector can be represented in the form of uniform marginal cumulative distribution functions, and a copula that connects these marginal CDFs, which describes the correlations among the input random variables

aVThis is of crucial importance to modeling text data instead of using the classic bag-of-words representation that uses raw counts, we are now working with uniform
