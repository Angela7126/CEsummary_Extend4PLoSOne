VThese techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method
p1
aVWith that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following given query q , pick c = arg max c E P ( c E q ) as a correction
p2
aVAs any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word
p3
aVEach basic correction proceeds as described in Section 2.1 a small number of hypotheses h 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , h K is generated for the query q , hypotheses are scored, and scores are recomputed into normalized posterior probabilities (see Equation 5
p4
aVA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be
