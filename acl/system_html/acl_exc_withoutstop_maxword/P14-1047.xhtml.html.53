<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1) we propose concurrent learning using multi-agent RL as a way to deal with some of the issues of current approaches to dialogue policy learning (i.e.,, the need for SUs and corpora), which may also potentially prove useful for learning via live interaction with human users; (2) we show that concurrent learning can address changes in user behavior over time, and requires multi-agent RL techniques and variable exploration rates; (3) to our knowledge this is the first time that PHC and PHC-WoLF are used for learning dialogue policies; (4) for the first time, the above techniques are applied to a negotiation domain; and (5) this is the first study that compares Q-learning, PHC, and PHC-WoLF in such a variety of situations (varying a large number of parameters</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Figures 6 and 7 show the average distance from the convergence reward as a function of the number of episodes per epoch during training, for 4 and 5 fruits respectively</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus below we focus only on research that is directly related to our work, specifically research on concurrent learning of the policies of multiple agents, and the application of RL to negotiation domains</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>On the other hand when the agent is u'\u201c' losing u'\u201d' the learning rate u'\u0394' L u'\u2062' F should be high so that the agent has more time to adapt to the other agents u'\u2019' policies, which also facilitates convergence</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Thus the environment of an agent is one or more other agents that continuously change their behavior because they are also learning at the same time</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, unlike single-agent RL, multi-agent RL can handle changes in user behavior or in the behavior of other agents participating in the interaction, and thus potentially lead to more realistic dialogue policies in complex dialogue scenarios</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As we will see in section 5 , even though the number of states for each agent is not large, it takes many iterations and high exploration rates for convergence due to the fact that both agents are learning at the same time and the assumption of interacting with a stationary environment no longer holds</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The main idea is that when the agent is u'\u201c' winning u'\u201d' the learning rate u'\u0394' W should be low so that the opponents have more time to adapt to the agent u'\u2019' s policy, which helps with convergence</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Furthermore, it is not clear what constitutes a good SU for dialogue policy learning</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This ability of multi-agent RL can also have important implications for learning via live interaction with human users</a>
