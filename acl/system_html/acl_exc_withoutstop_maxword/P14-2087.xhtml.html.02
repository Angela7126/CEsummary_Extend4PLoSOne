<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When evaluated on a WSD benchmark () , the algorithm compared favourably to Lesk variants (as expected for a supervised method proposed an ensemble model with multiple NB classifiers differing by context window size trained an unsupervised NB classifier using the EM algorithm and empirically demonstrated the benefits of WordNet-assisted () feature selection over local syntactic features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts used distributional thesauri as a knowledge base to increase overlaps, which were, again, assessed by string matching</a>
