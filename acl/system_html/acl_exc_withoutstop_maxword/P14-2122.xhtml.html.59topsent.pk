VThe proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested
p1
aVThus its complexity is U 2 times the unigram model u'\u005cu2019' s complexity
p2
aVThe experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus
p3
aVFor the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than that of the monolingual unigram model, as the states at specific position of F are not only related to the length of the current word, but also related to the length of the word before it
p4
aVThe monolingual bigram model, however, was slower to converge, so we started it from the segmentations of the unigram model, and using 10 iterations
p5
aVThe monolingual expectation is calculated according to Eq
p6
aV[] proposed a bilingual method by adding alignment into the generative model, but was only able to test it on small-scale BTEC data
p7
aVUWS learns models by maximizing the likelihood of the unsegmented corpus, formulated as
p8
aVThe set u'\u005cu2131' is chosen to represent an unsegmented foreign
