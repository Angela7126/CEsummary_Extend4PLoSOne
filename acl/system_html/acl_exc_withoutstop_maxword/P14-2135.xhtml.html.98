<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As Table 1 illustrates, the concepts with the lowest dispersion in this sample are, without exception, highly concrete, and the concepts of highest dispersion are clearly very abstract</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On this more diverse sample, which reflects the range of concepts typically found in linguistic corpora, image dispersion is a particularly useful diagnostic for identifying the very abstract or very concrete concepts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We apply image dispersion-based filtering as follows if both concepts in an evaluation pair have an image dispersion below a given threshold, both the linguistic and the visual representations are included</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The importance of the visual modality is significantly greater when evaluating on pairs for which both concepts are classified as concrete than on pairs of two abstract concepts</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We compare dispersion filtered representations with linguistic, perceptual and standard multi-modal representations (concatenated linguistic and perceptual representations</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For both datasets, we set the threshold as the median image dispersion, although performance could in principle be improved by adjusting this parameter</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Image dispersion is also an effective predictor of concreteness on samples for which the abstract/concrete distinction</a>
