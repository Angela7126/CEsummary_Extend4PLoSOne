<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We compare dispersion filtered representations with linguistic, perceptual and standard multi-modal representations (concatenated linguistic and perceptual representations</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>On this more diverse sample, which reflects the range of concepts typically found in linguistic corpora, image dispersion is a particularly useful diagnostic for identifying the very abstract or very concrete concepts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We apply image dispersion-based filtering as follows if both concepts in an evaluation pair have an image dispersion below a given threshold, both the linguistic and the visual representations are included</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As Table 1 illustrates, the concepts with the lowest dispersion in this sample are, without exception, highly concrete, and the concepts of highest dispersion are clearly very abstract</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u222a' C introduced in Section 2</a>
