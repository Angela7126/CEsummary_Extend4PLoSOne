<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given samples of sign language videos (unknown sign language with one signer per video), our system performs the following steps to learn a feature representation (note that these video samples are separate from the video samples that are later used for classifier learning or testing</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Extract patches</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, it learns a feature representation from patches of unlabelled raw video data [ 12 , 4 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Sign language recognition is the recognition of the meaning of the signs in a given known sign language, whereas sign language identification is the recognition of the sign language itself from given signs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Second, it looks for activations of the learned representation (by convolution) and uses these activations to learn a classifier to discriminate between sign languages</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Extract small videos (hereafter called patches) randomly from anywhere in the video samples</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>While some work exists on sign language recognition 1 1 There is a difference between sign language recognition and identification</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>More specifically, we show how K-means and sparse autoencoder can be used to learn features for sign language identification b ) demonstrate the impact on</a>
