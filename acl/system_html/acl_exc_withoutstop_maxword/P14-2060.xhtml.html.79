<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our abbreviation model is a pair character language model (LM), also known as a joint multi-gram model [] , whereby aligned symbols are treated as a single token and a smoothed n-gram model is estimated</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
