<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Guided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Not surprisingly, Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson u'\u2019' s correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near non-existence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These high error rates at the recognition stage negatively affect the subsequent stages of the speech scoring system in general, and in particular, during a deep syntactic analysis, which operates on a long sequence of words as its context</a>
