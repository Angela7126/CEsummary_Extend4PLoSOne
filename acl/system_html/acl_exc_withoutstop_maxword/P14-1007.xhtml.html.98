<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We proceed with argument crawling and label crawling , which pick up \spred _the_q \slnkc 03 and \spred _german_n_1 as the \srl ARG1</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This leads us to \spred _no_q as our entry point into the graph</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As with the logical-forms representations we use, the DRS logical forms do not include function words as predicates in the semantics</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Further, as the \srl ARG2 of \spred _know_v_1, we reach \spred thing and through recursive invocation we activate \spred _of_p and, in yet another level of recursion, \spred _the_q \slnkc 5760 and \spred _matter_n_of</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus in order to match the gold annotations, we define a set of heuristics for when to count vacuous words as in scope</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>At this point, crawling has no more links to follow</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our crawling rules operate on semantic representations, but the annotations are with reference to the surface string</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, the string-based annotations also include words which the ERG treats as semantically vacuous</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Accordingly, we need projection rules to map from the u'\u2018' painted u'\u2019' MRS to the string</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Since in this case, the negation cue will not be a quantifier in the MRS, there will be no functor crawling to the verb u'\u2019' s EP</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Having been unable to find a generalization capturing when comodifiers are annotated as in scope,</a>
