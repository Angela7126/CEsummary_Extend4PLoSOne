<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Participants in conditions that showed examples ( phrases and words ) were significantly more accurate at identifying the relations than participants in the baseline condition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Most existing interfaces for syntactic search (querying over grammatical and syntactic structures) require structured query syntax</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the Corpus Query Language [ 8 ] , a query is a pattern of attribute-value pairs, where values can include regular expressions containing parse tree nodes and words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, the popular Stanford Parser includes Tregex, which allows for sophisticated regular expression search over syntactic tree structures [ 12 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In each task, they were shown a list of sentences containing a particular syntactic relationship between highlighted words</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The average success rate was 48% for phrases , which is significantly more than words</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The average success rate in the baseline condition was 41%, which is significantly less accurate than words</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The Finite Structure Query tool for querying syntactically annotated corpora requires its queries to be stated in first order logic [ 9 ]</a>
