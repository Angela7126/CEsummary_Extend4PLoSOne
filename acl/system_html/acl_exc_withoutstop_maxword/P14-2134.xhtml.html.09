<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For comparison, we also partition the data among all 51 states, and train a single model for each state using only data from that state</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While the two models that include geographical information naturally outperform the model that does not, the Joint model generally far outperforms the Individual models trained on state-specific subsets of the data</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This model defines a joint parameterization over all variable values in the data, where information from data originating in California, for instance, can influence the representations learned for Wisconsin; a naive alternative would be to simply train individual models on each variable value (a u'\u201c' California u'\u201d' model using data only from California, etc</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>1 1 This result is robust to the choice of distance metric; an evaluation measuring the Euclidean distance between vectors shows the Joint model to outperform the Individual and u'\u2013' Geo models across all seven categories</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluate our model by confirming its face validity in a qualitative analysis and estimating its accuracy at the quantitative task of judging geographically-informed semantic similarity</a>
