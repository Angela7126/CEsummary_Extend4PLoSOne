VThe original RNTN and the PSTN predict 5-class sentiment for each negated phrase; we map the output to real-valued scores based on the scale that used to map real-valued sentiment scores to sentiment categories
p1
aVBy examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment
p2
aVSuch models work in a bottom-up fashion over the parse tree of a sentence to infer the sentiment label of the sentence as a composition of the sentiment expressed by its constituting parts
p3
aVData As described earlier, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] has manually annotated, real-valued sentiment values for all phrases in parse trees
p4
aVFollowing the idea of , we regard the sentiment of p 1 as a prior sentiment as it has not been affected by the specific context (negators), so we denote our method as prior sentiment-enriched tensor network (PSTN
p5
aVA recursive neural tensor network (RNTN) is a specific form of feed-forward neural network based on syntactic (phrasal-structure) parse tree to conduct compositional sentiment analysis
p6
aVFor example, if a phrase very good modified by a negator not appears in the training and test data, the system can simply memorize the sentiment score of not very good in training and use this score at testing
p7
aVThis could suggest that
