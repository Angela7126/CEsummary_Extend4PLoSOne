<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions in the lexicon these too make sign languages across the world very similar in appearance, even though the meaning of specific articulations may differ [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Part of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows</a>
