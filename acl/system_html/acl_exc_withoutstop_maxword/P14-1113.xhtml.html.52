<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For distributional similarity computing, each word is represented as a semantic vector composed of the pointwise mutual information (PMI) with its contexts</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we improve on their work by learning multiple linear projections in the embedding space, to model hypernym u'\u2013' hyponym relationships within different clusters</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Several other works relied heavily on lexical patterns, which would suffer from deficiency because such patterns can only cover a small proportion of complex linguistic circumstances [ 10 , 23 ]</a>
