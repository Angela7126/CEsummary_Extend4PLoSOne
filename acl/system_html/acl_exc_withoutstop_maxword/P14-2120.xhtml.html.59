<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p u'\u2032' , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u201c' derailment of train u'\u201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u201c' crash of train u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>On the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Second, each NI should be classified as Definite NI (DNI) , meaning that the role filler must exist in the discourse, or Indefinite NI otherwise</a>
