<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A very common paradigm for acquiring such representations is based on the distributional hypothesis of Harris [ 16 ] , stating that words in similar contexts have similar meanings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We thus seek a representation that captures semantic and syntactic similarities between words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this paper we experiment with dependency-based syntactic contexts</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Based on the distributional hypothesis, many methods of deriving word representations were explored in the NLP community</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Syntactic contexts capture different information than bag-of-word contexts, as we demonstrate using the sentence u'\u201c' Australian scientist discovers star with telescope u'\u201d'</a>
