VMany languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT
p1
aVUWS learns from unsegmented raw text, which are available in large quantities, and thus it has the potential to provide more accurate and adaptive segmentation than supervised approaches with less development effort being required
p2
aVThe proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested
p3
aVThese variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS
p4
aVThe experimental results show that the proposed UWS methods are comparable to the Stanford segmenters on the OpenMT06 corpus, while achieves a 0.96 BLEU increase on the PatentMT9 corpus
p5
aVUWS learns models by maximizing the likelihood of the unsegmented corpus, formulated as
p6
aVFor the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than
