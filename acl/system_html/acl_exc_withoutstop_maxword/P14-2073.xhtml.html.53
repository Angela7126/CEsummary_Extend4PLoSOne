<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, at the end of step i of the particle filter, each of the i tokens seen so far in the training sequence has an equal probability of being in the reservoir, hence being selected for rejuvenation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We attempted to correct this by drawing the rejuvenation sequence from a reservoir, but our results indicate that the particle filter for LDA on our dataset is</a>
