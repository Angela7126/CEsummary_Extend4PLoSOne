VWe will experiment with the semantic representations used in and , based on WordNet 2.1

aVOn the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors
p2
aVWe will examine the influence of each type of semantic information on sentences that contain or not POS errors, and this will clarify whether the increments obtained when using semantic information are useful for correcting the negative influence of POS errors or they are orthogonal and constitute a source of new information independent of POS tags

aVFor each semantic representation, we need to determine the semantics of each occurrence of a target word used i) gold-standard annotations from SemCor, a subset of the PTB, to give an upper
