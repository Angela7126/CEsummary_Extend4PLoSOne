VSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and MWE information, but also a classification of MWEs into regular and irregular, and the internal syntactic structure of regular MWEs
p1
aVIn this section, we propose to better evaluate the difficulty of combining the tasks of MWE analysis and dependency parsing by comparing our systems with systems performing simpler tasks i.e., MWE recognition without parsing, and parsing with no or limited MWE recognition, simulated by using gold MWEs
p2
aVTo define the regular expressions, we grouped gold MWEs according to the pair [global POS of the MWE + sequence of POS of the MWE components], and designed regular expressions to match the most frequent patterns that looked regular according to
