<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>With different number of induced and gold standard clusters the 1-1 measure suffers because some induced clusters cannot be mapped to gold clusters or vice versa</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, the mapping between a surface form and morphology is complex and nonlinear, so that simple metrics such as edit distance will only weakly approximate morphological similarity</a>
