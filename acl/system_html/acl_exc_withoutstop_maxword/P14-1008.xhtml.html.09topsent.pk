VOn-the-fly knowledge is generated by aligning paths in DCS trees
p1
aVAs the semantics of DCS trees is formulated by abstract denotations, the meanings of declarative sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations
p2
aVBased on abstract denotations, we briefly describe our process to apply DCS to textual inference
p3
aVPerform rule-based conversion from dependency parses to DCS trees, which are translated to statements on abstract denotations
p4
aVIn this section we describe the idea of representing natural language semantics by DCS trees, and achieving inference by computing logical relations among the corresponding abstract denotations
p5
aVThe strict semantics of DCS trees brings us the idea of applying DCS to logical inference
p6
aVConvert accepted path alignments into statements on abstract denotations, use them in logical inference as new knowledge, and try to prove H again
p7
aVTo formulate the database querying process defined by a DCS tree, we provide formal semantics to DCS trees by employing relational algebra [] for representing the query
p8
aVFurthermore, since the on-the-fly knowledge is generated by transformed pairs of DCS trees, all contexts are preserved in Figure 6 , though the tree transformation can be seen as generated from the entailment rule u'\u005cu201c' X is blamed for death u'\u005cu2192' X causes loss of life u'\u005cu201d' , the generated on-the-fly knowledge, as shown above the trees, only fires with the additional condition that X is a tropical storm and is Debby
p9
aVDCS trees has been proposed to represent natural language semantics with a structure similar to dependency trees [] (Figure 1
p10
aVWe obtain DCS trees from dependency trees, to bypass the need of a concrete database
p11
aVAbstract denotation of a DCS tree can be calculated in a bottom-up manner
p12
aVSince meanings of sentences are represented by statements on abstract denotations, logical inference among sentences is reduced to deriving new relations among abstract denotations
p13
aVA path is considered as joining two germs in a DCS tree, where a germ is defined as a specific semantic role of a node
p14
aVThe conversion is done by first performing a DCS tree transformation according to the aligned paths, and then declare a subsumption relation between the denotations of aligned germs
p15
aVThis formulation keeps the simpleness and computability of DCS trees mostly unaffected; for example, our semantic calculation for DCS trees is parallel to the denotation computation in original DCS
p16
aVWe built an inference engine to perform logical inference on abstract denotations as above
p17
aVMost of the problems do not require lexical knowledge, so we use our primary textual inference system without on-the-fly knowledge nor WordNet, to test the performance of the DCS framework as formal semantics
p18
aVTechnically, each germ in a DCS tree indicates a variable when the DCS tree is translated to a FOL formula, and the abstract denotation of the germ corresponds to the set of consistent values [] of that variable
p19
aVFor example, to apply the aligned path pair generated in Figure 5 , we use it to transform T into a new tree T u'\u005cu2019' (Figure 6 ), and then the aligned germs, OBJ ( blame ) in T and SUBJ ( cause ) in T u'\u005cu2019' , will generate the on-the-fly knowledge
p20
aVAbstract denotations and statements are convenient for representing semantics of various types of expressions and linguistic knowledge
p21
aVTo obtain DCS trees from natural language, we use Stanford CoreNLP 5 5 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml for dependency parsing [] , and convert Stanford dependencies to DCS trees by pattern matching on POS tags and dependency labels
p22
aVIf H is not proven, compare DCS trees of T and H , and generate path alignments
p23
aVThe idea is to borrow a minimal set of operators from relational algebra [] , which is already able to formulate the calculation in DCS and define abstract denotation , which is an abstraction of the computation of denotations guided by DCS trees
p24
aVFor example, Figure 5 shows DCS trees of the following sentences (a simplified pair from RTE2-dev
p25
aVAccepted aligned paths are converted into statements, which are used as new knowledge
