<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our previous method based on web mining [ 8 ] works well for hypernym extraction of entity names, but it is unsuitable for semantic hierarchy construction which involves many words with broad semantics</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For distributional similarity computing, each word is represented as a semantic vector composed of the pointwise mutual information (PMI) with its contexts</a>
