VWe treat NULL as a normal target word, and if a source word aligns to multiple target words, it is treated as a single concatenated token
p1
aVIf t i is unaligned, we inherit its affiliation from the closest aligned word, with preference given to the right
p2
aVFor aligned target words, the normal affiliation heuristic can be used, since the word alignment is available within the rule
p3
aVHowever, note that there are only 3 possible positions for each target word, and 11 for each source word
p4
aVIf t is on the left edge of the arc, we say it is affiliated with s i
p5
aVTherefore, for every word in the vocabulary, and for each position, we can pre-compute the dot product between the word embedding and the first hidden layer
p6
aVFor unaligned words, the normal heuristic can also be used, except when the word is on the edge of a rule, because then the target neighbor words are not necessarily known
p7
aVThus, the total cost increase of using the NNJM+NNLTM features
