<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our parser can be easily adapted to this task by replacing the X-bar grammar over treebank symbols with a grammar over the sentiment values to encode the output variables and then adding n-gram indicators to our feature set to capture the bulk of the lexical effects</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our span features appear to work well on both head-initial and head-final languages (see Basque and Korean in the table), and the fact that our parser performs well on such morphologically-rich languages as Hungarian indicates that our suffix model is sufficient to capture most of the morphological effects relevant to parsing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Adding these simple features (first word, last word, and lengths) as span features of the X-bar grammar already gives us a substantial improvement over our baseline system, improving the parser u'\u2019' s performance from 73.0 F1 to 85.0 F1 (see Table 1</a>
