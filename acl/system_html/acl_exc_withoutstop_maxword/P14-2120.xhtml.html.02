<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For the scope of this experiment we developed a simple RTE system, which uses the F1 optimized logistic regression classifier of Jansche ( 2005 ) with two features lexical coverage and predicate-argument relationships coverage</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic role appears elsewhere and can be inferred from discourse</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Statistical features in prior works mostly capture general properties of the predicate and the argument, like selectional preferences, lexical similarities, etc</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On the contrary, our statistical features follow the intuition that explicit predicate-argument relationships in the discourse provide plausible indication that an implied relationship holds as well</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This paper addresses a typical sub-task in textual inference scenarios, of recognizing implied predicate-argument relationships which are not expressed explicitly through syntactic structure</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We suggest, however, that the same challenge, as well as the solutions proposed in our work, are applicable, with proper adaptations, to other textual-inference scenarios, like Question Answering , and Information Extraction (see Section 6</a>
