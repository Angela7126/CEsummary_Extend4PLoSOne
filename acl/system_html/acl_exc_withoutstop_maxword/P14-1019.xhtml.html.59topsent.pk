VHowever, for the joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset we do not use the Random Walk method because the first-order features in normal parsing are no longer first-order when POS tags are also variables

aVJoint Parsing and POS Correction Table 3 shows the results of joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset, for our model and state-of-the-art systems
p2
aVThe reranker uses the same features as our model, along with the tree scores obtained from the MST parser (which is a standard practice in reranking
p3
aVWe generate the POS candidate list for each word based on the confusion matrix on the training set
p4
aVThe reranker operates over the top-50 list obtained from the MST parser 4 4 The MST parser is trained in projective mode
