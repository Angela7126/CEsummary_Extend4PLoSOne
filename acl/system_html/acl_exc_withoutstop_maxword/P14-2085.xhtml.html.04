<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context ( stative , dynamic , both ), we assume a supervised learning setting and explore features mined from a large background corpus, distributional features, and instance-based features</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We replicate their method using publicly available software, create a similar but larger corpus, 1 1 Direct comparison on their data is not possible; feature values for the verbs studied are available, but full texts and the English Slot Grammar parser [ 20 ] are not and show that it is indeed possible to predict the aspectual class of unseen verbs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Siegel ( 1998a ) investigates a classification method for the verb have in context; inspired by this work, our present work goes one step further and uses a larger set of instance-based contextual features to perform experiments on a set of 20 verbs</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Their model fails to outperform a baseline of memorizing the most frequent class of a verb type, and they present an experiment testing on unseen verb types only for the related task of classifying completedness of events</a>
