<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The binary result is based on a DCNN that has a wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a dynamic k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity; it has a second wide convolutional layer followed by a folding layer, a k -max pooling layer and a non-linearity</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can be adopted as a sentence model []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Like in the convolutional networks for object recognition [] , we enrich the representation in the first layer by computing multiple feature maps with different filters applied to the input sentence</a>
