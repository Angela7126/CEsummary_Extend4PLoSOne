<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The loss function is defined as following so as to minimize the information lost</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So as to integrate such global information, and also keep the ability to generate tree structure, we combine the recurrent neural network and the recursive neural network to be a recursive recurrent neural network (R 2 NN</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We call them recurrent input vectors, since they are borrowed from recurrent neural networks</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In R 2 NN, new information can be used to generate the next hidden state, like recurrent neural networks, and a tree structure can be built, as recursive neural networks</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In recursive neural networks, all the representations of nodes are generated based on their child nodes, and it is difficult to integrate additional global information, such as language model and distortion model</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The commonly used binary recursive neural networks generate the representation of the parent node, with the representations of two child nodes as the input</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In order to integrate these crucial information for better translation prediction, we combine recurrent neural networks into the recursive</a>
