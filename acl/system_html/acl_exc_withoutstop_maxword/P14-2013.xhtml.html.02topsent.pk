VHan [ 8 ] uses local dependency between NE mention and the candidate entity, and semantic relatedness between candidate entities to construct a referent graph, proposing a collective inference algorithm to infer the correct reference node in the graph

aVFollowing most researchers in this area, we treat entries in a large knowledge base (KB) as surrogates for real world entities when carrying out NED and, in particular, use Wikipedia as the reference KB for disambiguating NE mentions

aVEL is a similar but broader task than NED because NED is concerned with disambiguating a textual NE mention where the correct entity is known to be one of the KB entries, while EL also requires systems to deal with the case where there is
