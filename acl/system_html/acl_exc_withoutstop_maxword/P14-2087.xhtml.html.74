<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>WordNet senses are often used in Senseval and SemEval tasks, and hence senses (or synsets, and possibly their corresponding word forms) that are semantic related to the inventory senses under WordNet relations are easily obtainable and have been exploited by many existing studies</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The input of the proposed NBM is bags of words, and thus it is straightforward to incorporate various forms of lexical knowledge (LK) for word senses by concatenating a tokenized knowledge source to the existing knowledge representation u'\ud835' u'\udc1f' , while the similarity measure remains unchanged</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Distributional methods have been used in many WSD systems in quite different flavours than the current study proposed a Lesk variant where each gloss word is weighted by its idf score in relation to all glosses, and gloss-context association was incremented by these weights rather than binary, overlap counts</a>
