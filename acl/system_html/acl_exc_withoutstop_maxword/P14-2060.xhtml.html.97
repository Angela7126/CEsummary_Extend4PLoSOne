<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We also experimented with a number of alternative high precision approaches that space precludes our presenting in detail here, including pruning the number of expansion candidates based on the pair LM score; only allowing abbreviation expansion when at least one extracted n-gram context is present for that expansion in that context; and CART tree [] training with real valued scores</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We then take the Bayesian fusion of this model with the pair LM, by adding them in the log space, to get prediction from both the context and abbreviation model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also have features that fire for each type of contextual feature (e.g.,, trigram with expansion as middle word, etc.), including u'\u2018' no context u'\u2019' , where none of the trigrams or bigrams from the current example that include the candidate expansion are present in our list</a>
