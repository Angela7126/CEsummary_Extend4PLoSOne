<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By looking into the pattern set and the selected words at each iteration, we found that the pattern set ( u'\ud835' u'\udcab' ) converges soon to the same set after a few iterations; and at the beginning several iterations, the selected words are almost the same although the order of adding the words is different</a>
