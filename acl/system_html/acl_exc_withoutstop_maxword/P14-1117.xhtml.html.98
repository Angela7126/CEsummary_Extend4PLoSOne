<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An approximate inference approach based on an LP relaxation of ILP-Dep</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The features used in this work are largely based on the features from Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 )</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We therefore consider methods to recover approximate solutions for the subproblem of finding the maximum weighted subtree in a graph, common among which is the use of a linear programming relaxation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As discussed in 2.4 , a maximum spanning tree is recovered from the output of the LP and greedily pruned in order to generate a valid integral solution while observing the imposed compression rate</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Compression has also been used as a tool for document summarization [ 12 , 49 , 6 , 34 , 2</a>
