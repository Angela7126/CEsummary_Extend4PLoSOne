<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We tested all three methods on the u'\u201d' common u'\u201d' dataset as well to evaluate if our handling of hard cases affects the performance of our approach on the common cases of spelling error</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Posterior is defined by Equation 6 for the baseline and simple iterative methods and by Equations 3 and 6 for the proposed method</a>
