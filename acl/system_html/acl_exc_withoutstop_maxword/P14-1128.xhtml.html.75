<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Crucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One of our main objectives is to bias CRFs model u'\u2019' s learning on unlabeled data, under a non-linear GP constraint encoding the bilingual knowledge</a>
