<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy the u'\u201c' no crossing links u'\u201d' constraint, and errors in punctuations may prevent correct word-word dependencies from being created (see section 2</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The result indicates that by removing punctuations, we lose some information that is important for dependency parsing</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The result is that more than 31 u'\u2062' % of the parameter updates are caused due to punctuations, though punctuations account for only 11.6 u'\u2062' % of the total tokens in the training set</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The fact that most previous work evaluates parsing accuracies without taking punctuations into account is also largely due to this reason</a>
