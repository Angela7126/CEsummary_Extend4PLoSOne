<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We evaluated the ability of the method to learn predominant senses and induce word sense distributions, based on a broad range of datasets and two separate sense inventories</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In summary, we have proposed a topic modelling-based method for estimating word sense distributions, based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and the earlier work of on word sense induction, in probabilistically mapping the automatically-learned topics to senses in a sense inventory</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Word sense distributions tend to be Zipfian, and as such, a simple but surprisingly high-accuracy back-off heuristic for word sense disambiguation ( wsd ) is to tag each instance of a given word with its predominant sense []</a>
