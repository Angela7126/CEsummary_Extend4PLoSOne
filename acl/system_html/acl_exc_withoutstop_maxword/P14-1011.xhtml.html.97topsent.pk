VAs the semantic phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase, we can go a step further in the phrase-based SMT and feed the semantic phrase embeddings to DNN in order to model the whole translation process (e.g., derivation structure prediction
p1
aVAccordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning
p2
aVAs translation equivalents share the same semantic meaning, we employ high-quality phrase translation pairs as training corpus in this work
p3
aVIn decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation candidate selection
p4
aVAssuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings
p5
aVInstead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT
p6
aVThis indicates that the proposed BRAE model is effective at learning semantic phrase embeddings
p7
aVWith the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate
