VVector spaces have been also popular in cognitive science figuring prominently in simulations of human behavior involving semantic priming, deep dyslexia, text comprehension, synonym selection, and similarity judgments (see
p1
aVA large body of work has focused on projecting words and images into a common space using a variety of deep learning methods ranging from deep and restricted Boltzman machines () , to autoencoders () , and recursive neural networks
p2
aVDrawing inspiration from the successful application of attribute classifiers in object recognition, show that automatically predicted visual attributes act as substitutes for feature norms without any critical information loss
p3
aVSeveral other models have been extensions of Latent Dirichlet Allocation () where topic distributions are learned from words and other perceptual units use visual words which they extract from a corpus of multimodal documents (i.e.,, BBC news articles and their associated images), whereas others () use feature norms obtained in longitudinal elicitation studies (see for an example) as an approximation of the visual environment
p4
aVIn the categorization setting, Chinese Whispers (CW) produces a hard clustering over a weighted graph whose nodes correspond to words and edges to cosine similarity scores between vectors representing their meaning
p5
aVAs an indicator to how well automatically extracted attributes can approach the performance of clean human generated attributes, we also report results of a distributional model induced from McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) norms (see the row labeled McRae in the table
p6
aVThe literature describes several successful approaches to multimodal learning using different variants of deep networks () and data sources including text, images, audio, and video
p7
aVFirstly, attributes provide a natural way of expressing salient properties of word meaning as demonstrated in norming studies (e.g.,, ) where humans often employ attributes when asked to describe a concept
p8
aVUnlike most previous work, our model is defined at a finer level of granularity u'\u005cu2014' it computes meaning representations for individual words and is unique in its use of attributes as a means of representing the textual and visual modalities
p9
aVTo learn meaning representations of single words from textual and visual input, we employ stacked (denoising) autoencoders (SAEs
p10
aVIn general, these models specify mechanisms for constructing semantic representations from text corpora based on the distributional hypothesis words that appear in similar linguistic contexts are likely to have related meanings
p11
aVIn sum, our experiments show that the bimodal SAE model delivers superior performance across the board when compared against competitive baselines and related models
p12
aVThe task of categorization (i.e.,, grouping objects into meaningful categories) is a classic problem in the field of cognitive science, central to perception, learning, and the use of language
p13
aVIn this work, we introduce a model, illustrated in Figure 1 , which learns grounded meaning representations by mapping words and images into a common embedding space
p14
aVExamples include information retrieval () , search query expansions () , document classification () , and question answering
p15
aVFirstly, most of these approaches aim to learn a shared representation between modalities so as to infer some missing modality from others (e.g.,, to infer text from images and vice versa); in contrast, we aim to learn an optimal representation for each modality and their optimal combination
p16
aVThe automatically obtained textual and visual attribute vectors serve as input to SVD, kCCA, and our stacked autoencoder (SAE
p17
aVA model akin to Latent Semantic Analysis () is proposed in who concatenate two independently constructed textual and visual spaces and subsequently project them onto a lower-dimensional space using Singular Value Decomposition
p18
aVWe furthermore report results obtained with Bruni et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) bimodal distributional model, which employs SVD to integrate co-occurrence-based textual representations with visual representations constructed from low-level image features
p19
aVThis suggests that both modalities contribute complementary information and that the SAE model is able to extract a shared representation which improves generalization performance across tasks by learning them jointly
p20
aVWe also assess whether the learnt representations are appropriate for categorization, i.e.,, grouping a set of objects into meaningful semantic categories (e.g.,, peach and apple are members of fruit , whereas chair and table are furniture
p21
aVWe evaluated the clusters produced by CW using the F-score measure introduced in the SemEval 2007 task () ; it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall defined as the number of correct members of a cluster divided by the number of items in the cluster and the number of items in the gold-standard class, respectively
p22
aVThe SAE outperforms both kCCA and SVD by a large margin delivering clustering performance similar to the McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) norms
p23
aVFinally, we also compare to the word embeddings obtained using Mikolov et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) recurrent neural network based language model
p24
aVThe bimodal autoencoder is fed with the concatenated final hidden codings of the visual and textual modalities as input and maps these inputs to a joint hidden layer u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' u'\u005cu02d8' with B units
p25
aVUnlike previous efforts such as the widely used WordSim353 collection () , our dataset contains ratings for visual and textual similarity, thus allowing to study the two modalities (and their contribution to meaning representation) together and in isolation
p26
aVAs baselines, we also report the performance of a model based solely on textual attributes (which we obtain from Strudel), visual attributes (obtained from our classifiers), and their concatenation (see row Attributes in Table 2 , and columns T, V, and T+V, respectively
p27
aVThat is, we unfold the stacked autoencoder and furthermore add a softmax output layer on top of the bimodal layer u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' u'\u005cu02d8' that outputs predictions u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2d' ^ with respect to the inputs u'\u005cu2019' object labels (e.g.,, boat
p28
aVThe presented model has connections to several lines of work in NLP, computer vision research, and more generally multimodal learning
p29
aVThe use of stacked autoencoders to extract a shared lexical meaning representation is new to our knowledge, although, as we explain below related to a large body of work on deep learning
p30
aVAutoencoders are a means to learn representations of some input by retaining useful features in the encoding phase which help to reconstruct the input, whilst discarding useless or noisy ones
p31
aVWe also transformed the dataset into hard categorizations by assigning each noun to its most typical category as extrapolated from human typicality ratings (for details see
p32
aVThroughout our experiments we compare a bimodal stacked autoencoder against unimodal autoencoders based solely on textual and visual input (left- and right-hand sides in Figure 1 , respectively
p33
aVWe follow Silberer et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) partition of the dataset into training, validation, and test set and acquire visual vectors for each of the sets
p34
aVThe visual and textual modalities on which our model is trained are decoupled in that they are not derived from the same corpus (we would expect co-occurring images and text to correlate to some extent) but unified in their representation by natural language attributes
p35
aVParticipants were asked to rate a pair on two dimensions, visual and semantic similarity using a Likert scale of 1 (highly dissimilar) to 5 (highly similar
p36
aVThese models still represent words as vectors resulting from the combination of representations with different statistical properties that do not necessarily have a natural correspondence (e.g.,, text and images
p37
aVDuring training we used correlation analysis (Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu03a1' ) to monitor the degree of linear relationship between model cue-associate (cosine) similarities and human probabilities
p38
aVOur work employs deep learning (a.k.a deep networks) to project linguistic and visual information onto a unified representation that fuses the two modalities together
p39
aVSecondly, our problem setting is different from the former studies, which usually deal with classification tasks and fine-tune the deep neural networks using training data with explicit class labels; in contrast we fine-tune our autoencoders using a semi-supervised criterion
p40
aVWe give details on the tasks and datasets used for evaluation, we explain how the textual and visual inputs were constructed, how the SAE model was trained, and describe the approaches used for comparison with our own work
p41
aVThe dataset contains a classification, produced by human participants, of McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) nouns into (possibly multiple) semantic categories (40 in total
p42
aVWe therefore apply masking noise to one modality with a masking factor v (see Section 3.1 ), so that the corrupted modality optimally has to rely on the other modality in order to reconstruct its missing input features
p43
aVThey allow to generalize to new instances for which there are no training examples available and to transcend category and task boundaries whilst offering a generic description of visual data ()
p44
aVTwo control pairs from were included in each task to potentially help identify and eliminate data from participants who assigned random scores
p45
aVGrounded semantic spaces are essentially distributional models augmented with perceptual information
p46
aVRecent years have seen a surge of interest in single word vector spaces () and their successful use in many natural language applications
p47
aVTable 5 shows examples of clusters produced by Chinese Whispers when using vector representations provided by the SAE model
p48
aVThen, we join these two SAEs by feeding their respective second coding simultaneously to another autoencoder, whose hidden layer thus yields the fused meaning representation
p49
aVThese are 541 concrete animate and inanimate objects (e.g.,, animals, clothing, vehicles, utensils, fruits, and vegetables
p50
aVIn this task, simple concatenation of visual and textual attributes does not yield improved performance over the individual modalities (see row Attributes in Table 4
p51
aVSpecifically, we concatenate the textual and visual vectors and project them onto a lower dimensional latent space using SVD
p52
aVAs our input consists of natural language attributes, the model would infer textual attributes given visual attributes and vice versa
p53
aVThe goal of deep learning is to learn multiple levels of representations through a hierarchy of network architectures, where higher-level representations are expected to help define higher-level concepts
p54
aVOur model learns higher-level meaning representations for single words from textual and visual input in a joint fashion
p55
aVDespite differences in formulation, most existing models conceptualize the problem of meaning representation as one of learning from multiple views corresponding to different modalities
p56
aVThe underlying idea is that the learned latent representation is good if the autoencoder is capable of reconstructing the actual input from its corruption
p57
aVThese results indicate that the participants found the task relatively straightforward and produced similarity ratings with a reasonable level of consistency
p58
aVSpecifically, we used an updated version of their dataset to train SVM-based attribute classifiers that predict visual attributes for images
p59
aVWe would expect the textual modality to be more dominant when modeling semantic similarity and conversely the perceptual modality to be stronger with respect to visual similarity
p60
aVCW can optionally apply a minimum weight threshold which we optimized using the categorization dataset from
p61
aVThis resulted in 7,576 word pairs for which we obtained similarity ratings using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT
p62
aVTo further optimize the parameters of the network, a supervised criterion can be imposed on top of the last hidden layer such as the minimization of a prediction error on a supervised task
p63
aVThe latter is approximated by feature norms elicited from humans () , visual information extracted automatically from images, () or a combination of both
p64
aVOur model uses stacked autoencoders () to induce semantic representations integrating visual and textual information
p65
aVTable 3 shows examples of word pairs with highest semantic and visual similarity according to the SAE model
p66
aVAlternatively, a semi-supervised criterion can be used () through combination of the unsupervised training criterion (global reconstruction) with a supervised criterion (prediction of some target given the latent representation
p67
aVWe thus created a new dataset consisting exclusively of nouns which we hope will be useful for the development and evaluation of grounded semantic space models
p68
aVExamples include imposing a bottleneck to produce an under-complete representation of the input, using sparse representations, or denoising
p69
aVThese were established by presenting participants with a cue word (e.g.,, canary ) and asking them to name an associate word in response (e.g.,, bird, sing, yellow
p70
aVWe opted for this specific measure as it achieves high correlation with human ratings and has a high coverage on our nouns
p71
aVThe visual modality is represented by bag-of-visual-words histograms built on the basis of clustered SIFT features
p72
aVWe also observe that simply concatenating textual and visual attributes (Attributes, T+V) performs competitively with SVD and better than kCCA
p73
aVIn the first task, model estimates of word similarity (e.g.,, gem u'\u005cu2013' jewel are similar but glass u'\u005cu2013' magician are not) are compared against elicited similarity ratings
p74
aVWe learn meaning representations for the nouns contained in McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) feature norms
p75
aVInterestingly, the bimodal SAE is better than the unimodal variants on both types of similarity judgments, semantic and visual
p76
aVThat is, we use indirect supervision in the form of object classification in addition to the objective of reconstructing the attribute-centric input representation
p77
aVThe additional supervised criterion drives the learning towards a representation capable of discriminating between different objects
p78
aVThe vector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, examples of which are shown in Figure 2
p79
aVTo this end, different strategies have been employed to guide parameter learning and constrain the hidden representation
p80
aVOur model learns multimodal representations from attributes which are automatically inferred from text and images
p81
aVThese models learn the meaning of words based on textual and perceptual input
p82
aVWe evaluated model output against a gold standard set of categories created by
p83
aVWords are grounded in the external environment and relate to sensorimotor experience
p84
aVEach noun is represented as a vector with dimensions corresponding to attributes elicited by participants of the norming study
p85
aVModel parameters were optimized on a subset of the word association norms collected by
p86
aVEach task consisted of 32 pairs covering examples of weak to very strong semantic relatedness
p87
aVSubsequently, the original input layer and hidden representations of all the autoencoders are stacked and all network parameters are fine-tuned with backpropagation
p88
aVThis model has the following architecture the textual autoencoder (see Figure 1 , left-hand side) consists of 700 hidden units which are then mapped to the second hidden layer with 500 units (the corruption parameter was set to v = 0.1 ); the visual autoencoder (see Figure 1 , right-hand side) has 170 and 100 hidden units, in the first and second layer, respectively
p89
aVWe also encourage the autoencoder to detect dependencies between the two modalities while learning the mapping to the bimodal hidden layer
p90
aVFurthermore, the semi-supervised setting affords flexibility, allowing to adapt the architecture to specific tasks
p91
aVUsing this unsupervised pre-training procedure, initial parameters are found which approximate a good solution
p92
aVVector components are set to the (normalized) frequency with which participants generated the corresponding attribute
p93
aVWe measured inter-subject agreement as the average pairwise correlation coefficient (Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu03a1' ) between the ratings of all annotators for each task
p94
aVWe rebuilt their model on the ESP image dataset () using Bruni et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) publicly available system
p95
aVRecall that participants were asked to provide ratings on two dimensions, namely semantic and visual similarity
p96
aVThis indicates that higher level embeddings may be beneficial to NLP tasks in general, not only to those requiring multimodal information
p97
aVThirdly, attributes are well-suited to describing visual phenomena (e.g.,, objects, scenes, actions
p98
aVFor that purpose, the autoencoders are pre-trained layer by layer, with the current layer being fed the latent representation of the previous autoencoder as input
p99
aVMore recently, topic models which combine both feature norms and visual words have also been introduced
p100
aVThe 500 textual and 100 visual hidden units were fed to a bimodal autoencoder containing 500 latent units, and masking noise was applied to the textual modality with v = 0.2
p101
aVTextual attributes were extracted by running Strudel () on a 2009 dump of the English Wikipedia
p102
aVAnother approach is to unfold the stacked autoencoders and fine-tune them with respect to the minimization of the global reconstruction error
p103
aVThe target vector is derived as follows each object o in our data is represented by multiple images, and each image is in turn represented by a visual attribute vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22'
p104
aVAs shown in Figure 1 , our model takes as input two (real-valued) vectors representing the visual and textual modalities
p105
aVNext, for each word we randomly selected 30 pairs under the assumption that they are representative of the full variation of semantic similarity
p106
aVThe first one is based on kernelized canonical correlation (kCCA, ) with a linear kernel which was the best performing model in
p107
aVAlthough several relevant datasets exist, such as the widely used WordSim353 () or the more recent Rel-122 norms () , they contain many abstract words, (e.g.,, love u'\u005cu2013' sex or arrest u'\u005cu2013' detention ) which are not covered in
p108
aVFor comparison, Patwardhan and Pedersen u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) measure achieved a coefficient of 0.56 on the dataset for semantic similarity and 0.48 for visual similarity
p109
aVWe report correlation coefficients of model predictions against similarity ratings
p110
aVSeveral (denoising) autoencoders can be used as building blocks to form a deep neural network
p111
aVHowever, we wanted to avoid overfitting, and show that our parameters are robust across tasks and datasets
p112
aVWe only retained the ten highest scored attributes for each target word
p113
aVStrudel is a fully automatic method for extracting weighted word-attribute pairs (e.g.,, bat u'\u005cu2013' species:n , bat u'\u005cu2013' bite:v ) from a lemmatized and POS-tagged corpus
p114
aVWe used the model described above and the meaning representations obtained from the output of the bimodal latent layer for all the evaluation tasks detailed below
p115
aVBoth input modalities are vector-based representations of words, or, more precisely, the objects they refer to (e.g.,, canary , trolley
p116
aVTo account for this, new types of perceptually grounded distributional models have emerged
p117
aVWe performed a large-scale evaluation on a new dataset consisting of human similarity judgments for 7,576 word pairs
p118
aVWe first briefly review autoencoders in Section 3.1 with emphasis on aspects relevant to our model which we then describe in Section 3.2
p119
aVWe normalize both unimodal input codings to unit length
p120
aVWe first train SAEs with two hidden layers (codings) for each modality separately
p121
aVSimilar methods have been employed to combine other modalities such as speech and video () or images
p122
aVAlthough our model is conceptually similar to these studies (especially those applying stacked autoencoders), it differs considerably from them in at least two aspects
p123
aVIt is interesting to note that the unimodal SAEs are in most cases better than the raw textual or visual attributes
p124
aVIn their model, the textual modality is represented by the 30K-dimensional vectors extracted from UKWaC and WaCkypedia
p125
aVIn this section we present our experimental setup for assessing the performance of our model
p126
aVWe only considered attributes assigned to at least two nouns in the dataset, obtaining a 414 dimensional vector for each noun
p127
aVTo obtain a clustering of nouns, we used Chinese Whispers () , a randomized graph-clustering algorithm
p128
aVInitially, we created all possible pairings over McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) nouns and computed their semantic relatedness using u'\u005cu2019' s WordNet-based measure
p129
aVCW is a non-parametric model, it induces the number of clusters (i.e.,, categories) from the data as well as which nouns belong to these clusters
p130
aVWe use the visual vectors of the training and development set for training the autoencoders, and the vectors for the test set for evaluation
p131
aVFor each cue, the norms provide a set of associates and the frequencies with which they were named
p132
aVSecondly, from a modeling perspective, attributes allow for easier integration of different modalities, since these are rendered in the same medium, namely, language
p133
aVAn autoencoder is an unsupervised neural network which is trained to reconstruct a given input from its latent representation
p134
aVWe finally build a stacked bimodal autoencoder (SAE) with all pre-trained layers and fine-tune them with respect to a semi-supervised criterion
p135
aVSome performance gains could be expected if parameter optimization took place separately for each task
p136
aVIn our experiments, we initialized Chinese Whispers with different graphs resulting from different vector-based representations of the nouns
p137
aVWe evaluate the embeddings it produces on two tasks, namely word similarity and categorization
p138
aVThe norms were elicited by asking participants to list properties (e.g.,, barks , an_animal , has_legs ) describing the nouns they were presented with
p139
aVThese nouns were excluded from the gold standard () in our final evaluation
p140
aVFor example, by setting the corruption parameter v for the textual modality to one and u'\u005cu0394' r to zero, a standard object classification model for images can be trained
p141
aVIn contrast, all bimodal models (SVD, kCCA, and SAE) are better than their unimodal equivalents and RNN-640
p142
aVOn both tasks, our model outperforms baselines and related models
p143
aVVector dimensions correspond to textual and visual attributes, respectively
p144
aVThe third row in the table presents three variants of our model trained on textual and visual attributes only (T and V, respectively) and on both modalities jointly (T+V
p145
aVWe employ denoising autoencoders (DAEs) for pre-training the textual modality
p146
aVTable 2 presents our results on the word similarity task
p147
aVTo obtain visual vectors, we followed the methodology put forward in
p148
aVFor both modalities, we use the hyperbolic tangent function as activation function for encoder f u'\u005cu0398' and decoder g u'\u005cu0398' u'\u005cu2032' and an entropic loss function for L
p149
aVSetting v close to one for either modality enables the model to infer the other (missing) modality
p150
aVWe considered an outlier to be any individual whose mean pairwise correlation fell outside two standard deviations from the mean correlation
p151
aVThe correlation between the average ratings of the AMT annotators and the Miller and Charles (1991) dataset was u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.91
p152
aVThe bimodal autoencoder (SAE, T+V) outperforms all other bimodal models on both similarity tasks
p153
aVThe best autoencoder on the word association task obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.33
p154
aVFinally, we stack all layers and unfold them in order to fine-tune the SAE
p155
aVThis performance is superior to the results reported in (their correlation coefficients range from 0.16 to 0.28
p156
aVThe elicitation study comprised overall 255 tasks, each task was completed by five volunteers
p157
aVAfter outlier removal, we further examined how well the participants agreed in their similarity judgments
p158
aVWeights are log-likelihood ratio scores expressing how strongly an attribute and a word are associated
p159
aVAnalogously to the textual representations, visual vectors were scaled to the [ - 1 , 1 ] range
p160
aV4 4 435 word pairs constitute the overlap between Nelson et al u'\u005cu2019' s norms ( ) and McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) nouns
p161
aVIn our experiments (see Section 5 ), we correlate model-based cosine similarities with mean similarity ratings (again using Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu03a1'
p162
aVThis is for a good reason, as most abstract words do not have discernible attributes, or at least attributes that participants would agree upon
p163
aVFinally, u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2d' ^ ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) is the object label vector predicted by the softmax layer for input vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) , and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2d' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) is the correct object label, represented as a O -dimensional one-hot vector 1 1 In a one-hot vector, the element corresponding to the object label is one and the others are zero
p164
aVWe also compare our model against two approaches that differ in their fusion mechanisms
p165
aVFor semantic similarity, the mean correlation was 0.76 (Min = 0.34, Max = 0.97, StD = 0.11) and for visual similarity 0.63 (Min = 0.19, Max = 0.90, SD = 0.14
p166
aVThe weighting parameters for the joint training objective of the stacked autoencoder were set to u'\u005cu0394' r = 0.8 and u'\u005cu0394' c = 1 (see Equation ( 4
p167
aVOne possible corruption process is masking noise , where the corrupted version u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) results from randomly setting a fraction v of u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) to 0
p168
aVThe dataset is a taxonomy of 636 visual attributes (e.g.,, has_wings , made_of_wood ) and nearly 700K images from ImageNet () describing more than 500 of McRae et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) nouns
p169
aVRegarding the visual autoencoder, we derive a new ( u'\u005cu2018' denoised u'\u005cu2019' ) target vector to be reconstructed for each input vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) , and treat u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) itself as corrupted input
p170
aVWord meaning, however, is also tied to the physical world
p171
aVWe first evaluated how well our model predicts word similarity ratings
p172
aVAnd the visual SAE correlates better with visual similarity judgments ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.60) compared to the textual SAE ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.52
p173
aVThe dataset contains a very large number of cue-associate pairs (63,619 in total) some of which luckily are covered in
p174
aVExamples of the stimuli and mean ratings are shown in Table 1
p175
aVThe overall objective to be minimized is therefore the weighted sum of the reconstruction error L r and the classification error L c
p176
aVThe second one emulates Bruni et al u'\u005cu2019' s ( ) fusion mechanism
p177
aVThe target vector is the sum of u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) and the centroid u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc23' ) of the remaining attribute vectors representing object o
p178
aVThis returned a total of 2,362 dimensions for the textual vectors
p179
aVThe unimodal autoencoder is thus trained to denoise a given input
p180
aVWe follow in arguing that an attribute-centric representation is expedient for several reasons
p181
aVThe textual SAE correlates better with semantic similarity judgments ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.65) than its visual equivalent ( u'\u005cu03a1' = 0.60
p182
aVThe classifiers perform reasonably well with an interpolated average precision of 0.52
p183
aVThe training criterion with denoising autoencoders is the reconstruction of clean input u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' ) given a corrupted version u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc31' ~ ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc22' )
p184
aVAll these models run on the same datasets/items and are given input identical to our model, namely attribute-based textual and visual representations
p185
aV11.5% of the annotations were detected as outliers and removed
p186
aVWe review related work in these areas below
p187
aVThe similarity data was post-processed so as to identify and remove outliers
p188
aVwhere u'\u005cu0394' r and u'\u005cu0394' c are weighting parameters that give different importance to the partial objectives, L c and L r are entropic loss functions, and R is a regularization term with R = u'\u005cu2211' j = 1 5 2 u'\u005cu2062' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc16' ( u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc23'
p189
aVWe explain how these representations are obtained in more detail in Section 4.1
