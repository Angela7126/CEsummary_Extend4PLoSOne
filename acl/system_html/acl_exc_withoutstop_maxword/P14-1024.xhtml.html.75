<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Supersenses are particularly attractive features for metaphor detection coarse sense taxonomies can be viewed as semantic concepts, and since concept mapping is a process in which metaphors are born, we expect different supersense co-occurrences in metaphoric and literal combinations</a>
