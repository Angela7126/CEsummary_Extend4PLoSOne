<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, it is often observed that events mentioned in tweets are also reported in news articles in the same period [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this section, we first describe the Twitter corpus used in our experiments and then present how we build a baseline based on the previously proposed TwiCal system [ 14 ] , the state-of-the-art open event extraction system on tweets</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As illustrated in Figure 1 , our proposed framework consists of three main steps, pre-processing, event extraction based on the LEM model and post-processing</a>
