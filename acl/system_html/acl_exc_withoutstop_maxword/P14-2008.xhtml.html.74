<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our approach achieves similar macro- F 1 on only the citation sentence, but using a different corpus we have shown that you can improve citation polarity classification by leveraging large amounts of annotated data from other domains and using a simple set of features</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Of course the risk in approaching the problem as domain adaptation is that the domains are so different that the representation of a positive instance of a movie or product review, for example, will not coincide with that of a positive scientific citation</a>
