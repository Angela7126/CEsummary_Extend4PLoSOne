<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We now conduct experiments on Med11 to compare its performance with those of using average IDF and minimum IDF ones as the representative concept</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is clear that the right plot (i.e.,, selecting the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept) is the best choice since the changes make the points less scattered</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We then propose two concept-based weighting regularization methods so that the regularized retrieval functions would satisfy the retrieval constraints and achieve better retrieval performance</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Table 6 summarizes the results, and shows that using the maximum IDF value performs better than the other choices</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, this method also suffers the limitation that its effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the concept mapping results</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In a way, the constraint aims to counteract the arbitrary statistics inflation caused by MetaMap results and balance the weight among concepts based on the importance of the associated query aspects</a>
