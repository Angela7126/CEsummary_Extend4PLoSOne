<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>String alignment is closely related to the task of sequence alignment in computational biology</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>2013 ) proposed a method for cognate production relying on statistical character-based machine translation, learning orthographic production patterns, and Mulloni ( 2007 ) introduced an algorithm for cognate production based on edit distance alignment and the identification of orthographic cues when words enter a new language</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, to align pairs of words we employ the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm [ 29 ] , which is mainly used for aligning sequences of proteins or nucleotides</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Algorithms for string alignment were successfully used for identifying cognates based on both their forms, orthographic and phonetic</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>According to Gusfield ( 1997 ) , an edit transcript (representing the conversion of one string to another) and an alignment are mathematically equivalent ways of describing relationships between strings</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The algorithm uses dynamic programming and, thus, guarantees to find the optimal alignment</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For orthographic alignment, we consider words as input sequences and we use a very simple substitution matrix, which gives equal scores to all substitutions, disregarding diacritics (e.g.,, we ensure that e and are matched</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our intuition is that inferring language-specific rules for aligning words will lead to better performance in the task of cognate identification</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For measuring phonetic and orthographic proximity of cognate candidates, string similarity metrics can be applied, using the phonetic or orthographic word forms as input</a>
