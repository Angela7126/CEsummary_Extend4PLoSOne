<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Additionally, its classifier implementation does not output scores or probabilities</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To train our system on binarized data, we replaced the u'\u2113' 2 -regularized linear regression model with an u'\u2113' 2 -regularized logistic regression and used Kendall u'\u2019' s u'\u03a4' rank correlation between the predicted probabilities of the positive class and the binary gold standard labels as the grid search metric ( 3.1 ) instead of Pearson u'\u2019' s r</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the ordinal task, we report Pearson u'\u2019' s r between the averaged human judgments and each system</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So that predictions better match the distribution of labels in the training data, the system rescales its predictions</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>4 4 Regression models typically produce conservative predictions with lower variance than the original training data</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since the predictions from the binary and ordinal systems are on different scales, we include the nonparametric statistic Kendall u'\u2019' s u'\u03a4' as a secondary evaluation metric for both tasks</a>
