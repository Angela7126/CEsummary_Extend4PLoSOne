<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For the monolingual bigram model, the number of states in the HMM is U times more than that of the monolingual unigram model, as the states at specific position of F are not only related to the length of the current word, but also related to the length of the word before it</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The proposed method with monolingual bigram model performed poorly on the Chinese monolingual segmentation task; thus, it was not tested</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The set u'\u2131' is chosen to represent an unsegmented foreign language sentence (a sequence of characters), because an unsegmented sentence can be seen as the set of all possible segmentations of the sentence denoted F , i.e., F u'\u2208' u'\u2131'</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These variables are large in number and it is not clear how to apply VB to UWS, and as far the authors aware there is no previous work related to the application of VB to monolingual UWS</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Many languages, especially Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Myanmar, have no explicit word boundaries, thus word segmentation (WS), that is, segmenting the continuous texts of these languages into isolated words, is a prerequisite for many natural language processing applications including SMT</a>
