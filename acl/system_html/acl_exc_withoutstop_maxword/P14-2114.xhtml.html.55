<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Named entities from tweets are extracted by looking up the dictionary through fuzzy matching</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is not easy to accurately identify named entities in the Twitter data since tweets contain a lot of misspellings and abbreviations</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial step since the results would directly impact the final extracted 4-tuple u'\u27e8' y , d , l , k u'\u27e9'</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, it is often observed that events mentioned in tweets are also reported in news articles in the same period [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We thus perform named entity recognition in the following way</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After the pre-processing step, non-location entities y , locations l , dates d and candidate keywords of the tweets are collected as the input to the LEM model for event extraction</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We propose an unsupervised latent variable model, called the Latent Event Model (LEM), to extract events from tweets</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Approaches to event extraction from Twitter make use of a graphical model to extract canonical entertainment</a>
