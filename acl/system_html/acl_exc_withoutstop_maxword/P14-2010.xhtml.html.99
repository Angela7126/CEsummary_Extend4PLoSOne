<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If a word in a document is a sprinkled word then while sampling a class label for it, we sample the class label associated with the sprinkled word, otherwise we sample a class label for the word using Gibbs update in Equation 1</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>While classifying a test document, its probability distribution over class labels is inferred using TS-LDA model and it is classified to its most probable class label</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If more than one class labels are assigned to the topic t, then we randomly select one of the class labels assigned to the topic t</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the topic assigned to the word w at the position n in document d is t, then we replace it by the class label assigned to the topic t</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We name this model as Topic Sprinkled LDA (TS-LDA</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator</a>
