<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We demonstrate good domain transfer performance between these corpora, suggesting that answer discourse structures are largely independent of domain, and thus broadly applicable to NF QA</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We propose a novel answer reranking (AR) model that combines lexical semantics (LS) with discourse information, driven by two representations of discourse a shallow representation centered around discourse markers and surface text information, and a deep one based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse framework [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>[ 20 ] extracted 47 cue phrases such as because from a small collection of web documents, and used the cosine similarity between an answer candidate and a bag of words containing these cue phrases as a single feature in their reranking model for non-factoid why QA</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The first is a measure of the overall LS similarity of the question and answer candidate, which is computed as the cosine similarity between the two composite vectors of the question and the answer candidate</a>
