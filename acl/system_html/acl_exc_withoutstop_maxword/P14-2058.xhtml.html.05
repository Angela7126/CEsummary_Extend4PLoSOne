<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the results obtained by , who showed that the keyword method results in better long-term word retention than rote memorization, we would expect the error rate reduction to be even higher in a delayed post-test</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results clearly indicate that one group (A1) by chance contained easier words to memorize as shown by the low error rate (between 3% and 4%) obtained with both methods</a>
