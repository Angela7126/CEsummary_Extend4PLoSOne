<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the idea of u'\u201c' annotation time u'\u201d' linked with complexity, we devise a technique to create a dataset annotated with SAC</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The complexity in sentiment annotation stems from an interplay of the two and we expect SAC to capture the combined complexity of both the sub-processes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The process of sentiment annotation consists of two sub-processes comprehension (where the annotator understands the content) and sentiment judgment (where the annotator identifies the sentiment</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It may be thought that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) provides implicit annotation the higher the agreement, the easier the piece of text is for sentiment annotation</a>
