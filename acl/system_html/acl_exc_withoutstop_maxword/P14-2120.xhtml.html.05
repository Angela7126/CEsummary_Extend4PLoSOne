<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Two terms in the Hypothesis, predicate and argument , are marked, where a predicate-argument relationship between them is explicit in the Hypothesis syntactic structure</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The input includes a Text and a Hypothesis</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An RTE problem instance is composed of two text fragments, termed Text and Hypothesis , as input</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Two terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument , aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For our problem, consider a positive Text Hypothesis pair, where the Text is example ( 1 ) above and the Hypothesis is ii</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The task is to recognize whether a human reading the Text would infer that the Hypothesis is most likely true [ 3 ]</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Let p and a be the candidate predicate and the argument in the text</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While they are not connected syntactically, each of them often has an explicit relationships with other terms in the text, that might support the sought (implied) relationship between a and p</a>
