VComparing the two approximation strategies shows a clear performance advantage for DP+LP over DP+LP u'\u005cu2192' MST the latter approach entails slower inference due to the overhead of running the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm at every dual update, and furthermore, the error introduced by approximating an integral solution results in a significant decrease in dependency recall

aVIn this work, we develop approximate inference strategies to the joint approach of Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) which trade the optimality guarantees of exact ILP for faster inference by separately solving the n-gram and dependency subproblems and using Lagrange multipliers to enforce consistency between their solutions

aVFurthermore, much recent work has focused on the challenge of joint sentence extraction and compression,
