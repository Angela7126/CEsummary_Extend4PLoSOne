<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While choosing arg u'\u2062' max of the posterior probability is an optimal decision rule in theory, in practice it might not be optimal, due to limitations of the language and error modeling</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the baseline noisy channel and iterative spellers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Posterior probabilities are then either used to pick the best correction (in baseline and simple iterative correction), or are accumulated to later compute the score defined by Equation 3</a>
