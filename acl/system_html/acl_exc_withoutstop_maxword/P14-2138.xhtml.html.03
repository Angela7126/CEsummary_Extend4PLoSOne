<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We are interested in identifying the character bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words in order to quantify their impact on the bigram-based classifier</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the first experiment, we showed that the removal of the 100 most discriminative words from the training data results in a significant drop in the accuracy of the classifier that is based exclusively on character bigrams</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this section, we describe two experiments aimed at quantifying the importance of the discriminative words and the indicative character bigrams that are identified by Algorithm 2</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the second experiment, we found that the majority of the most indicative character bigrams are shared among different language sets</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The results are shown in the Discriminative Words column of Table 2</a>
