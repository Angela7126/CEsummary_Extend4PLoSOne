VTo select a parent for a mention x of type t = x e t , a simple model (as mentioned above) would be a CRP each previous mention of the same type is selected with probability proportional to 1, and u'\u005cu2662' is selected with probability proportional to u'\u005cu0391' t 0

aV\u005ctodo [author=jason,color=RedOrange,fancyline,size=,]Well, maybe they u'\u005cu2019' re exchangeable if you u'\u005cu2019' re ignoring the names at this step and just treating the types as words
p2
aV\u005ctodo [author=jason,color=RedOrange,fancyline,size=,]If we u'\u005cu2019' re using [ ] , then don u'\u005cu2019' t we have to say how u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc8e' is sampled
p3
aVThus, for fixed values of the non-mention tokens and their topics, the probability of generating the mention sequence u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc99' is proportional to the product of the probabilities of the choices in
