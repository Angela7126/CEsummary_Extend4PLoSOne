VWith the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate
p1
aVAccordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning
p2
aVSecond, even though we have no correct semantic phrase representation as the gold label, the phrases sharing the same meaning provide an indirect but feasible way
p3
aVThus, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings
p4
aVIn our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs
p5
aVAssuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings
p6
aVThe core idea behind is that a phrase and its correct translation should share the same semantic meaning
p7
aVWe can make inference from this fact that if a model can learn the same embedding for any phrase pair sharing the same meaning, the learned embedding
