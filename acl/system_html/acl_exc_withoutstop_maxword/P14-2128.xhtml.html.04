<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To show that the influence of punctuations on parsing is independent of specific parsing algorithms, we conduct experiments using three parsers, each representing a different parsing methodology the open source MSTParser 1 1 We trained a second order labelled parser with all the configurations set to the default value</a>
