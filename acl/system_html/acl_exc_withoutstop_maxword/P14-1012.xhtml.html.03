<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our semi-supervised DAE features significantly outperform the unsupervised DBN features and the baseline features, and our introduced input phrase features significantly improve the performance of DAE feature learning</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, these new m 1 + m 2 -dimensional DAE features are added as extra features to the phrase table</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, the input original features for the DBN feature learning are too simple, the limited 4 phrase features of each phrase pair, such as bidirectional phrase translation probability and bidirectional lexical weighting [ Koehn et al.2003 ] , which are a bottleneck for learning effective feature representation</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For our semi-supervised DAE feature learning task, we use the unsupervised pre-trained DBN to initialize DAE u'\u2019' s parameters and use the input original phrase features as the u'\u201c' teacher u'\u201d' for semi-supervised back-propagation</a>
