<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Instead of measuring the similarity of two concepts on the basis of their distance in the combined graph, our approach models each concept through a rich vectorial representation we refer to as semantic signature and compares the two concepts in terms of the similarity of their semantic signatures</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The definitional similarity component computes the similarity of two concepts in terms of the similarity of their definitions, a method that has also been used in previous work for aligning lexical resources [ 27 , 12 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Each of these components gets, as its input, a pair of concepts belonging to two different semantic networks and produces a similarity score</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As can be seen, the approach consists of two main components definitional similarity and structural similarity</a>
