<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Obviously the skeleton used in this work can be viewed as a simplified sentence</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As is standard in SMT, we further assume that 1) the translation process can be decomposed into a derivation of phrase-pairs (for phrase-based models) or translation rules (for syntax-based models); 2) and a linear function g u'\u2062' ( u'\u22c5' ) is used to assign a model score</a>
