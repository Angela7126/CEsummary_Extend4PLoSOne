VOne reason for this result is that projective dependency parsers satisfy the u'\u005cu201c' no crossing links u'\u005cu201d' constraint, and errors in punctuations may prevent correct word-word dependencies from being created (see section 2
p1
aVOur method distinguishes paired punctuations from other punctuations
p2
aVAs for learning, we calculate the percentage of parameter updates that are caused by associating punctuations with incorrect heads during training of the easy-first parser 3 3 For the greedy easy-first parser, whether a parameter update is caused by punctuation error can be determined with no ambiguity
p3
aVIn such cases, we simply remove these punctuations since the existence of paired punctuations already indicates that there should be a boundary

aVThe result is that more than 31 u'\u005cu2062' % of the parameter
