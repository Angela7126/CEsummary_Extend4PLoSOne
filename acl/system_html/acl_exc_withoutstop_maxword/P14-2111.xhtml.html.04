<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The principal contributions of our work are i) we show that a discriminative sequence labeling model is apt for text normalization and performs at state-of-the-art levels with small amounts of labeled training data; (ii) we show that character-level neural text embeddings can be used to effectively incorporate information from unlabeled data into the model and can substantially boost text normalization performance</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this work we suggest a simple, supervised character-level string transduction model which easily incorporates features automatically learned from large amounts of unlabeled data and needs only a limited amount of labeled training data and no lexical resources</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It also suffers from language model mismatch mentioned in Section 2 optimal results were obtained by using a low weight for the language model trained on a balanced text corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We use them to bring in information from unlabeled data into our string transduction model and then train a character-level SRN language model on unlabeled tweets</a>
