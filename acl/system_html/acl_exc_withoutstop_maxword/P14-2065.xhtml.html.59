<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Previous work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs [ 10 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Even a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2</a>
