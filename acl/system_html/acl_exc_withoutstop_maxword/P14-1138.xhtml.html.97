<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Under the recurrence, the proposed model compactly encodes the entire history of previous alignments in the hidden layer configuration y i</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, the proposed model can find alignments by taking advantage of the long alignment history, while the FFNN-based model considers only the last alignment</a>
