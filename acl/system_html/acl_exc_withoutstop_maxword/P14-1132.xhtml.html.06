<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For fast mapping, we report the mean rank of the correct concept among fast mapping candidates</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We use a set of approximately 9,500 concepts, the intersection of the ESP-based visual semantic space with the linguistic space</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For the zero-shot task we report the accuracy of retrieving the correct label among the top k neighbors from a semantic space populated with the union of seen and unseen concepts</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Table 3 presents both seen and unseen concepts corresponding to visual vectors that trigger the highest activation for a subset of hidden units</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In both tasks, the projected vector of the unseen concept is labeled with the word associated to its cosine-based nearest neighbor vector in the corresponding semantic space</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3</a>
