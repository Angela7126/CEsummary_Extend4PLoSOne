<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Citation field extraction, an instance of information extraction, is the task of segmenting and labeling research paper citation strings into their constituent parts, including authors, editors, year, journal, volume, conference venue, etc</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This task is important because citation data is often provided only in plain text; however, having an accurate structured database of bibliographic information is necessary for many scientometric tasks, such as mapping scientific sub-communities, discovering research trends, and analyzing networks of researchers</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The algorithms we present in later sections for handling soft global constraints and for learning the penalties of these constraints can be applied to general structured linear models, not just CRFs, provided we have an available algorithm for performing MAP inference</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Rather than enforcing these constraints using dual decomposition, they can be enforced directly when performing MAP inference in the CRF by modifying the dynamic program of the Viterbi algorithm to only allow valid pairs of adjacent labels</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Because our learning method drives many penalties to zero, it allows practitioners to perform u'\u2018' constraint selection, u'\u2019' in which a large number of automatically-generated candidate global constraints can be considered and automatically culled to a smaller set of useful constraints, which can be run quickly at test time</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There are multiple previous examples of augmenting chain-structured sequence models with terms capturing global relationships by expanding the chain to a more complex graphical model with non-local</a>
