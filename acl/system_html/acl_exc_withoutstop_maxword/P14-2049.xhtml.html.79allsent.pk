VThe symmetric dice prod system is as an excellent nearest neighbor system at high ranks but drops below the u'\u005cu0391' = .04 system at around rank 3500
p1
aVAll the systems show degraded nearest neighbor quality as target words grow rare, but at lower ranks, the u'\u005cu0391' = .04 nearest neighbor system fares considerably better than the symmetric u'\u005cu0391' = .50 system; the line across the bottom tracks the score of a system with randomly generated nearest neighbors
p2
aVHere, T u'\u005cu0391' , si u'\u005cu2062' ( w h , w l ) is as defined in ( 9 ), and the u'\u005cu0391' -weighted word is always the less frequent word
p3
aVFigure 2 gives the results of our nearest neighbor study on the BNC for the case of dice prod
p4
aVThus, if u'\u005cu0391' + u'\u005cu0392' = 1 , Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s ratio model becomes simply
p5
aVThe function dice prod is not well known in the word similarity literature, but in the data mining literature it is often just called Dice coefficient, because it generalized the set comparison function of Dice [ 5 ]
p6
aVBelow, we investigate asymmetric versions of all three, which we write as T u'\u005cu0391' , si u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) , defined as
p7
aVMotivated by the problem of measuring how well the distribution of one word w 1 captures the distribution of another w 2 , Weeds and Weir [ 21 ] also explore asymmetric models, expressing similarity calculations as weighted combinations of several variants of what they call precision and recall
p8
aVCiting a number of empirical studies, Tversky [ 19 ] calls symmetry directly into question, and proposes two general models that abandon symmetry
p9
aVThus, u'\u005cu0391' = .80 works best for high rank target words, because most nearest neighbor candidates are less frequent, and u'\u005cu0391' = .8 tips the balance toward the nontarget words
p10
aVso with si set to min , Equation ( 3 ) includes Equation ( 2 ) as a special case
p11
aVThus, all three of these functions are special cases of symmetric ratio models
p12
aVObserve that cosine is a special case of dice prod dice u'\u005cu2020' was introduced in Curran [ 3 ] and was the most successful function in his evaluation
p13
aV[ 9 ] , which also proposes an asymmetric similarity framework based on Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s insights
p14
aVFor example, consider comparing the 100-feature vector for dinghy to the 1000 feature vector for boat if u'\u005cu0391' is high, we give more weight to the proportion of dinghy u'\u005cu2019' s features that are shared than we give to the proportion of boat u'\u005cu2019' s features that are shared
p15
aVTo reflect natural judgments of similarity for comparisons of representations of differing sparseness, u'\u005cu0391' should be tipped toward the sparser representation
p16
aVIf in Tversky/Rosch terms, the more frequent word is also a more likely focus, then this is exactly the kind of situation in which asymmetric similarity judgments will arise
p17
aVSuppose we want to measure the semantic similarity of boat , rank 682 among the nouns in the BNC corpus studied below, which has 1057 nonzero dependency features based on 50 million words of data, with dinghy , rank 6200, which has only 113 nonzero features
p18
aVOn the other hand, when the target word is a low ranking word, a high u'\u005cu0391' weight means it never receives the highest weight, and this is disastrous, since most good candidates are higher ranking
p19
aVThe nearest neighbor problem is a rather a natural ground in which to try out ideas on asymmetry, since the nearest neighbor relation is itself not symmetrical
p20
aVThis yields the three similarity functions cited above
p21
aVChoosing u'\u005cu0391' = .9 , weights recall toward the rarer word
p22
aVIf the operation is min and w 1 u'\u005cu2062' [ f ] and w 2 u'\u005cu2062' [ f ] both contain the feature weights for f , then
p23
aVWhen u'\u005cu0391' 0.5 , sim u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w u'\u005cu2062' 2 ) is biased in favor of w 1 as the referent; When u'\u005cu0391' 0.5 , sim u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w u'\u005cu2062' 2 ) is biased in favor of w 2
p24
aVGoldstone [ 8 ] summarizes the results succinctly u'\u005cu201c' Asymmetrical similarity occurs when an object with many features is judged as less similar to a sparser object than vice versa; for example, North Korea is judged to be more like China than China is [like] North Korea u'\u005cu201d' Thus, one source of asymmetry is the comparison of sparse and dense representations
p25
aVTversky shows that many similarity judgment tasks have an inherent asymmetry; but he also argues, following Rosch [ 17 ] , that certain kinds of stimuli are more naturally used as foci or standards than others
p26
aVIf the si is min , then the two terms in the denominator are the inverses of what W W call difference-weighted precision and recall
p27
aVSome of their models are also Tverskyan ratio models
p28
aVThe graphs for the other two u'\u005cu0391' -skewed systems are nearly identical, and are not shown due to space limitations
p29
aVBelow we show that an asymmetric measure, using u'\u005cu0391' and u'\u005cu0392' biased in favor of the less frequent word, greatly improves the performance of a dependency-based vector model in capturing human similarity judgments
p30
aVW W u'\u005cu2019' s additive precision/recall models appear not to be Tversky models, since they compute separate sums for precision and recall from the f u'\u005cu2208' w 1 u'\u005cu2229' w 2 , one using w 1 u'\u005cu2062' [ f ] , and one using w 2 u'\u005cu2062' [ f ]
p31
aVIn the following sections we present data showing that the performance of a dependency-based similarity system in capturing human similarity judgments can be greatly improved with rank-bias and u'\u005cu0391' -skewing
p32
aVThe value .97 was chosen for u'\u005cu0391' because it produced the best u'\u005cu0391' -system on the MC/RG corpus
p33
aVSince lin was introduced in Lin [ 13 ] ; several different functions have born that name
p34
aVThe x-axis shows target word rank; the y-axis shows the average UKB similarity scores assigned to nearest neighbors every 50 ranks
p35
aVIf n is the number of items, then the improvement on that item is
p36
aVLike Weeds and Weir, her perspective was to calculate the effectiveness of using one distribution as a proxy for the other, a fundamentally asymmetric problem
p37
aVFor distributions q and r , Lee u'\u005cu2019' s u'\u005cu0391' -skew divergence takes the KL-divergence of a mixture of q and r from q , using the u'\u005cu0391' parameter to define the proportions in the mixture
p38
aVNext, since we are interested in generalizing from sets of features, to real-valued vectors of features, w 1 , w 2 , we define
p39
aVIt is natural to use the sparser representation as the focus in the comparison
p40
aVSo for T min , ( 9 ) can be rewritten
p41
aVIn all cases, the biased system improves on the performance of its symmetric counterpart; in the case of dice u'\u005cu2020' and dice prod , that improvement is enough for the biased system to outperform cosine, the best of the symmetric distributionally based systems
p42
aVNote that T si is just the special case of Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s ratio model ( 5 ) in which u'\u005cu0391' = 0.5 and the similarity measure is symmetric
p43
aVA key assumption of most models of similarity is that a similarity relation is symmetric
p44
aVThe target word, the word whose nearest neighbor is being found, always receives the weight 1 - u'\u005cu0391'
p45
aVThe relevance of such considerations to word similarity becomes clear when we consider that for many applications, word similarity measures need to be well-defined when comparing very frequent words with infrequent words
p46
aVFor each of 3 u'\u005cu0391' -skewed similarity systems ( T u'\u005cu0391' , si ) and cosine, we found the nearest neighbor from among BNC nouns (of any rank) for the 10,000 most frequent BNC nouns using the the dependency DB created in step 2
p47
aVTo motivate such a measure, Tversky presents experimental data with asymmetric similarity results, including similarity comparisons of countries, line drawings of faces, and letters
p48
aVTable 1 presents the Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s correlation with human judgments for Cosine, UKB, and our 3 u'\u005cu0391' -skewed models using Malt-parser based vectors applied to the combined Miller-Charles/Rubenstein-Goodenough word sets, the Wordsim 353 word set, and the Wordsim 202 word set
p49
aVFor each of the 3 rank-biased similarity systems ( R u'\u005cu0391' , si ) and cosine, we computed correlations with human judgments for the pairs in 2 standard wordsets the combined Miller-Charles/Rubenstein-Goodenough word sets [ 15 , 18 ] and the Wordsim 353 word set [ 6 ] , as well as to a subset of the Wordsim set restricted to reflect semantic similarity judgments, which we will refer to as Wordsim 201
p50
aVWe then turn to the problem of finding a word u'\u005cu2019' s nearest semantic neighbors
p51
aVThe reformulation will allow us to directly draw the connection between the ratio model and a set of similarity measures that have played key roles in the similarity literature
p52
aVWe show that u'\u005cu0391' -skewing can be used to improve the quality of nearest neighbors found for both high- and mid- frequency words
p53
aVConsider four similarity functions that have played important roles in the literature on similarity
p54
aVIn this generalized form, then, ( 1 ) becomes
p55
aVLet u'\u005cu03a3' si be a shared feature sum for operation si , as defined in Equation ( 3
p56
aVTo evaluate of the quality of the nearest neighbors pairs found in Step 4, we scored them using the Wordnet-based Personalized Pagerank system described in Agirre [ 1 ] (UKB), a non distributional WordNet based measure, and the best system in Table 1
p57
aVPlugging unit vectors into the u'\u005cu0391' -skewed version of dice prod still leaves us with a symmetric function ( cos ), whatever the value of u'\u005cu0391'
p58
aV4 4 The approximation is based on the formula for computing Spearman u'\u005cu2019' s R with no ties
p59
aVWe argue that the advantages of rank bias are tied to improved similarity estimation when comparing vectors of very different dimensionality
p60
aVThe one most directly related to a large body of word similarity work that followed is what he calls the ratio model , which defines sim u'\u005cu2062' ( a , b ) as
p61
aVFirst, since Tversky has primarily additive f in mind, we can reformulate f u'\u005cu2062' ( A u'\u005cu2229' B ) as follows
p62
aVFollowing Lee [ 11 ] , who investigates a different family of asymmetric similarity functions, we will refer to these as u'\u005cu0391' -skewed measures
p63
aVWe will investigate the three asymmetric functions defined above
p64
aVThe symmetry assumption is not, however, universal, and it is not essential to all applications of similarity, especially when it comes to modeling human similarity judgments
p65
aVWe see that the u'\u005cu0391' = .8 system is even better than the symmetric system at high ranks, but degrades much more quickly
p66
aVThis assumption is foundational for some conceptions, such as the idea of a similarity space, in which similarity is the inverse of distance; and it is deeply embedded into many of the algorithms that build on a similarity relation among objects, such as clustering algorithms
p67
aVWe define the Tversky-normalized version of u'\u005cu03a3' si , written T si , as
p68
aVThe first of each of the column pairs is a symmetric system, and the second a rank-biased variant, based on Equation ( 10
p69
aVHere si is some numerical operation on real-number feature values ( si stands for shared information
p70
aVIn fact, all can be defined in terms of u'\u005cu03a3' functions differing only in their si operation
p71
aV3 3 Interestingly, Equation ( 9 ) does not yield an asymmetric version of cosine
p72
aVTo make this concrete, let us consider a word representation in the word-as-vector paradigm [ 11 , 13 ] , using a dependency-based model
p73
aVHere A and B represent feature sets for the objects a and b respectively; the term in the numerator is a function of the set of shared features, a measure of similarity, and the last two terms in the denominator measure dissimilarity u'\u005cu0391' and u'\u005cu0392' are real-number weights; when u'\u005cu0391' u'\u005cu2260' u'\u005cu0392' , symmetry is abandoned
p74
aVThe three distinct functions in Equation 6 have a similar form
p75
aVNote the 3 of the 5 items contributing the most improvement this system were pairs with a large difference in rank
p76
aVBefore presenting these results, it will be helpful to slightly reformulate and slightly generalize Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s ratio model
p77
aVLong before Weed and Weir, Lee [ 12 ] proposed an asymmetric similarity measure as well
p78
aVTable 2 shows very similar results using the Stanford parser, demonstrating the pattern is not limited to a single parsing model
p79
aVIn Table 3 , we list the pairs whose reranking on the MC/RG dataset contributed most to the improvement of the u'\u005cu0391' = .9 system over the default u'\u005cu0391' = .5 system
p80
aVWe explain these results on the basis of the principle developed for the human correlation data
p81
aVWe parsed the BNC with the Malt Dependency parser [ 16 ] and the Stanford parser [ 10 ] , creating two dependency DBs, using basically the design in Lin [ 13 ] , with features weighted by PMI [ 2 ]
p82
aVWe define three SI operations u'\u005cu03a3' prod 2 2 u'\u005cu03a3' prod , of course, is dot product u'\u005cu03a3' min , and u'\u005cu03a3' avg as follows
p83
aVAt the level of the vector representations we are using, these are events of very different dimensionality; that is, there are ten times as many features in the representation of boat as there are in the representation of dinghy
p84
aVThe computational advantage of this reformulation is that the core similarity operation u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) is done on what is generally only a small number of shared features, and the u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w i , w i ) calculations (which we will call self-similarities), can be computed in advance
p85
aVFor all three systems, the improvement shown in raising u'\u005cu0391' from .5 to whatever the optimum is is monotonic
p86
aVThis is shown in Figure 1
p87
aVThe point is that u'\u005cu0391' -skewing always helps
p88
aVNote that sim u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) is symmetric if and only if u'\u005cu0391' = 0.5
p89
aVWe conjecture that the reason this helps is Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s principle
p90
aVJimenez et al showed the continued relevance of Tversky u'\u005cu2019' s work
p91
aVWe also will look at a rank-biased family of measures
p92
aV1 1 Paralleling ( 7 ) is Jaccard-family normalization u'\u005cu03a3' jacc u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) = u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 1 ) + u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 2 , w 2 ) - u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 ) It is easy to generalize the result from van Rijsbergen [ 20 ] for the original set-specific versions of Dice and Jaccard, and show that all of the Tversky family functions discussed above are monotonic in Jaccard
p93
aVThe version used here is the one used in Curran [ 3 ]
p94
aVThe debt owed to Tversky [ 19 ] has been made clear in the introduction
p95
aVIn the last column an approximation of the amount of correlation improvement provided by that pair ( u'\u005cu0394'
p96
aVSimilarly, u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 1 ) represents the summed feature weights of w 1 , and therefore
p97
aVThat is, T min is a weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, the so-called weighted F-measure [ 14 ]
p98
aVLess clear is the debt owed to Jimenez et al
p99
aVConversely, u'\u005cu0391' = .04 works better
p100
aVThat value is probably probably an overtrained optimum

aVThis work reported here was supported by NSF CDI grant # 1028177

aVTo see this, we divide ( 9 ) everywhere by u'\u005cu03a3' u'\u005cu2062' ( w 1 , w 2 )
