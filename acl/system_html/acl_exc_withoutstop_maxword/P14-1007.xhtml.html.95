<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus in order to match the gold annotations, we define a set of heuristics for when to count vacuous words as in scope</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We proceed with argument crawling and label crawling , which pick up \spred _the_q \slnkc 03 and \spred _german_n_1 as the \srl ARG1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our crawling rules operate on semantic representations, but the annotations are with reference to the surface string</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>By disallowing the addition of EPs to the scope if they share the label of the negation cue but are not one of its arguments, we block the head noun u'\u2019' s EP (and any EPs only reachable from it) in cases of relative clauses where the head verb inside the relative clause is negated</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, the string-based annotations also include words which the ERG treats as semantically vacuous</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Further, as the \srl ARG2 of \spred _know_v_1, we reach \spred thing and through recursive invocation we activate \spred _of_p and, in yet another level of recursion, \spred _the_q \slnkc 5760 and \spred _matter_n_of</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Furthermore, the guidelines treat relative clauses as subordinate clauses and thus negation inside a relative clause is treated as bound to that clause only,</a>
