<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Using an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Bolinger ( 1967 ) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions ( the cake is sweet ), rather than attributive constructions ( the German capital ) more frequently than objective adjectives</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A large and growing body of empirical evidence indicates clear differences between concrete concepts, such as donut or hotdog and abstract concepts, such as guilt or obesity</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Adamson ( 2000 ) proposes that more subjective adjectives typically occur furthest from the noun in multiple-modifier strings such as ( hot crossed buns</a>
