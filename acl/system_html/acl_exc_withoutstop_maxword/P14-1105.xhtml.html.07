<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Compared to our final Convote dataset, an even larger percentage of the ibc sentences exhibit no noticeable political bias</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our final balanced ibc dataset consists of 3,412 sentences (4,062 before balancing and removing neutral sentences) with a total of 13,640 annotated nodes</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To avoid conflating partisanship and ideology we create a new dataset annotated for ideological bias on the sentence and phrase level</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Because our goal is to distinguish between liberal and conservative bias, instead of the more general task of classifying sentences as u'\u201c' neutral u'\u201d' or u'\u201c' biased u'\u201d' , we filter the dataset further using dualist [ 23 ] , an active learning tool, to reduce the proportion of neutral sentences</a>
