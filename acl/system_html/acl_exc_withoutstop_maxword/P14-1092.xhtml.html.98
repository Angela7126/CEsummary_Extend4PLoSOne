<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, as in 4.3 , we compute the cosine similarity between the composite LS vectors of the question text and each marker argument (in DMM) or EDU (in DPM), and label the corresponding answer segment QSEG if this score is higher than a threshold, or OTHER otherwise</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Similar to the DMM, these features take real values obtained by averaging the cosine similarity of the arguments with the question content</a>
