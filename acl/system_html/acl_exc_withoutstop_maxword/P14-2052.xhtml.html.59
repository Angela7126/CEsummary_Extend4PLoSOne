<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The sentence tree is a tree that has words as nodes and head modifier relationships between words obtained by the dependency parser as edges</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We converted the rhetorical relations between EDUs to the relations between sentences to build the nested tree structure</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a result, we obtain a tree that represents the parent-child relations of sentences, and we can use it as a document tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The document tree is a tree that has sentences as nodes and head modifier relationships between sentences obtained by RST as edges</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We can build the nested tree by regarding each node of the document tree as a sentence tree</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>First, we represent a document as a nested tree , which is composed of two types of tree structures a document tree and a sentence tree</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We counted the number of sentences in the source document that each method used to generate a summary 5 5 Note that the number for the EDU method is not equal to selected textual units because a sentence in the source document may contain multiple EDUs</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Subtree selection selected a root in both examples that differed from the parser</a>
