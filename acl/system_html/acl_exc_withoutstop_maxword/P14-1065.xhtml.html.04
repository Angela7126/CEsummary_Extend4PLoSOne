<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In Rhetorical Structure Theory, discourse analysis involves two subtasks i ) discourse segmentation , or breaking the text into a sequence of EDUs, and ( ii ) discourse parsing , or the task of linking the units (EDUs and larger discourse units) into labeled discourse trees</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The field of automatic evaluation metrics for MT is very active, and new metrics are continuously being proposed, especially in the context of the evaluation campaigns that run as part of the Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2008-2012), and NIST Metrics for Machine Translation Challenge (MetricsMATR), among others</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In order to develop a discourse-aware evaluation metric, we first generate discourse trees for the reference and the system-translated sentences using a discourse parser, and then we measure the similarity between the two discourse trees</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We first design two discourse-aware similarity measures, which use DTs generated by a publicly-available discourse parser [] ; then, we show that they can help improve a number of MT evaluation metrics at the segment- and at the system-level in the context of the WMT11 and the WMT12 metrics shared tasks []</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Overall, from the experimental results in this section, we can conclude that discourse structure is an important information source to be taken into account in the automatic evaluation of machine translation output</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Our working hypothesis is that the similarity between the discourse structures of an automatic and of a reference translation provides additional information that can be valuable for evaluating MT systems</a>
