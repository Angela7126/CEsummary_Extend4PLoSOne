<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The co-occurrence matrix was transformed by applying a Point-wise Mutual Information weighting scheme, using the DISSECT toolkit [ Dinu et al.2013 ] , to turn the raw frequencies into weights that reflect how distinctive a collocate is for a given target word with respect to the other target words under consideration</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This result illustrates the role of type frequency in syntactic productivity a measure of density that is supported by a higher number of types makes better prediction than a measure supported by fewer types</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Along these lines, Suttle and Goldberg [ Suttle and Goldberg2011 , 1254] posit a criterion of coverage, defined as u'\u201c' the degree to which attested instances u'\u2018' cover u'\u2019' the category determined jointly by attested instances together with the target coinage u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These finding support the view that semantic density and type frequency, while they both positively influence syntactic productivity, do so in different ways density defines the necessary conditions for a new coinage to occur, while type frequency increases</a>
