VMAP inference in the model with soft constraints is performed using Soft-DD, shown in Algorithm 3
p1
aVThese are same global constraints that were used for citation field extraction in Chang et al
p2
aVThe global constraints added into the model are simply that each label only occurs once per citation
p3
aVWe now describe the families of global constraints we consider for citation extraction
p4
aVHowever, there are a number of learned constraints that are often violated on the ground truth but are still useful as soft constraints
p5
aVPairwise constraints are constraints on the counts of two labels in a citation
p6
aVIn this case, the MAP problem can be formulated as a structured linear model similar to equation ( 1 ), for which we have a MAP algorithm, but where we have imposed some additional constraints A u'\u005cu2062' y u'\u005cu2264' b that no longer allow us to use the algorithm
p7
aVInitial work in machine learning for citation extraction used Markov models with no global constraints
p8
aVUsing our new method, we are able to incorporate not only all the soft global constraints of Chang et al
p9
aVSingleton constraints ensure that each label can appear at most once in a citation
p10
aVWe consider all constraints of the forms z u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) u'\u005cu2264' 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 and z u'\u005cu2062' ( i , j ) u'\u005cu2265' 0
