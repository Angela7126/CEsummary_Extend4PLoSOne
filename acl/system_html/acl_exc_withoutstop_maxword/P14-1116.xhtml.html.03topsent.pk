VWe frame content selection as a simple classification task given a set of time-series data, decide for each template whether it should be included in a summary or not
p1
aVThe summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students
p2
aVContent selection decisions based on trends in time-series data determine the selection of the useful and important variables, which we refer to here as factors , that should be conveyed in a summary
p3
aVCollective content selection [] is similar to our proposed method in that it is a classification task that predicts the templates from the same instance simultaneously
p4
aVFor instance, classifier n was trained using the data from the 9 factors and the template decisions for templates 0 to n - 1
p5
aVThe RL system differs from the classification system in the way it performs content selection
p6
aVWe compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users
p7
aVAlgorithm adaptation approaches [] extend simple classification methods to handle ML data
p8
aVIn contrast, ML classification does not need the computation of links between the data and the templates
p9
aVThe RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification
p10
aVSecondly, for Decision Tree (with predicted history) , 29 classifiers were also trained, but this time the input included the previous decisions made by the previous classifiers (i.e., the history) as well as the set of time-series data in order to emulate the dependencies in the
