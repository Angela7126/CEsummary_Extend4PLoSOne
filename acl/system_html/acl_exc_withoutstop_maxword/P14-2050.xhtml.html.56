<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We thus expect the syntactic contexts to yield more focused embeddings, capturing more functional and less topical similarity</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper we experiment with dependency-based syntactic contexts</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The pairs are ranked according to cosine similarities between the embedded words</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Turney [ 31 ] described this distinction as domain similarity versus functional similarity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The next two examples demonstrate that similarities induced from Deps share a syntactic function (adjectives and gerunds), while similarities based on BoW are more diverse</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Optimizing this objective makes observed word-context pairs have similar embeddings, while scattering unobserved pairs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since word2vec removes the subsampled words from the corpus before creating the window contexts, this option effectively increases the window size, resulting in greater topicality</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A very common paradigm for acquiring such representations is based on the distributional hypothesis</a>
