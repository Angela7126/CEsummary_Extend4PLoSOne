<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Additionally, on top of a simpler decoder equivalent to Chiang u'\u2019' s [ 5 ] original Hiero implementation, our NNJM features are able to produce an improvement of +6.3 BLEU u'\u2013' as much as all of the other features in our strong baseline system combined</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We chose these values for the hidden layer size, vocabulary size, and source window size because they seemed to work best on our data sets u'\u2013' larger sizes did not improve results, while smaller sizes degraded results</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We also present a novel technique for training the neural network to be self-normalized , which avoids the costly step of posteriorizing over the entire vocabulary in decoding</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Specifically, if unaligned target word t is on the right edge of an arc that covers source span [ s i , s j ] , we simply say that t is affiliated with source word s j</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To do this, we first say that each target word t i is affiliated with exactly one source word at index a</a>
