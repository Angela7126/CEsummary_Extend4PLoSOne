VLater, successfully introduced WordNet classes in a dependency parser, obtaining improvements on the full PTB using gold POS tags, trying different combinations of semantic classes investigate the addition of semantic annotations in the form of word sense hypernyms, in HPSG parse ranking, reducing error rate in dependency F-score by 1%, while some methods produce substantial decreases in performance showed that fully disambiguated sense-based features smoothed using ontological information are effective for parse selection

aVClusters describe a semi-supervised approach that makes use of cluster features induced from unlabeled data, providing significant performance improvements for supervised dependency parsers on the Penn Treebank for English and the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech

aVBroadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically
