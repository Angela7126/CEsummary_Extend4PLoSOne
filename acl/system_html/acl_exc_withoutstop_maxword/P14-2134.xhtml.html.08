<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A model that can exploit all of the information in the data, learning core vector-space representations for all words along with deviations for each contextual variable, is able to learn more geographically-informed representations for this task than strict geographical models alone</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we introduce a method that extends vector-space lexical semantic models to learn representations of geographically situated language</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Backpropagation using (input x , output y ) word tuples learns the values of W (the embeddings) and X (the output parameter matrix) that maximize the likelihood of y (i.e.,, the context words) conditioned on x (i.e.,, the s i u'\u2019' s</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While the two models that include geographical information naturally outperform the model that does not, the Joint model generally far outperforms the Individual models trained on state-specific subsets of the data</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This model defines a joint parameterization over all variable values in the data, where information from data originating in California, for instance, can influence the representations learned for Wisconsin; a naive alternative would be to simply train individual models on each variable value (a u'\u201c' California u'\u201d' model using data only from California, etc</a>
