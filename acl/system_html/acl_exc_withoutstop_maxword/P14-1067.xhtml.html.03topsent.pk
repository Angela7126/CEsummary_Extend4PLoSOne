VOur results show that the sensitivity of online QE models to different distributions of training and test instances makes them more suitable than batch methods for integration in a CAT framework
p1
aVThe batch model is built by learning only from the training data and is evaluated on the test set without exploiting information from the test instances
p2
aVTo this aim, our QE models are created using a training set coming from one domain (L or IT), and then used to predict the HTER labels for the test instances coming from the other domain ( e.g., training on L, testing on IT
p3
aVThis is a strong evidence of the fact that, in case of domain changes, online models can still learn from new test instances even if they have a label distribution similar to the training set
p4
aVOn each combination of training and test sets, the batch , adaptive , and empty models are trained and evaluated in terms of global MAE scores on the test set
p5
aVEvaluation is carried out by measuring the performance of the batch (learning only from the training set), the adaptive (learning from the training set and adapting to the test set), and the empty (learning from scratch from the test set) models in terms of global MAE scores on the test set
p6
aVAs a final analysis of our results, we investigated how the performance of the different types of models ( batch , adaptive , empty ) relates to the distance between training and test sets
p7
aVOn one side, the QE models obtained with batch methods are learned exclusively from a predefined
