<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Using the Inst features alone (not shown in Table 10 ) results in a micro-average accuracy of only 58.1% these features are only useful when combined with the feature Lemma</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For predicting the aspectual class of verbs in context ( stative , dynamic , both ), we assume a supervised learning setting and explore features mined from a large background corpus, distributional features, and instance-based features</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The feature Lemma indicates that the verb u'\u2019' s lemma is used as an additional feature</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Both the LingInd and Dist features generalize across verb types, and their combination works best</a>
