<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Zha ( 2002 ) proposes the first graph-based approach for simultaneous summarization and keyphrase extraction, motivated by a key observation a sentence is important if it contains important words, and important words appear in important sentences</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Noting that candidate keyphrases that are not semantically related to the predicted keyphrases are unlikely to be keyphrases in technical reports, Turney employs coherence features to identify such candidate keyphrases</a>
