<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We adopt the best settings on development data for semi-supervised GParser with our proposed approach, and make comparison with previous results on test data</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different from traditional self/co/tri-training which only use 1-best parse trees on unlabeled data, our approach adopts ambiguous labelings, represented by parse forest, as gold-standard for unlabeled sentences</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We divide the unlabeled data into three sets according to the divergence of the 1-best outputs of Berkeley Parser and ZPar</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When the parse forests of the unlabeled data are the union of the outputs of GParser and ZPar, denoted as u'\u201c' Unlabeled u'\u2190' Z+G u'\u201d' , each word has 1.053 candidate heads on English and 1.136 on Chinese, and the oracle accuracy is higher than using 1-best outputs of single parsers (94.97% vs</a>
