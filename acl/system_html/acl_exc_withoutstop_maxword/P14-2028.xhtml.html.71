<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following given query q , pick c = arg max c E P ( c E q ) as a correction</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We tested all three methods on the u'\u201d' common u'\u201d' dataset as well to evaluate if our handling of hard cases affects the performance of our approach on the common cases of spelling error</a>
