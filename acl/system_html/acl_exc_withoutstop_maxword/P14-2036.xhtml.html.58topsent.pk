p2
aVThe experiment corresponding to Figure 2 is to discover how the classification accuracy changes when we fix the number of added words ( L = 300 ) and change the number of topics ( K ) in our method
p3
aVWe first infer the topic distribution of each microblog based on the topic-word distribution of news corpus obtained
