V1) the ontology used to evaluate the relatedness of candidates is replaced by internal links and categories from the Wikipedia corpus; 2) the coherence of entities is improved prior to the calculation of semantic relatedness using a co-reference resolution algorithm, and a NE label correction method; 3) the proposed method is robust enough to improve the performance of existing entity linking annotation engines, which are capable of providing a set of ranked candidates for each annotation in a document
p1
aVDocuments are processed by an annotator capable of producing POS tags for each word, as well as spans, NE surface forms, NE labels and ranked candidate Wikipedia URIs for each candidate NE
p2
aVThis is usually done using similarity measures (such as cosine similarity, weighted Jaccard distance, KL divergence u'\u005cu2026' ) that evaluate the distance between a bag of words related to a candidate annotation, and the words surrounding the entity to annotate in the text
p3
aVThe Mutual Disambiguation Process (MDP) relies on the graph of all the relations (internal links, categories) between Wikipedia content related to the document annotations
p4
aVOne of the classical approach to conduct the disambiguation process in NED applications is to consider the context of the mention to be mapped, and compare this context with contextual information about the potential target entities (see for instance the KIM system [ 18 ]
p5
aVA strong effort has been conducted recently by the TAC-KBP evaluation task [ 13 ] to create standardized corpus, and annotation standards based on Wikipedia for evaluation and comparison of EL systems
p6
aVSimilarly, dsr_score(URI 2 1 ) is equal to the number of times the International Business Machines Corporation is cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr page csr_score(URI 1 1 ) sums up the number of common URIs and categories between S 1 1 and S 2 1 , i.e., the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr pages csr_score(URI 2 1 ) counts the number of URIs and categories appearing in both International Business Machines Corporation and Thomas Watson, Jr pages
p7
aVWe propose a mutual disambiguation algorithm that improves the accuracy of entity links in a document by using successive corrections applied to an annotation object representing this document
p8
aVThe purpose of the MDP is to capture this semantic relatedness information contained in the graph of links extracted from Wikipedia pages related to each candidate annotation
p9
aVThe Entity Linking (EL) task consists in linking name mentions of named entities (NEs) found in a document to their corresponding entities in a reference Knowledge Base (KB
p10
aVAlternative propositions were suggested in other works like [ 10 ] that considered the relatedness of common noun phrases in a mention context with Wikipedia article names
p11
aVThe document collection built for KBP 2012 contains a combination of newswire articles (News), posts to blogs and newsgroups (Web
p12
aVFor example, if a NE describes a city name like Paris , it is more probable that the correct link for this city name designates Paris (France) rather than Paris (Texas) if a neighbor entity offers candidate links semantically related to Paris (France) like the Seine river or the Champs-Elysées
p13
aVThe study showed that they perform differently on various essential aspects of EL tasks (mention detection, linking, disambiguation
p14
aVIn MDP, for each Wikipedia URI candidate annotation, all the internal links and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related to this URI are collected
p15
aVThis generative approach does not apply to the EL task where each entity to be linked to a semantic description has a specific word context, marker of its exact identity
p16
aVBut if the IBM mention co-occurs with a Thomas Watson, Jr mention in the document, there will probably be more links between the International Business Machine and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages than between the International Brotherhood of Magicians and Thomas Watson, Jr related Wikipedia pages
p17
aVIn more recent approaches, it is suggested that annotation processes based on similarity distance measures can be improved by making use of other annotations present in the same document
p18
aVURI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris NE surface form city of Paris - The [capital of France] is easy to reach by train
p19
aVResults on categories News and Web show that the best performance on the whole KBP corpus (without distinction of NE categories) is obtained with the complete algorithm
p20
aVThe ontology (like YAGO or DBPedia) provides a pre-existing set of potential relations between the entities to link (like for instance, in our previous example, Paris (France) has_river Seine ) that will be used to rank the best candidates according to their mutual presence in the document
p21
aVTo support the correction process based on co-reference chains, the system tries to correct NE labels for all the NEs listed in the annotation object
p22
aVSome authors like Milne and Witten (2008) utilized machine learning methods rather than a similarity function to map mentions to entities
p23
aVEntity annotation and linking in natural language text has been extensively studied in NLP research
p24
aVThe proposed method is presented in Section 3 where we explain how our SemLinker system prepares documents that contain mentions to disambiguate, then we detail the disambiguation algorithm
p25
aVSurface forms consist of a word or a group of words that match lexical units like Paris or New York City
p26
aVDealing with ambiguity is one of the key difficulties in this task, since mentions are often highly polysemous, and potentially related to many different KB entries
p27
aVOn GPE and ORG entities, the simple application of MDP without prior corrections obtains the best results
p28
aVThe use of Wikipedia for explicit disambiguation dates back to [ 2 ] who built a system that compared the context of a mention to the Wikipedia categories of an entity candidate
p29
aVWhile all these approaches focus on semantic relation between entities, their potential is limited by the separate mapping of candidate links for each mention
p30
aVThe NED problem is related to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem [ 16 ] , and is often more challenging since mentions of NEs can be highly ambiguous
p31
aVFor those three categories of entities, we show that the complete system improves the performance of a simple algorithm using distance measures
p32
aVSince the system focuses on NEs, rows with lexical units that do not belong to a NE SF are dropped from the annotation object, and NE SF are refined as described in [ 5 ]
p33
aVFor each document u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , this knowledge is gathered in an array called annotation object , which has initially one row per document lexical unit
p34
aVThis research was supported as part of Dr Eric Charton u'\u005cu2019' s Mitacs Elevate Grant sponsored by 3CE
p35
aVThe reference knowledge base is derived from an October 2008 dump of English Wikipedia, which includes 818,741 nodes
p36
aVSuch techniques mostly involve exploration of graphs resulting of all the candidate annotations proposed for a given document, and try to rank the best candidates for each annotation using an ontology
p37
aVThe calculation combines two scores that we called direct semantic relation score (dsr_score) and common semantic relation score (csr_score
p38
aVIn the context of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, such resources can be generic and generative
p39
aVA slight loss of accuracy is observed on ORG NEs when the MDP is applied with corrections
p40
aVS 1 1 gathers URIs and categories contained in the International Brotherhood of Magicians Wikipedia page
p41
aVWe assumed the dsr_score was much more semantically significant than the csr_score, and translated this assumption in the weight calculation by introducing two correction parameters u'\u005cu0391' and u'\u005cu0392' used in the final scoring calculation
p42
aVThese NEs can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), etc., and they are usually represented in the KB by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI
p43
aVCandidate NE annotations for this mention can be International Business Machine or International Brotherhood of Magicians
p44
aVFor a given NE, this weight is expected to measure the mutual relations of a candidate annotation with all the other candidate annotations of NEs in the document
p45
aVIn this task, mentions of entities found in a document collection must be linked to entities in a reference KB, or to new named entities discovered in the collection
p46
aVThis URI is selected through a decision process that gives more weight to longer surface forms and frequent URIs
p47
aVThis suggests a wide range of potential improvements on many aspects of the EL task
p48
aVHence, systems that attempt to address the NED problem must include disambiguation resources
p49
aVIn this paper we explore the capabilities of a disambiguation algorithm using all the available annotation layers of NEs to improve their links
p50
aVThe Concordia Tsang Lab provided computing resources
p51
aVAmong the NEs present in the document, the ones that co-refer are identified and clustered by logical rules applied to the content of the annotation object
p52
aVEntities can be of type person (PER), organization (ORG), or geopolitical entity (GPE
p53
aVGiven a query that consists of a document with a specified name mention of an entity, the task is to determine the correct node in the reference KB for the entity, adding a new node for the entity if it is not already in the reference KB
p54
aVIt proposes a disambiguation method that combines popularity-based priors, similarity measures, and coherence
p55
aVFirst rank candidate URIs are corrected by a process that relies on co-reference chains found in the document
p56
aVParticipation of Dr Marie-Jean Meurs was supported by the Genozymes Project funded by Genome Canada Génome Québec
p57
aVThey are used as matching sequences to locate corresponding candidate entries in the KB, and then to disambiguate those candidates using similarity measures
p58
aVThe system makes use of all the semantic content stored in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' to locally improve the precision of each URI annotation in the document
p59
aVThen, for each set, NE labels are counted per type, and all the rows in a same set are updated with the most frequent NE label found in the set, i.e., all the NEs in this set are tagged with this label
p60
aVWe observe that the complete algorithm (co-references, named entity labels and MDP) provides the best results on PER NE links
p61
aVVarious approaches have been proposed to solve the named entity disambiguation (NED) problem
p62
aVMore recently, several systems have been launched as web services dedicated to EL tasks
p63
aVHence, the co-reference correction process will assign the right URI to the first NE ( URI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris ), which was wrongly linked to the actress Paris Hilton
p64
aVURI 1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki /Paris NE surface form capital of France

aVDBPedia Spotlight [ 14 ] is a system that finds mentions of DBpedia [ 1 ] resources in a textual document
p66
aVThe system with the complete disambiguation module obtained the results provided in the third column
p67
aVThe extraction of an accurate link is a process occurring after the URI annotation of NEs in the whole document
p68
aVNEs are indicated in brackets, first rank URIs and surface forms are added below the content of each sentence
p69
aVHence, in the current example, dsr_score(URI 1 1 ) is the number of occurrences of URI 1 1 in S 2 1 , namely the number of times the International Brotherhood of Magicians are cited in the Thomas Watson, Jr page
p70
aVIt uses bags of words to disambiguate semantic entities according to a cosine similarity algorithm
p71
aVWe describe below some recent approaches proposed for solving the EL task
p72
aVColumns c 1 to c l store Wikipedia URIs associated with NEs, ordered by decreasing values of likelihood
p73
aVThe idea is to evaluate in a set of candidate links which one is the most likely to be correct by taking the other links contained in the document into account
p74
aVThe annotation object is composed of information extracted from the document along with linguistic and semantic annotations as described hereafter
p75
aVThe evaluated system makes use of the Wikimeta annotation engine

aVParis - The [city of Paris] attracts millions of tourists
p77
aVThe three best results and the median from TAC-KBP 2012 systems are shown in the remaining columns for the sake of comparison
p78
aVMost of them are compliant with new emergent semantic web standards like LinkedData network
p79
aVColumn c l + 1 stores the offset of the NEs, c l + 2 stores their surface forms, c l + 3 stores the NE labels (PER, ORG, u'\u005cu2026' ), and c l + 4 stores the (vectors of) POS tags associated with the NE surface forms u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' contains all the available knowledge about the NEs found in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f'
p80
aVFinally, we discuss the obtained results, and conclude
p81
aVTable 1 presents the results obtained by the system in three configurations
p82
aVFor all i u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , n ] ] , k u'\u005cu2208' [ [ 1 , l ] ] , we build the set S i k , composed of the Wikipedia URIs and categories contained in the source Wikipedia document related to the URI stored in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' [ i ] u'\u005cu2062' [ k ] that we will refer to as URI k i to ease the reading
p83
aVThe co-reference detection is conducted using the information recorded in the annotation object
p84
aVSuch techniques are referred to as semantic relatedness [ 19 ] , collective disambiguation [ 12 ] , or joint disambiguation [ 8 ]
p85
aVThose systems have been compared with commercial ones like AlchemyAPI, Zemanta, or Open Calais in [ 9 ]
p86
aVThe NE label correction process assigns the same NE label to all the NEs associated with the same first rank URI
p87
aVWhen a co-reference chain of NEs is detected, the system assigns the same URI to all the members of the chain
p88
aVThe input of the MDP is an annotation object u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' with n rows, obtained as explained in Section 3.1
p89
aVTable 2 provides a breakdown of the queries per categories of entities, and per type of documents
p90
aVFor instance, names of places can be very common as is Paris, which refers to 26 different places in Wikipedia
p91
aVThree sentences are extracted from a document about Paris, the French capital
p92
aVThus, we consider an annotation object u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , which is an array with a row for each NE, and columns storing related knowledge

aVFor all the rows in u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' , sets of rows with identical first rank URIs are considered
p98
aVBefore being processed by the disambiguation module, u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9f' is dynamically updated by correction processes
p99
aVFor the sake of reproducibility, we applied the KBP scoring metric ( B 3 + F ) described in [ 20 ] , and we used the KBP scorer 1 1 http://www.nist.gov/tac/2013/KBP/EntityLinking/tools.html
