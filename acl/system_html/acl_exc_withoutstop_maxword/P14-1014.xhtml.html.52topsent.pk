VThe main challenge to designing the neural network structure is on the one hand, we hope that the model can take the advantage of information provided by the learned WRRBM, which reflects general properties of web texts, so that the model generalizes well in the web domain; on the other hand, we also hope to improve the model u'\u005cu2019' s discriminative power by utilizing well-established POS tagging features, such as those of Ratnaparkhi ( 1996 )
