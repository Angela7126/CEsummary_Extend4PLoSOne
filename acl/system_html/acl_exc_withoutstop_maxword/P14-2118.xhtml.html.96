<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We evaluate the potential of our adjective subjectivity features, together with noun concreteness, to predict adjective-noun semantics, based on two existing classification tasks</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We thus define adverbiability as the frequency of derived adverbial forms relative to the frequency of their base form, e.g</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their performance as predictors in a logistic regression classifying the 3,250 adjectives labelled as subjective or not in the Wilson et al</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Unlike nouns, many adjectives are inherently subjective, and the number of adjectives in texts correlates with human judgements of their subjectivity [ 12 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We therefore extract the relative frequency of occurrence in such constructions</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We consequently extract the LeftTendency of our adjectives, defined as the frequency of occurrence as the leftmost of two adjectives as a proportion of the overall frequency of occurrence in multiple-modifier strings</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Bolinger ( 1967 ) proposed that subjective adjectives occur in predicative constructions ( the cake is sweet ), rather than attributive constructions ( the German capital ) more frequently than objective adjectives</a>
