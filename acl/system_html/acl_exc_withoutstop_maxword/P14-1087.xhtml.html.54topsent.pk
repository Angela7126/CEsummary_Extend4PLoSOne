Vwhere S u'\u005cu2062' c u'\u005cu2062' o u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' ( s ) is the score of s , S is the set of sentences already selected to be in the summary from previous iterations, and R u'\u005cu2062' 2 is the predicted ROUGE-2 score of s with respect to the already selected sentences ( S u'\u005cu0393' is a weighting parameter which is empirically set to 0.9 after tuning over a development dataset u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' is the proportion of events in s which happen in the same time span as another event in any other sentence in S
p1
aVThe timelines built in the earlier temporal processing can be incorporated into this pipeline by deriving a set of features used to score sentences in Sentence Scoring , and as input to the MMR algorithm when computing similarity in Sentence Re-ordering
p2
aVThen the temporal coverage of a sentence is defined as the number of time spans between the earliest time span T u'\u005cu2062' S a and the latest time span T u'\u005cu2062' S c
p3
aVAssigning higher scores for sentences which contain events in this time span will help us to select more relevant sentences if we want a summary about the cyclone
p4
aVIn this case time span importance is able to correctly guide summary generation by favoring time spans containing events related to the actual toppling
p5
aVReferring to Figure 1
