<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Iterative correction is hill climbing in the space of possible corrections on each iteration we make a transition to the best point in the neighbourhood, i.e., to correction, that has maximal posterior probability P ( c q</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method</a>
