VA variety of high precision assumptions such as solution post typically follows a problem post [ 15 ] , solution posts are likely to be within the first few posts , solution posts are likely to have been acknowledged by the problem post author [ 3 ] , users with high authoritativeness are likely to author solutions [ 9 ] , and so on have been seen to be useful in solution identification
p1
aVAll solution identification approaches since [ 4 ] have used supervised methods that require training data in the form of labeled solution and non-solution posts
p2
aVThe common observation that most problem-solving discussion threads have a problem description in the first post has been explicitly factored into many techniques; knowing the problem/question is important for solution identification since author relations between problem and other posts provide valuable cues for solution identification

aVAs may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' S and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N

aVIn short, each solution word is assumed to be generated from the language model or the translation model (conditioned on the problem words) with a probability of u'\u005cu039b' and 1 - u'\u005cu039b' respectively, thus accounting for the correlation assumption
p5
aVAs outlined in Table 2 , each ( p , r ) pair would be assigned to one of the classes, solution or non-solution, based on whether it conforms better with the solution models (i.e.,, u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudcae' S
