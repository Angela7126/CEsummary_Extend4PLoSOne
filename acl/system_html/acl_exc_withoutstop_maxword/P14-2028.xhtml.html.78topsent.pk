VAs any local search method, iterative correction is prone to local minima, stopping before reaching the correct word
p1
aVWith that probability defined, our correction algorithm is the following given query q , pick c = arg max c E P ( c E q ) as a correction
p2
aVA common method of avoiding local minima in optimization is the simulated annealing algorithm, key ideas from which can be adapted for spelling correction task
p3
aVThese techniques can be combined with the proposed method by replacing posterior probability of single correction in our method with an estimate obtained via discriminative training method
p4
aVIn all these cases, the misspelled word contains many errors and the corresponding error model penalty cannot be compensated by the LM weight of its proper form
p5
aVwhere W is the set of all possible words, and

a.
