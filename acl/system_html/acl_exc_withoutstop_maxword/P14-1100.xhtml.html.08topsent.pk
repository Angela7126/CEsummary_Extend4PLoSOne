VWe associate each sentence with an undirected latent tree graphical model, which is a tree consisting of both observed variables (corresponding to the words in the sentence) and an additional set of latent variables that are unobserved in the data
p1
aVAs we describe below, given the tree structure, the additive tree metric property allows us to compute u'\u005cu201c' backwards u'\u005cu201d' the distances among the latent variables as a function of the distances among the observed variables
p2
aVThen, latent states are generated for each bracket, and finally, the latent states at the yield of the bracketing parse tree generate the words of the sentence (in the form of embeddings
p3
aVThis undirected latent tree is then directed via a direction mapping to give the final constituent
