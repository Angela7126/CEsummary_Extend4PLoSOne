<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Participants in conditions that showed examples ( phrases and words ) were significantly more accurate at identifying the relations than participants in the baseline condition</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our results confirm that showing examples in the form of words or phrases significantly improves the accuracy with which grammatical relationships are recognized over the standard baseline of showing the relation name with blanks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The average success rate in the baseline condition was 41%, which is significantly less accurate than words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The average success rate was 48% for phrases , which is significantly more than words</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For the non-clausal relations, there was no significant difference between phrases and words , although they were both overall significantly better than the baseline (words p=0.0063 W=6740, phrases p=0.023 W=6418.5</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The results (Figure 5 ) confirm our hypothesis</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our findings also showed that clausal relationships, which span longer distances in sentences, benefited significantly more from example phrases than either of the other treatments</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Grammatical relations are identified more accurately when shown with examples of contextualizing words or phrases than without</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Clausal relations operate over longer distances in sentences, and so it is to be expected that showing longer stretches of context would perform better in these cases; that is indeed what the results showed</a>
