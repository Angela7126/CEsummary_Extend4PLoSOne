<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Thus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter u'\u2019' s initial model to the model out of these 20 with the highest in-sample NMI</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Then, for each dataset, for rejuvenation disabled, rejuvenation based on a reservoir of size 1000, and rejuvenation based on the entire history (in turn), we perform 30 runs of the particle filter from that fixed initial model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As each token of the training data is ingested by the particle filter, we decide to insert that token into the reservoir, or not, independent of the other tokens in the current document</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The results, shown in Figure 3 , show that we can ameliorate the variance due to initialization by tuning the initial model to NMI or perplexity</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We observed previously that variance</a>
