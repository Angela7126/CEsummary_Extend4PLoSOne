VThe resulting matrix, which contains the distributional information (in 4,683 columns) for 92 verbs occurring in the hell -construction, constitutes the semantic space under consideration in this case study
p1
aVOne benefit of the distributional semantics approach is that it allows semantic similarity between words to be quantified by measuring the similarity in their distribution
p2
aVAccording to Sahlgren [ Sahlgren2008 ] , this kind of model captures to what extent words can be substituted for each other, which is a good measure of semantic similarity between verbs
p3
aVTo answer these questions, I will analyze the distribution of the construction from a semantic point of view by using a measure of semantic similarity derived from distributional information
p4
aVA wide range of distributional information can be employed in vector-based models; the present study uses the u'\u005cu2018' bag of words u'\u005cu2019' approach, which is based on the frequency of co-occurrence of words within a given context window
p5
aVAs it turns out, even this relatively coarse model captures semantic distinctions
