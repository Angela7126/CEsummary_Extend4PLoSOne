VCrucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side information to regularize a CRFs (conditional random fields) model u'\u005cu2019' s learning over treebank and bitext data, based on the posterior regularization (PR) framework [ 9 ]

aVSelf-training Segmenters (STS two variant models were defined by the approach reported in [ 20 ] that uses the supervised CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s decodings, incorporating empirical and constraint information, for unlabeled examples as additional labeled data to retrain a CRFs model

aVAn intuitive manner is to directly leverage the induced boundary distributions as label constraints to regularize segmentation model learning, based on a constrained learning algorithm

aVWord segmentation is regarded as a critical procedure for high-level Chinese language processing tasks, since Chinese scripts are written in continuous characters without explicit word
