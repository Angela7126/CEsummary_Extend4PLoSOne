<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>While most verbs have one predominant interpretation, others are more flexible for aspectual class and can occur as either stative ( 1 ) or dynamic ( 1 ) depending on the context</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our work differs from prior work in that we treat the problem as a three-way classification task, predicting dynamic , stative or both as the aspectual class of a verb in context</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For verbs with ambiguous aspectual class, type-based classification is not sufficient, as this approach selects a dominant sense for any given verb and then always assigns that</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We also include features that indicate, if there are any, the particle of the verb and its prepositional dependents</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In contrast to Siegel and McKeown ( 2000 ) , we do not conduct the task of predicting aspectual class solely at the type level, as such an approach ignores the minority class of ambiguous verbs</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Whether or not performance is improved by adding LingInd/Dist features, with their bias towards one aspectual class, depends on the verb type</a>
