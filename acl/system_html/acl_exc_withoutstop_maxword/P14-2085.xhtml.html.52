<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We aim to leverage existing, possibly noisy sets of representative stative, dynamic or mixed verb types extracted from LCS (see section 3 ), making up for unseen verbs and noise by averaging over distributional similarities</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using an existing large distributional model [ 31 ] estimated over the set of Gigaword documents marked as stories, for each verb type, we build a syntactically informed vector representing the contexts in which the verb occurs</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, we show that type-based features, including novel distributional features based on representative verbs, accurately predict predominant aspectual class for unseen verb types</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since then, it has mostly been treated as a subtask within temporal reasoning, such as in efforts related to TimeBank [ 25 ] and the TempEval challenges [ 34 , 35 , 32 ] , where top-performing systems [ 16 , 3 , 6 ] use corpus-based features, WordNet synsets, parse paths and features from typed dependencies to classify events as a joint task with determining the event u'\u2019' s span</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Using the LCS Database [ 11 ] , we identify sets of verb types whose senses are only stative (188 verbs, e.g., belong, cost, possess ), only dynamic</a>
