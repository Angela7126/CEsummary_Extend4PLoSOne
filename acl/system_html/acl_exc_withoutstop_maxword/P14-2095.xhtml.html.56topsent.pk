VOur objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification
p1
aVThe approach proposed here, which we will refer to as feature representation projection ( FRP ), constitutes an alternative to direct model transfer and annotation projection and can be seen as a compromise between the two
p2
aVThe shared feature representation for direct transfer is derived from u'\u005cu03a9' 0 by replacing language-specific part-of-speech tags with universal ones [] and adding cross-lingual word clusters [] to word types
p3
aVWe also believe that FRP may profit from using other sources of information about
