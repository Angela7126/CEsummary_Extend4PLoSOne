<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v u'\u2192' w</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this setting, we assume that our system possesses linguistic and visual information for a set of concepts in the form of text-based representations of words and image-based vectors of the corresponding objects, used for vision-to-language-mapping training</a>
