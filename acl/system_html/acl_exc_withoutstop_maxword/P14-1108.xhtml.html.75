<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Modified Kneser-Ney implements smoothing by interpolating between higher and lower order n -gram language models</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, to best of our knowledge, language models making use of skip n -grams models have never been investigated to their full extent and over different levels of lower order models</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have stopped at the 0.008 u'\u2062' % / 99.992 u'\u2062' % split as the training data set in this case consisted of less words than our 100k test sequences which we still randomly sampled from the test data of each split</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We provide a framework for using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing in combination with a systematic exploration of lower order models based on skip n -grams</a>
