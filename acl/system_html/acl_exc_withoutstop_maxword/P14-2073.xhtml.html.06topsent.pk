p5
aVHowever, in experiments on the dataset studied by Canini et al
p6
aVWe evaluate our particle filter on three datasets studied in Canini et al
p7
aVThen, for each dataset, for rejuvenation disabled, rejuvenation based on a reservoir of size 1000, and rejuvenation based on the entire history (in turn), we perform 30 runs of the particle filter from that fixed initial model
p8
aVOur results (Figure 1 ) resemble those of Canini et al
p9
aVThus we perform a set of experiments in which we perform Gibbs initialization 20 times on the initialization set, setting the particle filter u'\u005cu2019' s initial model to the model out of these 20 with the highest in-sample
