<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned in Section 3.1, the knowledge learned from the WRRBM can be investigated incrementally, using word representation , which corresponds to initializing only the projection layer of web-feature module with the projection matrix of the learned WRRBM, or ngram-level representation , which corresponds to initializing both the projection and sigmoid layers of the web-feature module by the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This can be achieved by also initializing the parameters of the second layer of the web-feature module using the position-dependent weight matrix and hidden bias of the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This can be achieved by initializing only the first layer of the web module with the projection matrix u'\ud835' u'\udc03' of the learned WRRBM</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This may partly be due to the fact that unlike computer vision tasks, the input structure of POS tagging or other sequential labelling tasks is relatively simple, and a single non-linear layer is enough to model the interactions within the input [ 27</a>
