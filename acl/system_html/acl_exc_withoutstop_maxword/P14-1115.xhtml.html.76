<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a by-product of our approach, we also propose an extractive summarization model based on phrasal queries to select the summary-worthy sentences in the conversation based on query terms and signature terms [ 17 ]</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To estimate the utterance score, we view both the query terms and the signature terms as the terms that should appear in a human query-based summary</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In order to select and extract the informative summary-worthy utterances, based on the phrasal query and the original text, we consider two criteria i) utterances should carry the essence of the original text; and ii) utterances should be relevant to the query</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Abstractive summary sentences can be created by aggregating and merging multiple sentences into an abstract sentence</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This means our systems can effectively aggregate the extracted sentences and generate abstract sentences based on the query content</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>2) We propose a novel ranking strategy to select the best path in the constructed word graph by taking the query content, overall information content and grammaticality (i.e.,, fluency) of the sentence into consideration</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this section, we show the evaluation results of our proposed framework and its comparison to the baselines and a state-of-the-art query-focused extractive summarization system</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Example 1 shows two queries and their associated human written summaries based on a single chat log</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this way, the title of each summary can be counted as a phrasal query and the corresponding summary is considered as the query-based abstract of the associated chat log including only the information most relevant to the title</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To address these issues, in this work, we tackle the task of conversation summarization based on phrasal queries</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>1) Cosine-1st we rank the utterances in the chat log based on the cosine similarity between the utterance and query</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Moreover, we compare our abstractive system with the first part of our framework (utterance extraction in Figure 1), which can be presented as</a>
