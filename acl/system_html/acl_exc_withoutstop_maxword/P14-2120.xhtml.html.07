<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>More concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given a Text Hypothesis pair, we locate a predicate-argument relationship in the Hypothesis, where both the predicate and the argument appear also in the Text, while the relationship between them is not expressed in its syntactic structure</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This task extends Semantic Role Labeling to cases in which a core argument of a predicate is missing in the syntactic structure but a filler for the corresponding semantic role appears elsewhere and can be inferred from discourse</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Two terms in the Text, candidate-predicate and candidate-argument , aligned to the Hypothesis predicate and argument, are marked as well</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>On the other hand, in some cases the candidate argument is not a DNI, but is still required in textual inference</a>
