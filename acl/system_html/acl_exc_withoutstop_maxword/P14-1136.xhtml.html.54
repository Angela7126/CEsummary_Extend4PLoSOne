<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We search for the stochastic gradient learning rate in { 0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.01 } , the margin u'\u0393' u'\u2208' { 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 } and the dimensionality of the final vector space m u'\u2208' { 256 , 512 } , to maximize the frame identification accuracy of ambiguous lexical units; by ambiguous, we imply lexical units that appear in the training data or the lexicon with more than one semantic frame</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We denote the frames that associate with u'\u2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u2113'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since the original algorithm was designed for verbs, we added a few extra rules to handle non-verbal predicates we added 1) the predicate itself as a candidate argument, 2) the span ranging from the sentence position</a>
