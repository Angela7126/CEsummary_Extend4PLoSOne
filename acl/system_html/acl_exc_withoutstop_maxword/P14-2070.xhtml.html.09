<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Compared to sentiment lexica, far less emotion lexica have been produced, and all have lower coverage</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>More recently, a resource that replicated ANEW annotation approach using crowd-sourcing, was released [] , providing sentiment scores for 14k words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The quest for a high precision and high coverage lexicon, where words are associated with either sentiment or emotion scores, has several reasons</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Interestingly, this resource annotates the most frequent words in English, so, even if lexicon coverage is still far lower than SWN-prior, it grants a high coverage, with human precision, of language use</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In recent years there has been an increasing focus on producing lists of words (lexica) with prior polarities, to be used in sentiment analysis</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Another widely used resource is ANEW [] , providing valence scores for 1k words, which were manually assigned by several annotators</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Fuzzy Affect Lexicon [] contains roughly 4k lemma#PoS manually annotated by one linguist using 80 emotion labels</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In this work, we aim at automatically producing a high coverage</a>
