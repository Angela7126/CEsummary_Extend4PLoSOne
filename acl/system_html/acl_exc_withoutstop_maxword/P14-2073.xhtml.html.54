<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the experiments of B rschinger and Johnson ( 2012 ) , the particle cloud appears to be resampled once per utterance with a large rejuvenation sequence; 4 4 The ESS threshold is P ; the rejuvenation sequence is 100 or 1600 utterances, almost one sixth of the training data each particle takes many more rejuvenation MCMC steps than new state transitions and thus resembles a batch MCMC sampler</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We may not always have labeled data for initialization, so we also consider a variation in which Gibbs initialization is performed 20 times on the first 80% of the initialization sample, held-out perplexity (per word) is estimated on the remaining 20%, using a first-moment particle learning approximation [ 20 ] , and the particle filter is started from the model out of these 20 with the lowest held-out perplexity</a>
