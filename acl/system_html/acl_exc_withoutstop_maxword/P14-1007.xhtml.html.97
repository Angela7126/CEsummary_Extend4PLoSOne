<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Scopal information in MRS analyses delivered by the ERG fixes the scope of operators u'\u2014' such as negation, modals, scopal adverbs (including subordinating conjunctions like while ), and clause-embedding verbs (e.g., believe ) u'\u2014' based on their position in the constituent structure, while leaving the scope of quantifiers (e.g., a or every , but also other determiners) free</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our system, on the other hand, models the annotation guidelines more closely in the definition of the MRS crawling rules, and has more elaborated rules for handling semantically empty words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, the MRS crawling operations u'\u2018' paint u'\u2019' a subset of the MRS graph as in-scope for a given negation cue</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our crawling rules operate on semantic representations, but the annotations are with reference to the surface string</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our MRS crawling algorithm was defined by looking at the annotated data rather than the annotation guidelines for the Shared Task [ 7 ]</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since the Shared Task gold standard annotations included such arguably semantically vacuous (see \citeNP [p.107]Bender:13) words in the scope, further heuristics are needed to repair the string-based annotations coming from the DRS-based system</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The negation cue for a negated nominal argument will appear as a quantifier EP in the MRS, triggering line 3 of our algorithm</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We combine our system with the outputs from the best-performing 2012 submission, the system of \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12, firstly by relying on the latter for system negation cue detection, 4 4 \citeA Rea:Vel:Ovr:12 predicted cues using a closed vocabulary assumption with a supervised classifier to disambiguate instances of cues and secondly as a fall-back in system combination as described in 3.4 below</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
