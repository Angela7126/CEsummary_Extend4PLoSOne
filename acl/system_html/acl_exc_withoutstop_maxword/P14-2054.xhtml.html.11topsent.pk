VSuppose x j is removed, there must be a virtual arc j - 1 u'\u005cu2192' j which is a conflict with the fact that x j is the leftmost word
p1
aVRecent studies used a subtree deletion model for compression [ 1 , 13 , 15 ] , which deletes a word only if its modifier in the parse tree is deleted
p2
aVwhere u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc33' is a binary vector, z i indicates x i is kept or not u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc32' is a square matrix denoting the projective dependency parse tree over the remaining words, y i u'\u005cu2062' j indicates if x i is the head of x j (note that each word has exactly one head w i tok is the informativeness of x i , w i u'\u005cu2062' j bgr is the score of bigram x i u'\u005cu2062' x j in an n-gram model, w dep is the score of dependency arc x i u'\u005cu2192' x j in an arc-factored dependency parsing model
p3
aVHence, the first part of the objective function is the total score of the kept
