<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u201c' derailment of train u'\u201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u201c' crash of train u'\u201d'</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Another case is when an implied predicate-argument relationship holds even though the corresponding role is already filled by another argument, hence not an NI</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Comparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since our task and dataset are novel, there is no direct baseline with which we can compare this result</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then, a human reader annotates each instance as u'\u201c' Yes u'\u201d' u'\u2013' meaning that the implied relationship indeed holds in the Text, or u'\u201c' No u'\u201d' otherwise</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The Co-occurring predicate feature estimates the probability that a document would contain a as an argument of p , given that a appears elsewhere in that document as an argument of p u'\u2032' , based on explicit predicate-argument relationships in a large corpus</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>First, some relatively complex steps of the implied SRL task are avoided in our setting, while</a>
