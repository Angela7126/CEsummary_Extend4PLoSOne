V\u005cnewcite Sun:2010:COLING details their respective theoretical strengths character-based approaches better model the internal compositional structure of words and are therefore more effective at inducing new oov words; word-based approaches are better at reproducing the words of the training lexicon and can capture information from significantly larger contextual spans

aVChinese text is written without delimiters between words; as a result, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) is an essential foundational step for many tasks in Chinese natural language processing

aVDD has been successfully applied to similar situations for combining local with global models; for example, in dependency parsing [ 9 ] , bilingual sequence tagging [ 21 ] and word alignment [ 6 ]
p3
aVDual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model
