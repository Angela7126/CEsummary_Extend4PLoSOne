<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are unaware of prior work comparing the contribution of linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors (e.g.,, source and journalist features) for factuality ratings</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Having obtained a corpus of factuality ratings, we now model the factors that drive these ratings</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This prior work also does not measure the impact of individual cues and cue classes on assessment of factuality</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Saur and Pustejovsky ( 2012 ) propose a two-dimensional factuality annotation scheme, including polarity and certainty; they then build a classifier to predict annotations of factuality from statements in FactBank</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This dataset was annotated by Mechanical Turk workers who gave ratings for the factuality of the scoped claims in each Twitter message</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, this prior work has not explored the linguistic basis of factuality judgments, which we show to depend on framing devices such as cue words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This enables us to build a predictive model of the factuality annotations, with the goal of determining the full set of relevant factors, including the predicate, the source, the journalist, and the content of the claim itself</a>
