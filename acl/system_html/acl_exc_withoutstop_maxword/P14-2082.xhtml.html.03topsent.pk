VIf a document has 2 annotators, both have to agree on the relation or it is labeled vague
p1
aVSince the annotators are forced to label all required edges, the decision to label an edge as vague instead of a defined temporal relation is critical
p2
aVWith this new process, we created a dense ordering of document events that can properly evaluate both relation identification and relation annotation
p3
aVThe annotator did not look at the pair of events, so a relation may or may not exist
p4
aVThe annotator looked at the pair of events and decided that no temporal relation exists
p5
aVThey have the densest annotation, but u'\u005cu201c' the annotator was not required to annotate all pairs of event mentions, but as many as possible u'\u005cu201d' .This paper takes a different tack to annotation by requiring annotators to label every possible pair of events/times in a given window
p6
aVEvent-DCT pairs for every event in the text (DCT is the document creation
