<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to address this problem, we propose a new model called Max-Margin Tensor Neural Network ( MMTNN ) that explicitly models the interactions between tags and context characters by exploiting tag embeddings and tensor-based transformation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>[ 15 ] modeled Chinese word segmentation as a series of classification task at each position of the sentence in which the tag score is transformed into probability using softmax function</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Previous work found that the performance can be improved by pre-training the character embeddings on large unlabeled data and using the obtained embeddings to initialize the character lookup table instead of random initialization [ 15 , 35 ]</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, given the small size of their tensor matrix, they do not have the problem of high time cost and overfitting problem as we faced in modeling a sequence labeling task like Chinese word segmentation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By introducing tensor factorization into the neural network</a>
