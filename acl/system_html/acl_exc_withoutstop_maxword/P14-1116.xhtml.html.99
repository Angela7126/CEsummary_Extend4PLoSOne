<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>RAkEL overcomes this limitation by constructing a set of LP classifiers, which are trained with different random subsets of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>RAkEL tackles this problem by constructing an ensemble of LP classifiers and training each one on a different random subset of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>RAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>ML classification achieved significantly higher accuracy, which was expected as it is a supervised learning method</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Traditional single-label classification is the task of identifying which label one new observation is associated with, by choosing from a set of labels L []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Here, we propose an alternative method that tackles the challenge of interdependent data by using multi-label (ML) classification, which is efficient in taking data dependencies into account and generating a set of labels (in our case templates) simultaneously []</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>RAkEL takes as input the following parameters</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The reduced accuracy of the classification with predicted history is due to the error in the predicted values</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Content is regarded as labels (each template represents a label) and thus the task can be thought of as a classification problem</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ensemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>LP benefits from taking into consideration label correlations, but does not perform well when trained with few examples as in our case []</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>RL is trained to optimise for this</a>
