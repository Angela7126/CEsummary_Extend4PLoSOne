<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To avoid this problem, we removed the background by using background subtraction techniques and manually selected thresholds</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, if the background of the videos is different across sign languages, then classifying the sign languages could be done with perfection by using signals from the background</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given the learned features, the feature mapping functions and a set of labeled training videos, we extract features as follows</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We call both the centroids and filters as the learned features</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Part of the other half, involving 5 signers, is used along with the other sign language videos for learning and testing classifiers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This accuracy is so high that current research has shifted to related more challenging problems language variety identification [ 26 ] , native language identification [ 24 ] and identification at the extremes of scales; many more languages, smaller training data, shorter document lengths [ 1 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The second reason for data preprocessing is to make the input size smaller and uniform</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The same holds for the rich use of non-manual articulators in sentences and the limited role of facial expressions</a>
