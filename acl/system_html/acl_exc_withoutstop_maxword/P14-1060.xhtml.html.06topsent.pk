VWe describe learning of the model parameters with fully annotated training data, as well as an approach for learning motif segmentation that requires only partial supervision
p1
aVSupervised learning
p2
aVWe briefly discuss data-driven learning of weights for features that define the motif affinity scores and penalties
p3
aVThis would involve initializing the weights prior to the semi-supervised procedure with the weights from the supervised learning model, so as to seed the semi-supervised approach with reasonable model, and use the partially annotated data to fine-tune the supervised model
p4
aVIn this section, we describe the principal features used in the segmentation model
p5
aVSection 3 describes our methodology, which consists of a frequency-driven segmentation model to partition text into semantically meaningful recurring lineal-subunits, a representation learning framework for learning new semantic embeddings based on this segmentation, and an approach to use such embeddings in downstream applications
p6
aVHowever, the supervised learning model with subsequent annealing outperforms the supervised model in terms of both precision and recall; showing the utility of the semi-supervised method when seeded with a good initial model, and the additive value of partially labeled data
p7
aVWe present a framework for extending distributional semantics to learn semantic representations of both words and phrases in terms of recurrent motifs, rather than arbitrary word tokens
p8
aVIn this section, we define our frequency-driven framework for distributional semantics in detail
p9
aVWhile the Viterbi algorithm can be used for tagging optimal state-sequences given the weights, the structured perceptron can learn optimal model weights given gold-standard sequence labels
p10
aVThe model accounts for possible segmentations of a sentence into potential motifs, and prefers recurrent and cohesive motifs through features that capture frequency-based and statistical features, as well as linguistic idiosyncracies
p11
aVWe first quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the performance of the segmentation model, and then evaluate
