VWhen T k = T r , Rand Index can be applied directly since coreference resolution reduces to a clustering problem where mentions are partitioned into clusters (entities

aVHowever, the CoNLL data sets come from OntoNotes [ 2 ] , where singleton entities are not annotated, and BLANC has a wider dynamic range on data sets with singletons [ 7 ]
p2
aVThis leads to a phenomenon where coreference systems outputting large entities are scored more favorably than those outputting small entities [ 3 ]

aVIn particular, MUC measures the degree of agreement between key coreference links (i.e.,, links among mentions within entities)
