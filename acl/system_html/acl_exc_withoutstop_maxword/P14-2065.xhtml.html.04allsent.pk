VThe limiting factor is scale with many thousands of verbs and over a hundred commonly-discussed semantic features and syntactic frames, it is not feasible for a single researcher, or even team of researchers, to check which verbs appear in which syntactic frames and carry which semantic entailments
p1
aVImportantly, the semantics listed here is not just for the verb spray but applies to all verbs from the Spray Class whenever they appear in that syntactic frame u'\u005cu2013' that is, VerbNet assumes the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p2
aVHowever, the relevant verbs make up a tiny fraction of all English verbs, and even for these verbs, the syntactic frames in question represent only a fraction of the syntactic frames available to those verbs
p3
aVThere is some set of semantic features such that verbs that share the same syntactic behavior are identical along those semantic features
p4
aVThe VerbCorner Project 3 3 http://gameswithwords.org/VerbCorner/ is devoted to collecting semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs along a comprehensive set of theoretically-relevant semantic dimension
p5
aVVerbNet and its semantic features have been used in a variety of NLP applications, such as semantic role labeling [ 18 ] , inferencing [ 20 ] , verb classification [ 8 ] , and information extraction [ 11 ]
p6
aVThat is, ideally there would be some database of semantic judgments for a comprehensive set of verbs from each syntactic class
p7
aVFor instance, annotators judged that class 18.1 verbs in the NP V NP PP.instrument entailed movement on the part of the instrument ( Sally hit the ball with the stick ) u'\u005cu2013' something not reflected in VerbNet
p8
aVPrevious work suggests that it is the semantic entailments that matter, particularly for explaining the syntactic behavior of verbs [ 10 ]
p9
aVFor instance, it is argued that verbs like break , which describe a caused change of state, can appear in both the NP V NP form ( Sally broke the vase ) and the NP V form ( The vase broke
p10
aVAs noted above, the question is not whether all verbs in the same syntactic class share the same semantic entailments
p11
aVAs such, this task provides a lower bound for how much semantic consistency one might expect within a syntactic verb class
p12
aVIn general, there has been interest in the NLP literature in using these syntactially-relevant semantic features for shallow semantic parsing (e.g.,, Giuglea and Moschitti, 2006)
p13
aVIn order to minimize unwanted effects of world knowledge, the verb u'\u005cu2019' s arguments are replaced with nonsense words or randomly chosen proper names ( Sally sprayed the dax onto the blicket
p14
aVIn Phase 1 of the project, we focused on 11 verb classes (Table 3) comprising 641 verbs and seven different semantic entailments (Table 2
p15
aVIn computational linguistics and natural language processing, some form of the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis is often included in linguistic resources and utilized in applications
p16
aVEven a single verb may have different semantic entailments when placed in different syntactic frames
p17

p18
aVImportantly, in addition to characterizing the syntactic frames associated with each class, VerbNet also characterizes the semantics of each class
p19
aVWe selected semantic features of interest based on those most commonly cited in the linguistics literature, with a particular focus on those that u'\u005cu2013' according to VerbNet u'\u005cu2013' apply to many predicates
p20
aVThe Semantic Consistency Hypothesis would be supported if, within that database, predicates with the same syntactic properties were systematically related semantically
p21
aVHowever, most theorists posit that there is a systematic relationship between the semantics of a verb and the syntactic frames in which it can appear [ 9 ]
p22
aVIndependent of the validity of that hypothesis, the semantic judgments themselves should prove useful for any study of linguistic meaning or related application
p23
aVThus, we investigate the semantics of each verb in each syntactic frame available to it (as described by VerbNet
p24
aVVerbNet suggests two syntactic frames for class 63, one of which ( NP V that S ) appears to be marginal
p25
aVCollecting data from naive subjects is even more laborious, particularly since the average Man on the Street is not necessarily equipped with metalinguistic concepts like caused change of state and propositional attitude
p26
aVMost theoretical studies report researcher judgments for only a handful of examples; how many additional examples were considered by the researcher goes unreported
p27
aVWe then considered how many verbs in each class had the same annotation in any given syntactic frame
p28
aVHere, there does appear to be a systematic semantic distinction between the two syntactic frames in each alternation, at least most of the time
p29
aVThat is, all verbs in the same class appear in the same set of syntactic frames
p30
aVIn principle, these judgments would come from naive annotators, since researchers u'\u005cu2019' intuitions about subtle judgments may be unconsciously clouded by theoretical commitments [ 4 ]
p31
aVThis is perhaps not surprising two sentences that have the same values for Physical Change, Application of Force, Physical Contact, Change of Mental State, Mental State , and Location Change are, on average, also likely to be both good or both bad
p32
aVOne significant challenge for any such project is first classifying verbs according to the syntactic frames they can appear in
p33
aVThe semantic annotation depended on syntactic frame nearly 1/4 of the time
p34
aVIntegration with VerbNet has additional benefits, since VerbNet itself is integrated with a variety of linguistic resources, such as PropBank and Penn TreeBank
p35
aVFor example, in u'\u005cu201c' Simon Says Freeze, u'\u005cu201d' a task designed to elicit judgments about movement, the Galactic Overlord (Simon) decrees u'\u005cu201c' Galactic Stay Where You Are Day, u'\u005cu201d' during which nobody is allowed to move from their current location

aVSyntactic Frame NP V NP PP destination Example Jessica sprayed the wall
p37
aVPrevious research has shown that humans find it easier to reason about real-world scenarios than make abstract judgments [ 3 ]
p38
aVSimilarly, only verbs that describe propositional attitudes, such as like , can take a that complement ( John liked that Sally broke the vase
p39
aVEach phase focuses on a small number of classes and/or semantic entailments
p40
aVThe exact semantics associated with a verb may depend on its syntactic frame
p41
aVWe next investigated whether our results support the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p42
aVVerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008; based on Levin, 1993) lists over 6,000 verbs, categorized into 280 classes according to the syntactic frames they can appear in
p43
aVVerbs vary in terms of which syntactic frames they can appear in (Table 1
p44
aVGiven the prominence of the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis in both theory and practice, one might expect that it was on firm empirical footing
p45
aVSeveral previous projects have successfully crowd-sourced linguistic annotations, such as Phrase Detectives, where volunteers have contributed 2.5 million judgments on anaphoric relations [ 16 ]
p46
aVIn the second frame, 6 verbs received the same annotation and 4 verbs received others
p47
aVAlthough evaluation of events is an important component of human psychology, to our knowledge no researcher has suggested that it is relevant for syntax
p48
aV1 1 Note that this is a simplification in that there are non-causal verbs that appear in both the NP V NP frame and the NP V frame
p49
aVFor instance, class 9.7, which comprises a couple dozen verbs, allows 7 different syntactic frames
p50
aV4 4 Note that this table was calculated based on whether the semantic feature was present or not
p51
aVThese data can be used to test the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p52
aVIn fact, annotators frequently flagged these items as ungrammatical, which is a valuable result in itself for improving VerbNet
p53
aVThis account has a natural consequence, which we dub the Semantic Consistency Hypothesis
p54
aVIn any case, to our knowledge, of the 280 syntactic verb classes listed by VerbNet, only a handful have been studied in any detail
p55
aVAs such, the VerbCorner Project is also verifying and validating the semantics currently encoded in VerbNet
p56
aVIt remains to be seen whether the items that deviate from the mode represent true differences in semantics or reflect merely noise
p57
aVIt is widely recognized that a principled relationship between syntax and semantics would have broad implications
p58
aVAs can be seen in Table 2, for every task, the modal response covered the bulk responses, ranging from a low of 72% for Evaluation to a high of 93% for Physical Contact
p59
aVIn fact, both researchers argue that a principled relationship between syntax and semantics is necessary for language to be learnable at all
p60
aVIn u'\u005cu201c' Explode on Contact, u'\u005cu201d' designed to elicit judgments about physical contact, objects and people explode when they touch one another
p61
aVFor example, suppose a class had 10 verbs and 2 frames
p62
aVVerbs such as hit and like do not describe a change of state and so cannot appear in both forms
p63
aVIn principle, this could be an unpredictable fact about the verb that must be acquired, much like the phonological form of the verb
p64
aVNote that each task is designed to elicit judgments about entailments u'\u005cu2013' things that must be true rather than are merely likely to be true
p65
aVThus, for each feature (e.g.,, movement ), we converted the metalinguistic judgment ( u'\u005cu201c' Does this verb entail movement on the part of some entity u'\u005cu201d' ) into a real-world problem
p66
aVThis has been tested with a reasonable sample of the relevant verbs and also in both children and adults [ 1 , 15 ]
p67
aV2 2 There is a long tradition of partitioning semantics into those aspects of meaning which are u'\u005cu201c' grammatically relevant u'\u005cu201d' and those which are not
p68
aVThus, at least initially, we are focusing on the 6,000+ verbs already cataloged in VerbNet
p69
aVAny opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation
p70
aVFor instance, for Application of Force , annotators determined which participant in the event was applying the force
p71
aVAs expected, consistency was lowest for Evaluation , which is not expected to necessarily correlate with syntax
p72

p73
aVWe then considered what proportion of all annotations were accounted for by the modal response a mean of 100% would indicate that there was no disagreement among annotators for any item
p74
aVFor each syntactic frame in each class, we determined the most common annotation
p75
aVNo such database exists, whether consisting of the judgments of linguists or naive annotators
p76
aVIn many cases, annotator disagreement seems to be driven by syntactic constructions that are only marginally grammatical
p77
aVVerbNet will be edited as necessary based on the empirical results
p78
aVA Good World, which investigated evaluation ( Is the event described by the verb positive or negative
p79
aVThus, calculating consistency of a class must take differing frames into account
p80
aVBelow, the term item is the unit of annotation a verb in a frame
p81
aVConversely, Gleitman (1990) has shown such a syntax-semantics relationship could solve significant problems in vocabulary acquisition
p82
aVHowever, these pilot studies involved a small number of items which were coded by all annotators
p83
aVThus Sally rolled the ball entails that somebody applied force to the ball (namely
p84
aVWhile six of these entailments were chosen from among those features widely believed to be relevant for syntax, one was not
p85
aVFor instance, Pinker (1984, 1989) has described how this correspondence could solve long-standing puzzles about how children learn syntax in the first place
p86
aVMean consistency averaged across classes is shown for each task in Table 2
p87
aVIn the first frame, 8 verbs received the same annotation and 2 received others
p88
aVThis ensures that there are meaningful intermediate results that can be disseminated prior to the completion of the entire project
p89
aVThe consistency for the class as a whole is the average across frames
p90
aVWe refer the interested reader to Pinker (1989), Jackendoff (1990), and Levin Rappaport Hovav (2005
p91
aVOne way of addressing this question is to collect additional annotations for those items that deviate from the mode
p92
aVBecause we recruited large numbers of annotators, most of whom annotated only a few items, typical measures of inter-annotator agreement such as Cohen u'\u005cu2019' s kappa are not easily calculated
p93
aVParticipants read descriptions of events and decide whether anyone violated the rule
p94
aVThe VerbCorner Project is aimed at filling that empirical gap
p95
aVThe strongest evidence comes from experimental work on several so-called alternations (the passive, causative, locative, and dative alternations
p96
aVThese frequently matched VerbNet u'\u005cu2019' s semantics, though not always
p97
aVEach task had been iteratively piloted and redesigned until inter-annotator reliability was acceptable, as described in a previous publication
p98
aVThis amplifies the impact of any VerbCorner-inspired changes to VerbNet
p99
aVIt is frequently invoked in theories of language acquisition
p100
aVFirst, we determined the annotation for each item (i.e.,, each verb/frame combination) by majority vote
p101
aVThe participant reads descriptions of events and decides whether anything has exploded
p102
aVIn all, we collected 162,564 judgments from 1,983 volunteers (Table 2

aVThis represents good performance given that the annotators were entirely untrained

aVThere are many sophisticated rubrics for calculating consistency
p112
aVWe describe in detail one such resource, VerbNet, which is highly relevant to our investigation
p113
aVInterestingly, consistency for Evaluation was nonetheless well above floor
p114
aVIt has also been employed in models of language acquisition [ 12 , 2 ]
p115
aVNote that on certain accounts, this is a strong tendency rather than a strict necessity (e.g.,, Goldberg, 1995)
p116
aVThe full data and annotations will be released in the near future and may be available now by request
p117
aVWe address the issue of scale through crowd-sourcing
p118
aVIn many cases, the data was significantly richer

aVInstead, for each item, we calculated the most common (modal) response
