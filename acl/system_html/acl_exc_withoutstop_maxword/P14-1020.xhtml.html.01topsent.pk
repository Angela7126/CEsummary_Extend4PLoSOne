VIn the coarse pass, we compute Viterbi inside and outside scores for every span
p1
aVBecause the grammar used in the coarse pass is a projection of the grammar used in the fine pass, these coarse scores correlate reasonably closely with the probabilities computed in the fine pass
p2
aVThe unpruned Viterbi computations in a fine grammar using the clustering method of Canny et al
p3
aVFigure 1 shows an overview of the approach we first parse densely with a coarse grammar and then parse sparsely with the fine grammar, skipping symbols that the coarse pass deemed sufficiently unlikely
p4
aVThus, we can use the coarse pass u'\u005cu2019' s inside and outside scores as the scaling values for the fine pass u'\u005cu2019' s scores
p5
aVWe tested our new pruning approach using an X-bar grammar as the coarse pass
p6
aVNow, when we use a coarse pruning pass, we are able to parse nearly 280 sentences per second, a 70% increase in parsing performance relative to Canny et al
p7
aVThe coarse to fine pruning approach of Petrov and Klein ( 2007 ) employs an X-bar grammar as its first pruning phase, but there is no reason why we cannot begin with a more complex
