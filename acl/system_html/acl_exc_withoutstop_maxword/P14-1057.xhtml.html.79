<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In a way, the constraint aims to counteract the arbitrary statistics inflation caused by MetaMap results and balance the weight among concepts based on the importance of the associated query aspects</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This regularization function aims to penalize the weight of concept e based on its variants as well as the concepts from other aspects</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect u'\u201c' children u'\u201d' is mapped to 2 concepts while u'\u201c' dental caries u'\u201d' is mapped to 3 concepts</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To fix the negative impact on query aspects, we could leverage the findings in the previous study [ 28 ] and regularize the weighting strategy based on the length of query aspects to favor documents covering more query aspects</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We now conduct experiments on Med11 to compare its performance with those of using average IDF and minimum IDF ones as the representative concept</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is clear that existing retrieval functions would violate</a>
