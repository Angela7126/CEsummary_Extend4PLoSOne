<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By examining sentiment compositions of negators and arguments, we model the quantitative behavior of negators in changing sentiment</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Figure 1 illustrates the effect of a common list of negators on sentiment as observed on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Figure 1 shows the distribution of the effect of negators on sentiment without considering further semantics of the arguments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Making the basic shifting model to be dependent on the negators (model 4) reduces the prediction error significantly as compared with the error of the basic shifting (model 3</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The shifting hypothesis [] , however, assumes that negators change sentiment values by a constant amount</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A different hypothesis, called the shifting hypothesis in this paper, assumes that negators change the sentiment values by a constant amount []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To understand this further, we plot in Figure 3 the behavior of different negators the x-axis is a subset of our negators and the y-axis denotes absolute shifting in sentiment values</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Data As described earlier, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank [] has manually annotated, real-valued sentiment values for all phrases in parse trees</a>
