<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Each edge e i u'\u2062' j u'\u2208' E represents a connection between v i and v j , e i u'\u2062' j = ( v i , v j ) and defines different social circles between Twitter users e.g.,, follower ( f ) , friend ( b ) , user mention ( m ) , hashtag ( h ) , reply ( y ) and retweet ( w</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The average probability estimates p u'\u039c' ( R u'\u2223' T ) are reported for every 5 tweets in a stream T = ( t 1 , u'\u2026' u'\u2062' t k ) as u'\u2211' P n ( R u'\u2223' t k ) n , where n is the total number of users with the same attribute R or D</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The model dynamically updates posterior probability estimates p ( a ( v i ) = R t k ) for a given user v i as an additional evidence t k is acquired, as defined in a general form below for any latent attribute a u'\u2062' ( v i ) u'\u2208' A given the tweets T of user v i</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Baseline User Model As input we are given a set of vertices representing users of interest v i u'\u2208' V along with feature vectors f u'\u2192' u'\u2062' ( v i ) derived from content authored by the user of interest</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, most Twitter users are less prolific than those examined in these works, and thus do not produce the thousands of tweets required to obtain their levels of accuracy e.g.,, the median number of tweets produced by a random Twitter user per day is 10</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As a result, less active users in G g u'\u2062' e u'\u2062' o just need more than 250 tweets to converge to a true 0 or 1 class</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our goal is assign to a category each user of interest v i based on f u'\u2192' u'\u2062' ( v i</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For each such user we collect recent tweets and randomly sample their immediate k = 10 neighbors from follower, friend, user mention, reply, retweet and hashtag social circles</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our goal is to classify users of interest using evidence (e.g.,, communications) from their local neighborhood u'\u2211' n f u'\u2192' t u'\u2062' [ N r u'\u2062' ( v i ) ] u'\u2261' f u'\u2192' u'\u2062' ( N r ) as Democratic or Republican</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus, for effectively classifying a given user v i it is better to take 200 tweets each from 10 neighbors rather than 2,000 tweets from the user</a>
