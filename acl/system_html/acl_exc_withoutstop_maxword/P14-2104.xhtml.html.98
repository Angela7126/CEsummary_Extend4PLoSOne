<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Besides these morphological features, we also employ latent continuous and discrete morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Korean-specific features are built upon the morphological analysis of the suffix agglutination of the current word x i</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These features are categorized as either general features, Korean-specific features, or latent morpheme representation features</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As our experiments below show, these features improve performance by dealing with sparsity issues</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Agglutinative languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish are computationally difficult due to word-form sparsity, variable word order, and the challenge of using rich morphological features</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This result showcases the computational difficulty of dealing with morphologically rich agglutinative languages</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As we discuss in Section 5</a>
