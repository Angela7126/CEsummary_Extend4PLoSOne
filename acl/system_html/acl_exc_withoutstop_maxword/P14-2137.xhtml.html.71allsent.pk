(lp0
VOut of 158 randomly chosen correct relation translation pairs we labeled, 64% has only one co-occurring entity pair, which makes EF not very effective to identify these relation translations
p1
aVUnfortunately, this approach suffers from sparsity of the common entity pairs due to the incomparability of the corpora and those entities that cannot be translated by T N
p2
aVTherefore, we leverage relation temporality , which is both orthogonal and complementary to existing efforts leveraging entity temporality [ 8 , 6 , 16 ]
p3
aVIn clear contrast, by discovering novel latent features based on temporal properties, we can increase the accuracy of both entity and relation translations
p4
aVWe measure precision, recall, and F1-score based on the returned translation pairs for each English entity as it is done in [ 11 ]
p5
aVIn addition, the lower ranked but correct relation translations also affect entity translation
p6
aVIn this section, we briefly illustrate a baseline method EF [ 11 ]
p7
aVA key contribution of this paper is using relation temporality for determining relation equivalence
p8
aVTherefore, even lower-performing EF boosted the entity translations, and in effect, our approach could achieve higher F1-score in the entity translation task
p9
aVWe can clearly see that LF†shows higher recall than EF while EF†shows higher precision
p10
aVOut of 3342 pairs, 399 are labeled as correct
p11
aVTo address this challenge, current state-of-the-art approaches build an entity graph for each language corpus, and align the two graphs by propagating the seed translation similarities (Figure 1 ) [ 7 , 17 ]
p12
aVWe compare our hybrid approach, which is denoted by LF+EF with EF [ 11 ] , a combined approach PH+SM of phonetic similarity and letter-wise semantic translation for better accuracy for organizations [ 10 ] , and the seed translations Seed that we adopt [ 17 ] with PH+SM as a base translation matrix
p13
aVIn our experiments, we use a non-selective (hence not requiring relation translations) propagation approach [ 17 ] with [ 10 ] for a base translation matrix
p14
aVSpecifically, we quantify this similarity based on the number of such common entity pairs that we denote as
p15
aVTable 3 shows the comparisons of†LF,†EF and their hybrid†LF+EF
p16
aVThus, we produce the hybrid relation translation, and we empirically set u'\u005cu039b' = 0.4
p17
aVThus, we cannot acquire any common entity pair like (Russia, aircraft carrier) for deploy and {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (deploy at
p18
aV3 3 Our results leveraging relational temporality outperforms the reported results using entity temporality on the same data set
p19
aVTo measure the effectiveness, we use a set of gold standard entity translation pairs which consist of 221 person entities and 52 organization entities
p20
aVThat is, we always {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) before we {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊâπÂáÜ (ratify) something and hence the temporal behavior of {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆ®ËÆ∫ (discuss) is also very similar to that of ratify
p21
aVAs we can see from the difference in the numbers of the documents, the news corpora are not direct translations, but they have asymmetry of entities and relations
p22
aVEach relation translation method translates an English relation r E into a list of Chinese relations, and we check whether a Chinese relation r C with the highest translation score is the correct translation
p23
aV[C3] Lastly, we have to eliminate false positives in relation temporality
p24
aVThis observation also holds in the bilingual environment by exploiting seed entity translations
p25
aVFor example, arbitrary translation pair such as (Jackie Chan, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô) can be obtained, if he is connected to his film u'\u005cu2018' Drunken Master u'\u005cu2019' ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈÜâÊã≥) in both graphs
p26
aVTherefore, we leverage corpus latent features as an additional signal to overcome this problem
p27
aVAs shown in Figure 5 , d [ e , r , * ] is more distinctive and hence a key clue to find semantically equivalent relations
p28
aVAs we emphasized in Section 3.3 , we can see their complementary property
p29
aVAdditionally, we use the following features to consider absolute frequencies f u'\u005cu2062' r u'\u005cu2062' e u'\u005cu2062' q u'\u005cu2062' ( u'\u005cu22c5' ) of textual elements as well because 1) we are more confident with more evidence and 2) in the comparable corpora, the equivalent elements are likely to show similar frequencies
p30
aVIn this section, we evaluate the proposed approach on the entity translation task and the relation translation task
p31
aV[C2] Considering entity-relation coupling distribution d [ e , r , * ] alone is not sufficient due to the domination of individual temporality
p32
aVBut in this section, we only use d [ e , r , * ] for readability
p33
aVNote that the absolute numbers (due to the harsh evaluation criteria) may look low
p34
aVThis section considers the relation translation task
p35
aVIf an entity has a peak at some period (Figure 8 ), most relations that are coupled with the entity would have a peak at the very same period (Figure 8
p36
aVHowever, not all NE translations are based on transliterations, but they might be based on semantics (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' WTO u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfs‰∏ñË¥∏ÁªÑÁªá u'\u005cu2019' [ShiMaoZuZhi]), or even arbitrary (e.g.,, u'\u005cu2018' Jackie Chan u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô u'\u005cu2019' [ChengLong]
p37
aVThat is, for ( r E , r C ) , we redefine the score as T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) / u'\u005cu2211' i u'\u005cu2208' [ 1 , k ] T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i ) where r C r u'\u005cu2062' a u'\u005cu2062' n u'\u005cu2062' k i is the i -th rank Chinese relation for r E by Equation 2
p38
aVTheir hybrid LF+EF has both high precision and recall, thus has the highest F1-score
p39
aVBased on these challenges, we identify three new features for LF
p40
aVTo address the first challenge, we use a finer-granularity unit for observing the temporality
p41
aVAs we mentioned in the introduction, traditional approaches leverage common co-occurring entity-pairs
p42
aVThe temporal similarity of the couplings, where J u'\u005cu2062' S u'\u005cu2062' D u'\u005cu2062' ( P , Q ) is the Jensen-Shannon divergence of two distributions P and Q , defined as J S D ( P , Q ) = 1 2 D ( P
p43
aVOur baseline implementation uses the one by [ 11 ] , and we refer the reader to the paper for formal definitions and processing steps we omitted due to the page limit
p44
aVWe consider the relation translation is correct when the semantics are equivalent
p45
aVThe number of English articles is 100,746, and that of Chinese articles is 88,031
p46
aVThe entity translation score obtained in the previous iteration or the seed entity translation score
p47
aVFor example, we can obtain u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d' , but not u'\u005cu201c' Russia deployed at ( {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤) an aircraft carrier u'\u005cu201d'
p48
aVTotal 3342 English-Chinese relation translation pairs returned by our method and the baselines are randomly shown and labeled
p49
aVTo illustrate the detailed effects of the corpus latent features, Table 4 shows the ranks of correct Chinese translations for English relations by methods using selected features for the challenges
p50
aVOur new hybrid approach significantly improves the relation translation (0.16 higher F1-score than EF), and in turn improves the entity translation (0.02 higher F1-score
p51
aVOn the other hand, it can be correctly translated using†EF
p52
aVFor Step 1 , an existing method for entity translation is adopted
p53
aVEF
p54
aVFormally, our goal is to build the relation translation score function T R u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) for English relation r E and Chinese relation r C
p55
aVWe identify the three big challenges in exploiting the temporality in relation translations
p56
aVFor comparison, the ranks of the correct translations when using EF are shown
p57
aVWhile Step 3 is well-defined in [ 11 ] , to propagate entity translation scores when the relation semantics of the edges are equivalent, Step 2 has been restricted to the explicit feature, i.e.,, co-occurring entities or shared context
p58
aVThe corpus explicit feature EF alone cannot translate the relation win and, in turn, u'\u005cu2018' Matthew Emmons u'\u005cu2019'
p59
aVThe focus of this paper is Step 2 , building the translation score T R ( t ) u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) of English relation r E and Chinese relation r C
p60
aVWe observe the complementary nature of EF and LF, then propose a hybrid approach combining both features
p61
aVStep 2 and Step 3 reinforce each other to improve the final entity translation function
p62
aVWe find that LF†and†EF†are complementary
p63
aVFor example, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂéª (leave for/go to) is a correct translation of leave for, but {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÁ¶ªÂºÄ (leave) is not

aVThe existence of a common entity pair using the seed entity translations (boolean
p65
aVTable 1 shows the examples of relations and their translations
p66
aVBy aggregating coupling similarities, we measure the translation score of two relations
p67
aVOur approach using the entity-relation coupling similarity feature for [C1] alone often cannot find the correct translations
p68
aVIn this section, we present our approaches to obtain relations of equivalent semantics across languages (e.g.,, visit u'\u005cu2192' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsËÆøÈóÆ
p69
aVIn this paper, we illustrate such importance using named entity (NE) translation mining problem
p70
aVIn contrast, we propose to explore corpus l atent f eatures (LF), to complement the sparsity problem of EF
p71
aVInitialize entity translation function T N ( 0 )
p72
aVIn particular, we discover three new challenges on using temporality for relation understanding in comparable corpora, which we discuss in detail in Section 3.2
p73
aVH u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C for an English relation r E and a Chinese relation r C
p74
aVWe normalize the obtained function values for each English relations using the top- k Chinese translations
p75
aVTo address this, we check the common co-occurring entity pair of the relations
p76
aVIn particular, our approach outperforms EF
p77
aV1 1 We use both d [ e , r , * ] and d [ * , r , e ] to measure the relation translation scores and leverage the average score
p78
aVFor example, Figure 5 shows the relation temporal distribution d [ visit ] ( t ) against week t
p79
aVOur proposed approach LF+EF shows higher F1-score than the baselines
p80
aVHowever, LF+EF translates him correctly into {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈ©¨‰øÆ¬∑ÂüÉËíôÊñØ through the relation win
p81
aVThat is, we can propagate the seed translation similarity of (Drunken Master, {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈÜâÊã≥) to neighbor entities u'\u005cu2018' Jackie Chan u'\u005cu2019' and u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊàêÈæô u'\u005cu2019' in each graph

aVEntity to entity-relation distribution difference (D1) and relation to entity-relation distribution difference (D2), for English and Chinese respectively

aVFor example, for a relation
p87
aVIn contrast, Lee and Hwang () propose u'\u005cu201c' selective propagation u'\u005cu201d' for asymmetric graphs, of comparing the semantics of relations
p88
aVHowever, the first relation takes [person], but the second relation [location] for the second argument
p89
aVBuild relation translation function T R ( t ) using T N ( t )
p90
aVMore specifically, we exploit a coupling of a relation and an entity d [ e , r , * ] where e is an entity, r a relation, and * is a placeholder indicating that any noun phrase is accepted for the second argument of a statement
p91
aVLF
p92
aVTable 2 shows the comparison of the methods

aVTo illustrate, two relations deploy and {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÂú® u'\u005cu2026' ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (deploy at) have similar temporal behaviors (Figure 5
p94
aVEarly research on NE translation used phonetic similarities, for example, to mine the translation u'\u005cu2018' Mandelson u'\u005cu2019' u'\u005cu2192' u'\u005cu2018' {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÊõºÂæ∑Â∞îÊ£Æ u'\u005cu2019' [ManDeErSen] with similar sounds [ 9 , 15 ]

p96
aVWe will discuss the detailed procedure of Step 2 and propose how to improve it in Section 3
p97
aVUnlike entities, we can easily observe the dissimilarity of the temporal distributions of semantically equivalent relations
p98
aVBut the top translations are still relevant (e.g.,, fight is translated to {CJK*} UTF8zhfsÈ©ª (deploy troops
p99
aVIn this section, we present experimental settings and results on translating entities using our proposed approaches
p100
aVIn general, LF†can translate more relations (e.g.,, support and capture
p101
aVStep 3 is the stage that selective propagation takes place
p102
aVThis makes all relations that appear with this entity very similar to each other regardlessly of semantics
p103
aVFor example, Figure 8 shows entity-dominating entity-relation temporality
p104
aVWe process one iteration of the entire framework ( Step 1-3 ) for both LF+EF and EF

p108
aVRepeat Step 2 and Step 3
p109
aVFor relations, such as visit, that involves diverse entities, the temporal distributions are highly noisy (Figure 5
p110
aVThe two approaches using temporality are orthogonal and can be aggregated, which we leave as our future directions
p111
aVWe compute the similarity of two relations r E in English and r C in Chinese using the following 2-steps
p112
aVCompute the translation score T R L u'\u005cu2062' F u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C ) by aggregating the coupling similarities
p113
aVFor example, u'\u005cu2018' Matthew Emmons u'\u005cu2019' is a lesser known entity, and we have only few statements mentioning him in the corpora
p114
aVSelective propagation, leveraging the statements extracted from bilingual comparable corpora, can be summarized by several steps
p115
aVHowever, in some cases like ratify, highly related relations may induce noise
p116
aVThe existing approaches are variations of using
p117
aVWhen two graphs are obtained from parallel corpora, graphs are symmetric and u'\u005cu201c' blind propagation u'\u005cu201d' described above is effective
p118
aVWith these features, we measure the similarity of a pair of couplings as follows
p119
aV[C1] Considering temporal distributions d u'\u005cu2062' [ r ] of relations alone is not sufficient
p120
aVBut using all features removes such noise
p121
aVCompute the similarity S C u'\u005cu2062' P u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C , e E , e C ) of temporal distributions of entity-relation couplings for each bilingual entity pair ( e E , e C )

aV[Base feature] f E u'\u005cu2062' T
p123
aVNote that we omit t for readability in the following sections
p124
aVTo address this challenge, we use features to measure whether d [ e , r , * ] is too close to either of d u'\u005cu2062' [ e ] or d u'\u005cu2062' [ r ]
p125
aVConsidering the three challenges, we produce a list of features { f x u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C , e E , e C ) } to measure the coupling similarity S C u'\u005cu2062' P u'\u005cu2062' ( r E , r C , e E , e C ) as follows
p126
aVWe exploit the temporal distribution d u'\u005cu2062' [ x ] u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) of textual element x during t -th week in statements; we count the occurrences of the element x on a weekly basis, and normalize them to observe u'\u005cu2211' t d u'\u005cu2062' [ x ] u'\u005cu2062' ( t ) = 1
