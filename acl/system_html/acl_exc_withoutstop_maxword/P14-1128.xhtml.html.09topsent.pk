VThe type-level word boundary distributions, induced by the character-based alignment (VES-NO-GP), and the graph propagation (VES-GP-PL), are regarded as virtual evidences to bias CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning on the unlabeled data
p1
aVAn intuitive manner is to directly leverage the induced boundary distributions as label constraints to regularize segmentation model learning, based on a constrained learning algorithm
p2
aVThe previous step contributes to generate bilingual segmentation supervisions, i.e.,, type-level word boundary distributions
p3
aVWe adopt a similarity graph to encode the learned type-level word boundary distributions
p4
aV[ 9 ] to bias the CRFs model u'\u005cu2019' s learning on unlabeled data, under a constraint encoded by the graph propagation expression
p5
aVThe GP expression constrains similar types having approximated word boundary distributions
p6
aVCrucially, the GP expression with the bilingual knowledge is then used as side
