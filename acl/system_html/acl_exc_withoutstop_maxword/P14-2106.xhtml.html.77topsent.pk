VBroadly speaking, we can classify the methods to incorporate semantic information into parsers in two systems using static lexical semantic repositories, such as WordNet or similar ontologies [] , and systems using dynamic semantic clusters automatically acquired from corpora []
p1
aVBroadly speaking, we can classify the attempts to add external knowledge to a parser in two sets using large semantic repositories such as WordNet and approaches that use information automatically acquired from corpora

aVOn the other hand, the increments are more evenly distributed for SS and clusters, and this can be due to the fact that the semantic information is orthogonal to the POS, giving similar improvements for sentences that contain or not POS errors
p3
aVAs the combination of the three baseline parsers did not give any improvement over the best single parser (ZPar), we can hypothesize that the gain coming from the parser combinations
