<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, we extract the words in the syntactic context of runs ; next, we concatenate their word embeddings as described in 2.2 to create an initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We denote the frames that associate with u'\u2113' in the frame lexicon 5 5 The frame lexicon stores the frames, corresponding semantic roles and the lexical units associated with the frame and our training corpus as F u'\u2113'</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Subsequently, we learn a mapping from this initial representation into a low-dimensional space; we also learn an embedding for each possible frame label in the same low-dimensional space</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This set of dependency paths were deemed as possible positions in the initial vector space representation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The model computes a composed representation of the predicate instance by using distributed vector representations for words (3) u'\u2013' the (red) vertical embedding vectors for each word are concatenated into a long vector</a>
