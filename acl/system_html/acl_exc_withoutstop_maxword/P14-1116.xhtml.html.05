<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>ML classification achieved significantly higher accuracy, which was expected as it is a supervised learning method</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Problem transformation approaches [] transform the ML classification task into one or more simple classification tasks</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The ML classification system performed worse than this gold standard in terms of reward, which is expected given the error in predictions (supervised methods learn to reproduce the gold standard</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>ML classification algorithms have been divided into three categories algorithm adaptation methods, problem transformation and ensemble methods []</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ensemble methods [] are algorithms that use ensembles to perform ML learning and they are based on problem transformation or algorithm adaptation methods</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>ML system, RL system, Rule-based and Random system</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The summaries generated by the ML classification system are then compared with the output of a RL system and two baseline systems in simulation and with real students</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The rule-based system and the RL system have lower accuracy compared to the ML system</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The RAndom k-labELsets (RAkEL) [] was applied in order to perform ML classification</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>RL is trained to optimise for this function, and therefore it achieves higher reward, whereas ML is trained to learn by examples, therefore it produces output closer to the gold standard (lecturer u'\u2019' s produced summaries</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Firstly, we performed a preliminary evaluation on classification methods, comparing our proposed ML classification with multiple iterated classification approaches</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The RL system differs from the classification system</a>
