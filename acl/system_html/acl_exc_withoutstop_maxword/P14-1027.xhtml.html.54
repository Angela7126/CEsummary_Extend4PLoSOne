<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>By comparing the posterior probability of two models u'\u2014' one in which function words appear at the left edges of phrases, and another in which function words appear at the right edges of phrases u'\u2014' we show that a learner could use Bayesian posterior probabilities to determine that function words appear at the left edges of phrases in English, even though they are not told the locations of word boundaries or which words are function words</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Section 4 explains how a learner could use Bayesian model selection to determine that function words appear on the left periphery in English by comparing the posterior probability of the data under our u'\u201c' function word u'\u201d' Adaptor Grammar to that obtained using a grammar which is identical except that rules ( 22 u'\u2013' 24 ) are replaced with the mirror-image rules in which u'\u201c' function words u'\u201d' are attached to the right periphery</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, the present model, initially aimed at segmenting words from continuous speech, shows three interesting characteristics that are also exhibited by human infants it distinguishes between function words and content words [] , it allows learners to acquire at least some of the function words of their language (e.g., [] ); and furthermore, it may also allow them to start grouping together function words according to their category []</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For comparison purposes we also include results for a mirror-image model that permits u'\u201c' function words u'\u201d' on the right periphery, a model which permits u'\u201c' function words u'\u201d' on both the left and right periphery (achieved by changing rules 22 u'\u2013' 24 ), as well as a model that analyses all words as monosyllabic</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experimental evidence suggests that infants as young as 8 months of age already expect function words on the correct side for their language u'\u2014' left-periphery for Italian infants and right-periphery for Japanese infants [] u'\u2014' so it is interesting to see whether purely distributional learners such as the ones studied here can identify the correct location of function words in phrases</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This suggests that there are acquisition advantages to treating function words specially that human learners could take advantage of (at least to the extent that they are learning similar generalisations as our models), and thus supports the hypothesis that function words are treated specially in human lexical acquisition</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The rule ( 3 ) models words as sequences of independently generated phones this is what called the u'\u201c' monkey model u'\u201d' of word generation (it instantiates the metaphor that word types are generated by a</a>
