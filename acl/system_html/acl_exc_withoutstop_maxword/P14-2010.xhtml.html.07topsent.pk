VAs in ClassifyLDA, we ask an annotator to assign class labels to a set of topics inferred on the unlabeled training documents
p1
aVIn this approach, a topic model on a given set of unlabeled training documents is constructed using LDA, then an annotator assigns a class label to some topics based on their most probable words
p2
aVWe then infer a set of topics on the sprinkled training documents
p3
aVC number of topics on the sprinkled dataset using collapsed Gibbs sampling, where C is the set of class labels of the training documents
p4
aVIf the annotator is unable to label a topic then we randomly select a class label from the set of all class labels
p5
aVIn our text classification algorithm, we first infer a set of topics on the given unlabeled document corpus
p6
aVWe use the labeled topics to find probability distribution of each training document over the class labels
p7
aV[] used LDA topics as features in text classification, but they use labeled documents while learning a classifier sLDA [] , DiscLDA [] and MedLDA [] are few extensions of LDA which model both class labels and words in the documents
p8
aVIn sprinkling, a set of artificial words
