<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We discard pairs of words for which the forms across languages are identical (i.e.,, the Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate pair matrice , having the same form), because these pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to be learned</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We investigate the performance of the method we propose in comparison to previous approaches for automatic detection of cognate pairs based on orthographic similarity</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Finally, we obtain 445 pairs of cognates for Romanian-French 2 2 The number of pairs of cognates is much lower for French than for the other languages because there are numerous Romanian words which have French etymology and, in this paper, we do not consider these words to be cognate candidates</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Using the best threshold value selected for each metric and pair of languages, we further classify the pairs of words in our test sets as cognates or non-cognates</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we propose a method for automatically determining pairs of cognates across languages</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We apply our method on an automatically extracted dataset of cognates for four pairs of languages</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results, we are encouraged to employ orthographic alignment for identifying pairs of cognates, not only to compute similarity scores, as was previously done, but to use aligned subsequences as features for machine learning algorithms</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For each pair of languages we determine a number of non-cognate pairs equal to the number of cognate pairs</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Because we need sets of approximately equal size for comparison across languages, we keep 400 pairs of cognates and 400 pairs of non-cognates for each pair of languages</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In Section 3 we introduce our approach for detection of cognates using orthographic alignment</a>
