<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs [ 27 ] , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs [ 5 ]</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Models were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Concreteness , the degree to which language has a perceptible physical referent, and subjectivity , the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker, are well established cognitive and linguistic notions</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u2018' pure u'\u2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Together with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks</a>
