<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Informed by studies in second language acquisition and language testing that regard these factors as key determiners of spoken language proficiency, some researchers have focused on the objective measurement of these aspects of spoken language in the context of automatic assessment of language ability</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Guided by studies in second language development, we design a measure of syntactic complexity that captures patterns indicative of proficient and non-proficient grammatical structures by a shallow-analysis of spoken language, as opposed to a deep syntactic analysis, and analyze the performance of the automatic scoring model with its inclusion</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Not surprisingly, Chen and Zechner ( 2011 ) studied measures of grammatical complexity via syntactic parsing and found that a Pearson u'\u2019' s correlation coefficient of 0.49 between syntactic complexity measures (derived from manual transcriptions) and proficiency scores, was drastically reduced to near non-existence when the measures were applied to ASR word hypotheses</a>
