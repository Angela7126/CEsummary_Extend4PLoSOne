<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our method consists of two clustering steps verb-specific semantic frames are first induced by clustering verb uses in a corpus and then verb classes are induced by clustering these frames</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To output a single class for each verb by using our proposed method, we skip the induction of verb-specific semantic frames and instead create a single frame for each verb by merging all predicate-argument structures of the verb</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We ended with 38,481 semantic frames and 699 verb classes from the Gigaword corpus, and 61,903 semantic frames and 840 verb classes from the web corpus</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Materna applied an LDA-based method to the BNC, which contains 1.4M verb uses, to induce semantic frames across verbs that can be considered to be verb classes [ 21 , 22 ]</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can use exactly the same clustering method as described in Section 3.2.3 by using semantic frames for multiple verbs as an input instead of initial frames for a single verb</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First, we make multiple data points for each verb to deal with verb polysemy (cf polysemy-aware previous studies still represented a verb as one data point [ 14 , 23 ]</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For a baseline, we use verb-specific semantic frames without clustering across verbs ( u'\u201c' S-NIL u'\u201d' and u'\u201c' SW-NIL u'\u201d' ), where these frames are considered to be verb classes but not shared across verbs</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For instance, Parisien and Stevenson applied HDP only to a small-scale child speech corpus that contains 170K verb uses</a>
