VThe effect of the measure of syntactic complexity is best studied by including it in an automatic scoring model of overall proficiency
p1
aVSubsequently, the feature extraction stage (a VSM or a MaxEnt model as the case may be) generates the syntactic complexity feature which is then incorporated in a multiple linear regression model to generate a score
p2
aVA criterion for evaluating the performance of the scoring model is the extent to which the automatic scores of overall proficiency agree with the human scores
p3
aVWe consider a multiple regression automatic scoring model as studied in Zechner et al
p4
aVAccordingly, we will summarize the previously studied model, outline its limitations, show how our proposed measure addresses those limitations and compare the two measures for the task of automatic scoring of speech
p5
aVBased on this idea, Yoon and Bhat ( 2012 ) developed a set of features of syntactic complexity based on POS sequences extracted from a large corpus of ESL learners u'\u005cu2019' spoken responses, grouped by human-assigned
