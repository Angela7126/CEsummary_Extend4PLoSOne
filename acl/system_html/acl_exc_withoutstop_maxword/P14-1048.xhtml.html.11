<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To do so, we maintain a list L to store the discourse constituents that need to be examined</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Each sentence S i , after being segmented into EDUs (not shown in the figure), goes through an intra-sentential bottom-up tree-building model M i u'\u2062' n u'\u2062' t u'\u2062' r u'\u2062' a , to form a sentence-level discourse tree T S i , with the EDUs as leaf nodes</a>
