VFirst, as the skeleton is a well-formed (but simple) sentence, all current MT approaches are applicable to the skeleton translation problem
p1
aVHowever, these approaches suffer from the same problem as the phrase-based counterpart and use the single global model to handle different translation units, no matter they are from the skeleton of the input tree/sentence or other not-so-important sub-structures
p2
aVThis model makes the skeleton translation and full translation much simpler because they perform in the same way of string translation in phrase-based MT
p3
aVHowever, using different skeleton identification results for training and inference (row 3) does not show big improvements due to the data inconsistency problem
