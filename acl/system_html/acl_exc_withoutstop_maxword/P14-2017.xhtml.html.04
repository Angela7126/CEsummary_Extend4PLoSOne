<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, we obtain 445 pairs of cognates for Romanian-French 2 2 The number of pairs of cognates is much lower for French than for the other languages because there are numerous Romanian words which have French etymology and, in this paper, we do not consider these words to be cognate candidates</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We discard pairs of words for which the forms across languages are identical (i.e.,, the Romanian word matrice and its Italian cognate pair matrice , having the same form), because these pairs do not provide any orthographic changes to be learned</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>While the purpose of cognate detection is to determine whether two given words form a cognate pair, the aim of cognate production is, given a word in a source language, to automatically produce its cognate pair in a target language</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, we compute the pairwise distances between pairs of words for each orthographic metric individually, as a single feature 5 5 SpSim cannot be computed directly, as the other metrics, so we introduce an additional step in which we use 1/3 of the training set (only cognates are needed) to learn orthographic changes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In other several research areas, such as language acquisition, bilingual word recognition [ 9 ] , corpus linguistics [ 32 ] , cross-lingual information retrieval [ 4 ] and machine translation [ 19 ] , the condition of common etymology is usually not essential and cognates are regarded as words with high cross-lingual meaning and orthographic or phonetic similarity</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, because the edit distance was widely used in this research area and produced good results,</a>
