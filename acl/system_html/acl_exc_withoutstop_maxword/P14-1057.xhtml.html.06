<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We now conduct experiments on Med11 to compare its performance with those of using average IDF and minimum IDF ones as the representative concept</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this paper, we use the maximum term IDF value from the aspect to estimate the importance, which performs better than using minimum and average IDF values as shown in the experiments (i.e.,, Table 6</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the Balanced method, we used the maximum IDF value to estimate the query importance</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In particular, for each option, we generate a plot indicating the correlation between the IDF value of a concept and the relevance probability of the concept (i.e.,, the probability that a document containing the concept is relevant</a>
