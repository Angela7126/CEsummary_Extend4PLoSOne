VSo far we have described how one applies a wide convolution, a (dynamic) k -max pooling layer and a non-linear function to the input sentence matrix to obtain a first order feature map
p1
aVIn the network the width of a feature map at an intermediate layer varies depending on the length of the input sentence; the resulting architecture is the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network
p2
aVMultiple layers of convolutional and dynamic pooling operations induce a structured feature graph over the input sentence
p3
aVIn the model, a convolutional layer of the narrow type is applied to the sentence matrix u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc2c' , where each column corresponds to the feature vector u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc30' i u'\u005cu2208' u'\u005cu211d' d of a word in the sentence
p4
aVBy adding a max pooling layer to the network, the TDNN can
