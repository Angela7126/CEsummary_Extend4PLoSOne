<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Firstly, we performed a preliminary evaluation on classification methods, comparing our proposed ML classification with multiple iterated classification approaches</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>RAkEL is based on Label Powerset (LP), a problem transformation method []</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>RAkEL tackles this problem by constructing an ensemble of LP classifiers and training each one on a different random subset of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We compared the ML system and the RL system with two baselines described below by measuring the accuracy of their outputs, the reward achieved by the reward function used for the RL system, and finally we also performed evaluation with student users</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>RAkEL overcomes this limitation by constructing a set of LP classifiers, which are trained with different random subsets of the set of labels []</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The rule-based system and the RL system have lower accuracy compared to the ML system</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The LP method transforms the ML task, into one single-label multi-class classification task, where the possible set of predicted variables for the transformed class is the powerset of labels present in the original dataset</a>
