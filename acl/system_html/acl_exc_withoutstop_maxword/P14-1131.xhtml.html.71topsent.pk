VCoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u005cu2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes
p1
aVThe cosine of two PPR vectors can be used as a similarity measure for the corresponding nodes [ 12 , 1 ]
p2
aVWe propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph
p3
aVOur key observation is that to compute the similarity of two nodes, we need not consider all other nodes in the graph as SimRank does; instead, CoSimRank starts random walks from the two nodes and computes their similarity at each time step
p4
aVApart from SimRank, extensions of PageRank are the main methods for computing the similarity of nodes in graphs in NLP (e.g.,, Hughes and Ramage ( 2007 ) , Agirre
