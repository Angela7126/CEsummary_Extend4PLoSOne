<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In this comparison, items where both fluency and adequacy were affected were counted as adequacy cases</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The table also shows that differences in the order of VP constituents usually led to a change in adequacy or fluency, as did ordering changes within NPs, with noun-noun compounds and named entities as the most frequent subcategories of NP-ordering changes</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Similarly, we conjectured that large differences in the realizer u'\u2019' s perceptron model score may more reliably reflect human fluency preferences than small ones, and thus we combined this score with features for parser accuracy in an SVM ranker</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>With wsj_0041.18, the SVM ranker unfortunately prefers a realization where presumably seems to modify shows rather than of two politicians as in the original, which the averaged perceptron model prefers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In order to gain a better understanding of the successes and failures of our SVM ranker, we present here a targeted manual analysis of the development set sentences with the greatest change in BLEU scores, carried out by the second author (a native speaker</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>With this simple reranking strategy and each of three different Treebank parsers, we find that it is possible to improve BLEU scores on Penn Treebank development data with White Rajkumar u'\u2019' s [ 28 , 36 ] baseline generative model, but not with their averaged perceptron model</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Simple ranking with the Berkeley parser of the generative model u'\u2019' s n -best realizations raised the BLEU score from 85.55 to 86.07, well below the averaged perceptron model u'\u2019' s BLEU score of 87.93</a>
