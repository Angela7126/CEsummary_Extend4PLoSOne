<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Starting with an initial candidate tree, our inference procedure climbs the scoring function in small (cheap) stochastic steps towards a high scoring parse</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We first compare our model to the Turbo parser using the Turbo parser feature set</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because the number of alternatives is small, the scoring function could in principle involve arbitrary (global) features of parse trees</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Joint Parsing and POS Correction Table 3 shows the results of joint parsing and POS correction on the CATiB dataset, for our model and state-of-the-art systems</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Baselines We compare our model with the Turbo parser and the MST parser</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>POS Tag Features In the joint POS correction scenario, we also add additional features specifically for POS prediction</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We extend our model such that it jointly learns how to predict a parse</a>
