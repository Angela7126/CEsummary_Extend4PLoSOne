<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Consider a unigram language model u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S that models the lexical characteristics of solution posts, and a translation model u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S that models the lexical correlation between problems and solutions</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In short, our approach is a 2-way clustering algorithm that uses two pairs of models, [ u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S ] and [ u'\ud835' u'\udcae' N , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' N ] , to model solution pairs and non-solution pairs respectively</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As may be obvious from the ensuing discussion, those pairs labeled as solution pairs are used to learn the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S models and those labeled as non-solution pairs are used to learn the models with subscript N</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We will use translation and language models in our method for solution identification</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our generative model models the reply part of a ( p , r ) pair (in which r is a solution) as being generated from the statistical models in { u'\ud835' u'\udcae' S , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' S } as follows</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>F u'\u2062' ( ( p , r ) , u'\ud835' u'\udcae' , u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ) indicates the conformance of the ( p , r ) pair (details in Section 4.3.1 ) with the generative model that uses the u'\ud835' u'\udcae' and u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' models as the language and translation models respectively</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We may now model the thread u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' as t - 1 post pairs, each pair having the problem post as the first element, and one of the t - 1 remaining posts (i.e.,, reply posts in u'\ud835' u'\udcaf' ) as</a>
