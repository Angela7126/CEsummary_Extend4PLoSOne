<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our objective is to make the feature representation sufficiently compact that the mapping between source and target feature spaces could be reliably estimated from a limited amount of parallel data, while preserving, insofar as possible, the information relevant for classification</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is also somewhat similar in spirit to , where a small number of word translation pairs are used to estimate a mapping between distributed representations of words in two different languages and build a word translation model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We did not tune the size of the word representation to our task, as this would not be appropriate in a cross-lingual transfer setup, but we observe that the classifier is relatively robust to their dimension when evaluated on source language u'\u2013'</a>
