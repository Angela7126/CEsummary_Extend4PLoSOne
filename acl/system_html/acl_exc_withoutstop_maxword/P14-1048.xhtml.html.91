<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>First, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In addition to efficiency, our use of a single CRF chain for all constituents can better capture the sequential dependencies among context, by taking into account the information from partially built discourse constituents, rather than bottom-level EDUs only</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As shown by Feng and Hirst ( 2012 ) , for a pair of discourse constituents of interest, the sequential information from contextual constituents is crucial for determining structures</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We have thus showed that the time complexity is linear in n , which is the number of sentences in the document</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this way, we are able to take into account the sequential information from contextual discourse constituents, which cannot be naturally represented in HILDA with SVMs as local classifiers</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As a result of successfully avoiding the expensive non-greedy parsing algorithms, our discourse parser is very efficient in practice</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>After an intra- or multi-sentential discourse tree is fully built, we perform a post-editing to consider possible modifications to the current tree, by considering useful information from the discourse constituents on upper levels, which is unavailable in the bottom-up tree-building process</a>
