<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Based on the distributional hypothesis, many methods of deriving word representations were explored in the NLP community</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The next two examples demonstrate that similarities induced from Deps share a syntactic function (adjectives and gerunds), while similarities based on BoW are more diverse</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The default approach of representing words as discrete and distinct symbols is insufficient for many tasks, and suffers from poor generalization</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The software defaults to prune rare words based on their frequency, and has an option for sub-sampling the frequent words</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Word representation is central to natural language processing</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We thus seek a representation that captures semantic and syntactic similarities between words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A very common paradigm for acquiring such representations is based on the distributional hypothesis of Harris [ 16 ] , stating that words in similar contexts</a>
