VThus, ESP constitutes a more realistic, and at the same time more challenging, simulation of how things are encountered in real life, testing the potentials of cross-modal mapping in dealing with the complex scenes that one would encounter in event recognition and caption generation tasks

aVMoreover, once the learner observes a new object, she can easily construct a full visual representation for it (and the acquisition literature has shown that humans are wired for good object segmentation and recognition [ 50 ] ) u'\u005cu2013' the more challenging task is to scan the ongoing and very ambiguous linguistic communication for contexts that might be relevant and informative about the new object
p2
aVFinally, we provide preliminary evidence that cross-modal projections can be used effectively to simulate a fast mapping scenario, thus strengthening the claims of this approach as a full-fledged, fully inductive theory of meaning acquisition
p3
aVRegarding the sources of error, a qualitative analysis of predicted word labels and objects as presented in Table 6 suggests that both textual and visual representations, although capturing relevant u'\u005cu201c' topical u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' domain u'\u005cu201d' information, are not enough to single out the properties of the target concept
p4
aVWhen the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object
p5
aVHowever, NN , an architecture that can capture more complex, non-linear relations in features across modalities, emerges as the best performing model, confirming on a larger scale the recent findings of Socher et al
p6
aVFor ESP, given the size and amount of noise in this dataset, we build vectors for visual concepts , by normalizing and summing the BoVW vectors of all the images
