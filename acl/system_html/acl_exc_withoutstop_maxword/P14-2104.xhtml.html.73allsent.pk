V2 2 http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2006T03 Our corpus is roughly similar in size to the PKPB, and taken together, the two Korean corpora now total about half the size of the Penn English PropBank
p1
aVWe have annotated semantic roles by following the PropBank annotation guideline [ 3 ] and by using frame files of the Penn Korean PropBank built by Palmer et al
p2
aVUsing coarser suffix tags can seriously degrade SRL performance, as we show in Section 6 , where we compare the performance of our model on both the new corpus and the older PKPB
p3
aVWe view our work as building on the efforts of the Penn Korean PropBank (PKPB
p4
aVThus, the Eomi and Josa categorization plays an important role in signaling semantic roles
p5
aVAs we discuss in Section 5 , we utilize these same features, but also add a set of Korean-specific features to capture aspects of Korean morphology
p6
aVFor the semantic role task, the input is a sentence consisting of a sequence of words x = x 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , x n and the output is a sequence of corresponding semantic tags y = y 1 , u'\u005cu2026' , y n
p7
aVBesides these morphological features, we also employ latent continuous and discrete morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unannotated Korean text
p8
aVKorean SRL research has been limited to domestically published Korean research on small corpora
p9
aVAgglutinative languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Turkish are computationally difficult due to word-form sparsity, variable word order, and the challenge of using rich morphological features
p10
aVIt is set to 1 if any Josa exists, otherwise 0
p11
aVAlthough both the PKPB and our corpus had improvements, the improvements were the most notable on our corpus
p12
aVKorean-specific features are built upon the morphological analysis of the suffix agglutination of the current word x i
p13
aVAs our experiments below show, these features improve performance by dealing with sparsity issues
p14
aVThese features are categorized as either general features, Korean-specific features, or latent morpheme representation features
p15
aVAlthough these are based on the general English PropBank guidelines [ 3 ] , they also differ in that we used only 4 numbered arguments from ARG0 to ARG3 instead of 5 numbered arguments
p16
aVWe thus consider 17 semantic roles in total
p17
aVThis is because PKPB POS tags might be too coarse
p18
aVSRL systems in many languages have been developed as the necessary linguistic resources become available [ 18 , 20 , 5 , 12 ]
p19
aVSeven languages were the subject of the CoNLL-2009 shared task in syntactic and semantic parsing [ 11 ]
p20
aVThe PropBank and our corpus are not exactly compatible, because the former is built on constituency-based parse trees, whereas our corpus uses dependency parses
p21
aVJosa is used to define nominal cases and modify other phrases, while Eomi is an ending of a verb or an adjective to define a tense, show an attitude, and connect or terminate a sentence
p22
aVTherefore, the most direct precedent to the present work is a section in Björkelund et al
p23
aVOur experiments will show that these finer-grained tags are crucial for achieving high SRL accuracy
p24
aVThis result showcases the computational difficulty of dealing with morphologically rich agglutinative languages
p25
aVUnlike the English models, we use individual morphemes as our unit of analysis
p26
aVEver since Gildea and Jurafsky [ 9 ] , SRL has become an important technology used in applications requiring semantic interpretation, ranging from information extraction [ 8 ] and question answering [ 14 ] , to practical problems including textual entailment [ 4 ] and pictorial communication systems [ 10 ]
p27
aVWe used this corpus to develop, train, and test our Korean SRL model
p28
aVTable 1 shows the semantic roles considered in our annotated corpus
p29
aVWe ran Kokoma Korean morpheme analyzer 4 4 http://kkma.snu.ac.kr/ on each sentence of the Donga corpus to divide words into morphemes to build latent morpheme representations
p30
aVTwo factors proved crucial in the performance of our SRL system i) The analysis of fine-grained morphological tags specific to Korean, and (ii) the use of latent stem and morpheme representations to deal with sparsity
p31
aVWe have 11 different kinds of features for the Josa (5) and Eomi (6
p32
aVBesides the contribution of this model and SRL system, we also report on the creation and availability of a new semantically annotated Korean corpus, covering over 8,000 sentences
p33
aVThe PKPB uses much coarser morpho-syntactic tags than the ETRI corpus
p34
aVWe augmented our model with all kinds of features (the last column in Table 3
p35
aVFor example, the PCA tag in PKPB used for a case suffix covers four different functioning tags used in our corpus
p36
aVFor latent morpheme representations, we used the Donga news article corpus
p37
aVA-JosaClass the linguistic classification of Josa with a total of 8 classes
p38
aVAnother linguistic classification of Eomi with a total of 4 classes
p39
aVOne advantage of our corpus is that it is built on top of the ETRI Korean corpus, which uses a richer Korean morphological tagging scheme than the Penn Korean Treebank
p40
aVFirst, the existing Korean frame files from the Penn Korean PropBank include 2,749 verbs, covering only 13.87% of all the verbs in the ETRI corpus
p41
aVIn this paper, we describe a Korean SRL system which achieves 81% labeled semantic F1-score
p42
aVKorean suffixes are traditionally classified into two groups called Josa and Eomi
p43
aVA-EomiClass_Lv1 the linguistic classification of Eomi with a total of 14 classes
p44
aVWe achieved 64.83% and 66.88% on the PKPB and our corpus
p45
aVThese features increased greatly performance improvements (3rd column in Table 3
p46
aVWe achieved 75.17%, 80.33%, and 78.61% on the PKPB, our corpus, and the combined one, respectively
p47
aVAt most five morphemes are combined to consist of one Josa in our data set
p48
aVSemantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of automatically annotating the predicate-argument structure in a sentence with semantic roles
p49
aV3 3 http://www.donga.com The Donga corpus contains 366,636 sentences with 25.09 words on average
p50
aVWe achieved our best F1-score of 81.07% over all scenarios on our corpus
p51
aVWe first tested on general features in previous work (2nd column in Table 3
p52
aVThese feature functions include transition features that identify the tag bigram ( y i - 1 , y i ) , and emission features that combine the current semantic tag ( y i ) with instantiated feature templates extracted from the sentence x and its underlying morphological and dependency analysis
p53
aVThe underlying ETRI syntactically-annotated corpus contains the dependency tree structure of sentences with morpho-syntactic tags
p54
aVThis scenario is to reveal the effects of the different latent morpheme representations (4-6th columns in Table 3
p55
aV[ 2 ] report an average labeled semantic F1-score of 80.80% across these languages
p56
aVEach morpheme composing the Josa
p57
aVConsidering the functions of Josa and Eomi, we expect that numbered roles are relevant to Josa while modifier roles are more closely related to Eomi
p58
aVWe use and modify 18 features used for Japanese from the prior work of Björkelund et al
p59
aVIn the next section, we describe the process of corpus creation in more detail
p60
aVFigure 1 displays a English/Korean sentence pair, highlighting the SOV word order of Korean as well as its rich morphological structure
p61
aVAfter 4 months of this process, the disagreement rate fell to 4% through the process of building annotation rules for Korean
p62
aVEach word consists of a stem and some number of suffix morphemes, and the semantic tags are drawn from the set { none , arg u'\u005cu2062' 0 , u'\u005cu2026' , argm-tmp }
p63
aVThe lowest reported performance is for Japanese, the only agglutinative language in their data set, achieving F1-score of 76.30%
p64
aVThe Josa itself
p65
aV1 1 http://voice.etri.re.kr/db/db_pop.asp?code=88 Our corpus was developed over two years using a specialized annotation tool [ 16 ] , resulting in more than 8,000 semantically annotated sentences
p66
aVWe categorized our experiments by the scenarios below, and all results are summarized in Table 3
p67
aVAs much as possible, annotations followed the PropBank guidelines for English [ 3 ]
p68
aVThese languages can be categorized into three broad morphological types fusional (4), analytic (2), and one agglutinative language
p69
aVAt first, each annotator assigns semantic roles independently and then they discuss to reduce disagreement of their annotation results
p70
aVThe above features are also applied to some dependency children, parents, and siblings of arguments as shown in Table 2
p71
aVA-JosaLength the number of morphemes consisting of Josa
p72
aVFor instance, the first word Poleun at the Figure 1 consists of a stem Pol plus Josa eun
p73
aVAs far as we know, this is the highest accuracy obtained for Korean, as well as any agglutinative language
p74
aVWe then added the Korean-specific morphological features to signify its appropriateness in this scenario
p75
aVWe detail the feature templates used for our experiments in Table 2
p76
aVWe annotated predicate-argument structure of verbs in a corpus from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute of Korea (ETRI
p77
aV[ 2 ] on Japanese SRL
p78
aVThey use an L 2 -regularized linear logistic regression model cascaded through these three stages, achieving F1-score of 80.80% on average for 7 languages (Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, German, Japanese and Spanish
p79
aVA-JosaExist an indicator feature checking any Josa whether or not exists in an argument
p80
aVTo alleviate the sparsity, a lingering problem in NLP, we employ three kinds of latent morpheme representations induced from a larger body of unsupervised text data
p81
aVThe first two representations are 50 dimensional continuous vectors for each morpheme, and the latter is a set of 256 clusters over morphemes
p82
aVSecondly, no Korean PropBanking guidelines have previously been published, leading to uncertainty in the initial stages of annotation
p83
aV[ 2 ] , excluding SENSE, POSITION, and re-ranker features
p84
aVSuch features have been useful in a variety of English NLP models, including chunking, named entity recognition [ 19 ] , and spoken language understanding [ 1 ]
p85
aVThe highest performance was achieved for the analytic language group (82.12%), while the agglutinative language, Japanese, yielded the lowest performance (76.30%
p86
aVThey build a classifier consisting of 3 stages predicate disambiguation, argument identification, and argument classification
p87
aVThe one exception is adverbial Josa, making the attached phrase an adverb that modifies a verb predicate
p88
aVPOS_Lv1 the first level (coarse classification) of a POS tag such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb
p89
aVWe model the conditional probability p ( y x ) using a CRF model
p90
aVThe results gave evidences that all representations increased the performance
p91
aVThe Domain of this corpus covers typical news articles such as health, entertainment, technology, politics, world and others
p92
aVWe incorporated both of these elements in a CRF [ 13 ] role labeling model
p93
aVPOS_Lv2 the second level (fine classification) of a POS tag
p94
aVFour of them are numbered roles, describing the essential arguments of a predicate
p95
aVwhere f m u'\u005cu2062' ( y i - 1 , y i , x , i ) are the feature functions
p96
aVThe other roles are called modifier roles that play more of an adjunct role
p97
aVThis research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program of the Korean National Research Foundation (NRF), and funded by the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (2010-0010612
p98
aVThe F1-score results were investigated for each scenario
p99
aVThe EomiClass_Lv1 and Lv2 are combined to display the characteristic of Eomi such as u'\u005cu2018' Nominal Transmutation Eomi u'\u005cu2019' , but not all combinations are possible
p100
aVThese are (i) linear continuous representation through Canonical Correlation Analysis [ 7 ] , (ii) non-linear continuous representation through Deep learning [ 6 ] , and (iii) discrete representation through Brown Clustering [ 17 ]
p101
aVThese 14 classes are adverbial, determinative, coordinate, exclamatory, future tense, honorific, imperative, interrogative, modesty, nominal, normal, past tense, petitionary, and subordinate
p102
aVThese three representations are from CCA, deep learning, and Brown clustering
p103
aVWhen the both corpora were combined, we had 64.86%
p104
aVBjörkelund et al
p105
aVFor all feature templates, u'\u005cu201c' A- u'\u005cu201d' or u'\u005cu201c' P- u'\u005cu201d' are used respectively to signify that the feature corresponds to the argument in question ( x i ), or rather is derived from the verbal predicate that the argument depends on
p106
aVThese classes are adverbial, auxiliary, complemental, connective, determinative, objective, subjective, and vocative
p107
aVThe four classes are closing, connection, prefinal, and transmutation
p108
aVIt includes 101,602 multiple-clause sentences with 21.66 words on average
p109
aVIf POS_Lv1 is noun , either a proper noun, common noun, or other kinds of nouns is the POS_Lv2
p110
aVInitially, the disagreement rate between two annotators was about 14%
p111
aVMore importantly, the tagsets of these corpora are not fully compatible
p112
aVWe randomly divided our data into 90% training and 10% test sets for all scenarios
p113
aVWe encountered two major difficulties during annotation
p114
aVWe used 100 iteration of averaged perceptron algorithm to train the CRF
p115
aVStem a stem without any attachment
p116
aVThe function Z is the normalizing function, which ensures that p ( y x ) is a valid probability distribution
p117
aVThese uncertainties were gradually resolved through the iterative process of resolving inter-annotator disagreements
p118
aVAll annotations were performed by two people working in a team
p119
aVCase the case type such as SBJ, OBJ, or COMP
