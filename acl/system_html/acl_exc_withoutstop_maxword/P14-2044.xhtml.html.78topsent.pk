VIn contrast, we use pairwise morphological similarity as a prior in a non-parametric clustering model
p1
aVWe can create an infinite mixture model by combining the ddCRP prior with a likelihood function defining the probability of the data given the cluster assignments
p2
aVFor each evaluation setting we provide two sets of scores u'\u005cu2014' first are the 1-1 and V-m scores for the given model, second are the comparable scores for K-means run with the same number of clusters as induced by the non-parametric model
p3
aVRecent work also shows that the combination of morphological and distributional information yields the best results, especially cross-linguistically [ 9 , 3 ]
p4
aVIn this paper we present a new approach for inducing part-of-speech (POS) classes, combining morphological and distributional information in a non-parametric Bayesian generative model based on the distance-dependent
