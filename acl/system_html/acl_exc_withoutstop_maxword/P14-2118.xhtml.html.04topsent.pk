VUsing an identical supervised learning procedure to Turney et al logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation), we test whether our lexical representations based on subjectivity and concreteness convey sufficient information to perform the same classification
p1
aVIn this paper, we show how concreteness and subjectivity can be applied together to produce performance improvements on two classification problems distinguishing literal and non-literal adjective-noun pairs [ 27 ] , and classifying the modification type exhibited by such pairs [ 5 ]
p2
aVIn addition, we analyse the effect of noun concreteness and adjective subjectivity on meaning combination, illustrating how the interaction of these dimensions enables the accurate classification of adjective-noun pairs according to their semantics
p3
aVModels were trained with concreteness features ( CONC and ExpCONC ), subjectivity features ( SUBJ and SUBJpfl ) and the combination of both types ( Combined
p4
aVConcreteness , the degree to which language has a perceptible physical referent, and subjectivity , the extent to which linguistic meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker, are well established cognitive and linguistic notions
p5
aVWe therefore extract the frequency with which concepts are tagged as adjectives relative to as nouns, on the assumption that u'\u005cu2018' pure u'\u005cu2019' adjectives are on average more subjective than nominal-style adjectives
p6
aVTogether with the practical applications outlined in Section 1, these facts indicate the potential value of concreteness for models aiming to replicate human performance in language processing tasks
p7
aVTo verify the quality of our subjectivity features, we measured their
