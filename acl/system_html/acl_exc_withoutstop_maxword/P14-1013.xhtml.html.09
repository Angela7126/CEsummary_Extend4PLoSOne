<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We evaluate the performance of our neural network based topic similarity model on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The learned neural networks are used to obtain sentence topic representations, which will be further leveraged to infer topic representations of bilingual translation rules</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>To incorporate topic representations as translation knowledge into SMT, our neural network based approach directly optimizes similarities between the source language and target language in a compact topic space</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We directly optimized bilingual topic similarity in the deep learning framework with the help of sentence-level parallel data, so that the learned representation could be easily used in SMT decoding procedure</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then, in the fine-tuning phase (Section 3.2), our model directly optimizes the similarity of two low-dimensional representations, so that it highly correlates to SMT decoding</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We incorporate the learned topic similarity scores into the standard log-linear framework for SMT</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This proves that bilingually induced topic representation with neural network helps the SMT system disambiguate translation candidates</a>
