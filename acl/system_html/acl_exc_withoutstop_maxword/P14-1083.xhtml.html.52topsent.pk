VComputer assisted translation (CAT) subsumes several modes of interaction, ranging from binary feedback on the quality of the system prediction [ Saluja et al.2012 ] , to human post-editing operations on a system prediction resulting in a reference translation [ Cesa-Bianchi et al.2008 ] , to human acceptance or overriding of sentence completion predictions [ Langlais et al.2000 , Barrachina et al.2008 , Koehn and Haddow2009 ]

aVHowever, despite offering direct and reliable prediction of translation quality, the cost and lack of reusability has confined task-based evaluations involving humans to testing scenarios, but prevented a use for interactive training of SMT systems as in our work
p2
aVComputation of distance to the reference translation usually involves cost functions based on sentence-level BLEU ( Nakov et al.2012 , inter alia ) and incorporates the current model score, leading to various ramp loss objectives described in Gimpel and Smith2012
