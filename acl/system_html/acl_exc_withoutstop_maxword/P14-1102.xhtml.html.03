<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Finally, unlike BabySRL, the model presented here provides a cognitive model of the acquisition of filler-gap comprehension, which BabySRL does not seem well-suited to model</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The 1-1 role bias error rate (before training) of the model presented in this paper is comparable to that of and , which shows that the current model provides comparable developmental modeling benefits to the BabySRL models</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This section will demonstrate that the model in this paper initially reflects 1-1 role bias comparably to BabySRL, though it progresses beyond this bias after training</a>
