VFollowing this, § 2.3 discusses a dynamic program to find maximum weight bigram subsequences from the input sentence, while § 2.4 covers LP relaxation-based approaches for approximating solutions to the problem of finding a maximum-weight subtree in a graph of potential output dependencies
p1
aVIn addition, we can recover approximate solutions to this problem by using the Chu-Liu Edmonds algorithm for recovering maximum spanning trees [ 4 , 14 ] over the relatively sparse subgraph defined by a solution to the relaxed LP
p2
aVIn order to produce a solution to this subproblem, we use an LP relaxation of the relevant portion of the ILP from Thadani and McKeown ( 2013 ) by omitting integer constraints over the token
