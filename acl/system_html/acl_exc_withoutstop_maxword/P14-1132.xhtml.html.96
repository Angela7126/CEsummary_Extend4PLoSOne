<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The zero-shot framework leads us to frame fast mapping as the task of projecting visual representations of new objects onto language space for retrieving their word labels ( v u'\u2192' w</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>When the induced projection function maps an object onto the linguistic space, the derived text vector will inherit a mixture of textual features from the concepts that activated the same hidden unit as the object</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this section, we aim at simulating a fast mapping scenario in which the learner has been just exposed to a new concept, and thus has limited linguistic evidence for that concept</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, if this is also the first linguistic encounter of that concept, then we refer to the task as fast mapping</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Concretely, we assume that concepts, denoted for convenience by word labels, are represented in linguistic terms by vectors in a text-based distributional semantic space (see Section 4.3</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The process of learning to map objects to the their word label is implemented by training a projection function f proj v u'\u2192' w from the visual onto the linguistic semantic space</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, fast mapping is often described in the psychological literature as the opposite task</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The fast mapping setting can be seen as a special case of the zero-shot task</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Whereas for the latter our system assumes that all concepts have rich linguistic representations (i.e.,, representations estimated from a large corpus), in the case of the former, new concepts are assumed to be encounted in a limited linguistic context and therefore lacking rich linguistic representations</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Furthermore, since not all new concepts in the linguistic environment refer to new objects (they might denote abstract concepts or out-of-scene objects), it seems more reasonable for the learner to be more alerted to linguistic cues about a recently-spotted new</a>
