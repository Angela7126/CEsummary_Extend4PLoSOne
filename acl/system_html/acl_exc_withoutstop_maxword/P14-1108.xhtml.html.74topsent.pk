VWe learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison
p1
aVAs the size of the training data set becomes smaller (even smaller than the evaluation data), the GLM achieves a reduction of perplexity of up to 25.7 u'\u005cu2062' % compared to language models with modified Kneser-Ney smoothing on the same data set
p2
aVHowever, to best of our knowledge, language models making use of skip n -grams models have never been investigated to their full extent and over different levels of lower order models
p3
aVOne word that appears at the end of a local context w i - n + 1 i - 1 and for which only a poor approximation exists may adversely affect the conditional probabilities in language models of all lengths u'\u005cu2014' leading to severe errors even for smoothed language models

aVWe present a large scale empirical analysis of our generalized language models on eight data sets spanning four different languages, namely, a wikipedia-based text corpus and the JRC-Acquis corpus of legislative texts
