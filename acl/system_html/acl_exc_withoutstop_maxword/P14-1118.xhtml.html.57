<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One of the challenging aspects of sentiment analysis of YouTube data is that the comments may express the sentiment not only towards the product shown in the video, but also the video itself, i.e.,, users may post positive comments to the video while being generally negative about the product and vice versa</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We go beyond traditional feature vectors by employing structural models ( STRUCT ), which encode each comment into a shallow syntactic tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>When using AUTO as a source domain, STRUCT model provides additional 1-3% of absolute improvement, except for the sentiment task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For each of the lexicons, we use the number of words found in the comment that have positive and negative sentiment as a feature</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Next, we show the learning curves to analyze the behavior of FVEC and STRUCT models according to the training size</a>
