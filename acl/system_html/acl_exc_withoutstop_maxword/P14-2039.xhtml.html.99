<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second, the fixed window alignment algorithm requires longer chunks ( u'\u2265' 10 seconds) to obtain reasonable accuracy, and thus introduces unsatisfactory latency</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Furthermore, we can see that for smaller values of the chunk size parameter, increasing the keep-length makes the system less accurate</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, at larger chunk sizes, for which there are smaller number of boundaries, the keep-length parameter has lower impact</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The chunk size directly determines the latency of the system to the end user, as alignment cannot begin until an entire chunk is captured</a>
