VS u'\u005cu2062' ( Q , D ) is the relevance score of D with respect to Q e i denotes a concept, and u'\u005cud835' u'\u005cudc9c' u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) denotes the query aspect associated with e , i.e.,, a set of concepts that are mapped to the same phrases as e by using MetaMap i u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) is the normalized confidence score of the mapping for concept e generated by MetaMap c u'\u005cu2062' ( e , D ) denotes the occurrences of concept e in document D , d u'\u005cu2062' f u'\u005cu2062' ( e ) denotes the number of documents containing e
p1
aVFor example, as shown in Figure 1 , query aspect u'\u005cu201c' children u'\u005cu201d' is mapped to 2 concepts while u'\u005cu201c' dental caries u'\u005cu201d' is mapped to 3 concepts
p2
aVThus, we use the one-to-many mapping results generated by MetaMap, in which each aspect can be mapped to multiple concepts
p3
aVFor example, as shown in Figure 1 , one aspect is mapped to two concepts while the other is mapped to three
p4
aVTo fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect
p5
aVAlthough existing retrieval functions can be directly applied to concept-based representation, they may lead to non-optimal performance
p6
aVWithin the concept-based representation, the query can then be represented as a bag of all the generated CUIs in the MetaMap
