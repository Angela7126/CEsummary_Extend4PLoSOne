<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Extractive summarization is one well-known approach to text summarization and extractive methods represent a document (or a set of documents) as a set of some textual units (e.g.,, sentences, clauses, and words) and select their subset as a summary</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The difference between the sentence subtree and the rooted sentence subtree methods was fairly small</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Our method jointly utilizes relations between sentences and relations between words, and extracts a rooted document subtree from a document tree whose nodes are arbitrary subtrees of the sentence tree</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We denote by r i u'\u2062' j the variable that is one if word i u'\u2062' j is selected as a root of an extracting sentence subtree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Let us denote by w i u'\u2062' j the term weight of word i u'\u2062' j (word j in sentence i x i is a variable that is one if sentence i is selected as part of a summary, and z i u'\u2062' j is a variable that is one if word i u'\u2062' j is selected as part of a summary</a>
