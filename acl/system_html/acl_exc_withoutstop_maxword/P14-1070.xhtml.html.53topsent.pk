VThe evaluation on u'\u005cu201c' structured representation u'\u005cu201d' can be interpreted as an evaluation of the parsing task plus the recognition of irregular MWEs only both LAS and UAS are measured independently of errors on regular MWE status (note the UAS is exactly the same than in the u'\u005cu201c' labeled u'\u005cu201d' case
p1
aVMWEs are first classified as regular or irregular, using regular expressions over the sequence of parts-of-speech within the MWE
p2
aVIRREG-BY-PARSER the MWE status, flat topology and POS are all predicted via dependency parsing, using representations for training and parsing, with all information for irregular MWEs encoded in topology and labels (as for in vain in Figure 2
p3
aVSo to sum up on the u'\u005cu201c' labeled evaluation u'\u005cu201d' , we obtain a LAS evaluation for the whole task of parsing plus MWE recognition, but an UAS evaluation that penalizes less errors on MWE status, while keeping a representation that is richer predicted parses contain not only the syntactic dependencies and
