VFigures 6 and 7 show the average distance from the convergence reward as a function of the number of episodes per epoch during training, for 4 and 5 fruits respectively
p1
aVThus, when converging to the maximum total utility solution, in the case of 4 fruits (4 apples and 4 oranges), the average reward of the two agents should be 1200 minus 10 for making or accepting an offer
p2
aVGiven that Agent 1 is more interested in apples and Agent 2 cares more about oranges, the maximum total utility solution would be the case where each agent offers to get all the fruits it cares about and to give its interlocutor all the fruits it does not care about, and the other agent accepts this offer
p3
aVThis is to make all graphs comparable because in all cases the optimal average distance from the convergence reward of the two agents should be equal to 10 (make the optimal offer or accept the optimal offer that the other agent makes
p4
aVWe call 1200 (or 1500) the convergence reward , i.e.,, the reward after converging to the maximum total utility solution if we do not take into account the action penalty
p5
aVIt is clear that as the state space becomes larger 100,000 training episodes per epoch are not enough for convergence
p6
aVThus the reward for Agent 1 is 1190, the reward for Agent 2 is 1190, and the average reward of the two agents is also 1190
p7
aVFor 5 fruits the average reward should be 1500 minus 10, and so forth
p8
aVFor 7 fruits PHC-W appears to perform worse than Q-learning but this is because, as we can see in Figure 5 , in this case more than 400,000 episodes per epoch are required for convergence
p9
aVAgent 1 makes an offer to Agent 2, namely 0 apples and 4 oranges, and Agent 2 accepts
p10
aVAs the number of fruits increases, Q-learning starts performing worse than the multi-agent RL algorithms
p11
aVWe vary the scenario complexity (i.e.,, the quantity of resources to be shared and consequently the state space size), the number of training episodes, the learning rate, and the exploration rate
p12
aVAlso, for 1, 2, and 3 fruits all algorithms converge and perform comparably
p13
aVClearly having a constant exploration rate in all epochs is problematic
p14
aVAs we will see in section 5 , even though the number of states for each agent is not large, it takes many iterations and high exploration rates for convergence due to the fact that both agents are learning at the same time and the assumption of interacting with a stationary environment no longer holds
