<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We are interested in domain adaptation for citation classification and therefore need a target dataset of citations and a non-citation source dataset</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Due to the infrequent use of negative citations, a substantial annotation effort (annotating over 5 times more data) would be necessary to reach 1000 negative citation instances, which is the number of negative instances in a single domain in the multi-domain corpus described below</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We treat citation polarity classification as a sentiment analysis domain adaptation task and therefore must be careful not to define features that are too domain specific</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Of course the risk in approaching the problem as domain adaptation is that the domains are so different that the representation of a positive instance of a movie or product review, for example, will not coincide with that of a positive scientific citation</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Using a larger training set, along with mSDA, which makes use of the unlabeled data, leads to the best results for citation classification</a>
