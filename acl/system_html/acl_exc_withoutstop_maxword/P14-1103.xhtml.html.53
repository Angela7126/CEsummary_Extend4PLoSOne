<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We test the model by learning the markedness constraints driving Wolof vowel harmony []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Wolof constraints provide an interesting testing ground for the model, because it is a small set of constraints to be learned, but contains the Harmony constraint, which can be violated by non-adjacent segments</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As such, it is unclear where a universal set of markedness constraints would come from</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As a result, learned constraints are consistent within paradigms, but across</a>
