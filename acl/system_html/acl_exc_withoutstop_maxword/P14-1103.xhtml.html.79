<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If constraints u'\u2019' weights are close together, multiple violations of lower-weighted constraints can reduce a candidate u'\u2019' s probability below that of a competitor with a single high-weight violation</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The IBPOT model defines a generative process for mappings between input and output forms based on three latent variables the constraint violation matrices F (faithfulness) and M (markedness), and the weight vector w</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus the log-probability of output \textipa EtE is 1/8 that of \textipa ete, and the log-probability of disharmonious \textipa Ete and \textipa etE are each 1/24 that of \textipa ete</a>
