<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The goal of the IBPOT model is to learn the markedness matrix M and weights w for both the markedness and faithfulness constraints</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In MaxEnt OT, each constraint has a weight, and the candidates u'\u2019' scores are the sums of the weights of violated constraints</a>
