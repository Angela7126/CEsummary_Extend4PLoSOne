VIn this section, we describe the character-based and word-based models we use as baselines, review existing approaches to combination, and describe our algorithm for joint decoding with dual decomposition
p1
aVDual decomposition (DD) [ 14 ] offers an attractive framework for combining these two types of models without incurring high costs in model complexity (in contrast to [ 18 ] ) or decoding efficiency (in contrast to bagging in [ 22 , 17 ]

aVIn this work, we propose a simple and principled joint decoding method for combining character-based and word-based segmenters based on dual decomposition
p3
aVIn the most commonly used contemporary approach to character-based segmentation, first proposed by [ 23 ] , CWS is seen as a character sequence tagging task, where each character is tagged on whether it is at the beginning, middle,
