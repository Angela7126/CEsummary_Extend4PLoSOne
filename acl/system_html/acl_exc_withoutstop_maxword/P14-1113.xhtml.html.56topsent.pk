VFurthermore, we propose a piecewise linear projection method based on relation clustering to better model hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations (Section 3.3.2
p1
aVAs a preliminary experiment, we compute the embedding offsets between some randomly sampled hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym word pairs and measure their similarities
p2
aVA uniform linear projection may still be under-representative for fitting all of the hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym word pairs, because the relations are rather diverse, as shown in Figure 2
p3
aVThe same training data for projections learning from CilinE (Section 3.3.3 ) is used as seed hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym pairs
p4
aVIn this section, we compare the proposed method with previous methods, including manually-built hierarchy extension, pairwise relation extraction based on patterns, word distributions, and web mining (Section 2
p5
aVWe observe that the same property also applies to some hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p6
aVSince hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations and its reverse (hyponym u'\u005cu2013' hypernym) have one-to-one correspondence, their performances are equal
p7
aVWe then develop a logistic regression classifier based on the patterns to recognize hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations
p8
aVHowever, the projection method cannot guarantee that theoretically, because the projections are learned from pairwise hypernym u'\u005cu2013' hyponym relations without
