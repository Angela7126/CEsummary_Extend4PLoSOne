<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The u'\u201c' STRUCT_initial u'\u201d' curve shows the time taken by STRUCT to come up with the first complete sentence, which partially solves the goal and which (at least) could be output if generation was interrupted and no better alternative was found</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the second step, the target subtree is removed from the sentence tree, and placed in the auxiliary tree as a direct replacement for the foot node</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Finally, the modified auxiliary tree is placed back in the sentence tree in the original target location</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The first step finds an adjoining location by searching through our sentence to find any subtree with a root whose label matches the root node of the auxiliary tree</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that, as STRUCT is an anytime algorithm, valid sentences are available very early in the generation process, despite the size of the set of adjoining trees</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This setting allows us to address the limitations outlined above it is naturally probabilistic, and handles probabilistic grammars; we are able to specify complex communicative goals and general criteria through a suitably-defined reward function; and, as we show in our experiments, recent developments in fast planning in large MDPs result in a generation system that can rapidly deal with very specific communicative goals</a>
