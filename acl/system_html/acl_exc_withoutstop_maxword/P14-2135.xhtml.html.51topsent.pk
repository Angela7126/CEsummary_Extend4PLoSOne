VThe Turney et al algorithm quantifies the concreteness of concepts that lack such a rating based on their proximity to rated concepts in a semantic vector space
p1
aVBy applying a logistic regression with noun concreteness as the predictor variable, Turney et al achieved a classification accuracy of 79% on this task
p2
aVTo evaluate the effectiveness of image dispersion as a proxy for concreteness we evaluated our algorithm on a binary classification task based on the set of 100 concrete and 100 abstract concepts A u'\u005cu222a' C introduced in Section 2
p3
aVFinally, we explored whether image dispersion can be applied to specific NLP tasks as an effective proxy for concreteness
p4
aVThe filtering approach described thus far improves multi-modal representations because image dispersion provides a means to distinguish concrete concepts from more abstract concepts
p5
aVThe USF evaluation set is particularly appropriate in the present context because concepts in the dataset are also rated for conceptual concreteness by at least 10 human annotators
p6
aVMulti-modal models in which perceptual input is filtered according to our algorithm learn higher-quality semantic representations than previous approaches, resulting in a significant performance improvement of up to 17% in capturing the semantic similarity of concepts
