<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For our evaluation, we developed an aligner to align the word clusters obtained with WordNet senses</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We, therefore, utilize the basic hypothesis of unsupervised sense induction to induce the sense clusters over various time periods and then compare these clusters to detect sense change</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The algorithm detected a lot of candidate words for the cases of birth, split/join as well as death</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Clearly, the cluster words correspond to a newer sense for these words and the mapped WordNet synset matches the birth cluster to a very high degree</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In addition to manual evaluation, we also performed automated evaluation for the candidate words</a>
