VFrame Lexicon In our experimental setup, we scanned the XML files in the u'\u005cu201c' frames u'\u005cu201d' directory of the FrameNet 1.5 release, which lists all the frames, the corresponding roles and the associated lexical units, and created a frame lexicon to be used in our frame and argument identification models

aVMost work on frame-semantic parsing has usually divided the task into two major subtasks frame identification , namely the disambiguation of a given predicate to a frame, and argument identification (or semantic role labeling), the analysis of words and phrases in the sentential context that satisfy the frame u'\u005cu2019' s semantic roles [ 8 , 7 ]
