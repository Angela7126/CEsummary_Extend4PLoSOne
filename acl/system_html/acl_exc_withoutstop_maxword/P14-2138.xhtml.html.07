<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this section, we describe two experiments aimed at quantifying the importance of the discriminative words and the indicative character bigrams that are identified by Algorithm 2</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Algorithm 2 summarizes our method of identifying the discriminative words and indicative character bigrams</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The results are shown in the Discriminative Words column of Table 2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We design an algorithm to identify the most discriminative words and the character bigrams that are indicative of such words, and perform two experiments to quantify their impact on the NLI task</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The results of this experiment are reported in the Indicative Bigrams column of Table 2</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The words that are identified as the most discriminative include function words, punctuation, very common content words, and the toponymic terms</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We report results on the test sets, after training on both the training and development sets</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The results are shown in the Random Words column of Table 2</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For comparison, the Random Bigrams column of Table 2 shows the mean accuracy over 100 trials obtained when 20 bigrams randomly selected from the set of 200 bigrams are replaced with random bigrams from outside of the set</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In the second experiment, we found that the majority of the most indicative character bigrams are shared among different language sets</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We are interested in identifying the character bigrams that are indicative of the most discriminative words in order to quantify their impact on the bigram-based classifier</a>
