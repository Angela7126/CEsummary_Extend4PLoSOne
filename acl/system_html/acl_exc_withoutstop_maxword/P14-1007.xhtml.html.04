<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>\citeA Bas:Bos:Eva:12 describe some amount of tailoring of the Boxer lexicon to include more of the Shared Task scope cues among those that produce the negation operator in the DRSs, but otherwise the system appears to directly take the notion of scope of negation from the DRS and project it out to the string, with one caveat</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>From these underspecified representations of possible scopal configurations, a scope resolution component can spell out the full range of fully-connected logical forms [ 4 ] , but it turns out that such enumeration is not relevant here the notion of scope encoded in the Shared Task annotations is not concerned with the relative scope of quantifiers and negation, such as the two possible readings of ( 3 ) represented informally below</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Table 1 presents the results of our various configurations in terms of both (a) whole scopes (i.e., a true positive is only generated when the predicted scope matches the gold scope exactly) and (b) in-scope tokens (i.e., a true positive for every token the system correctly predicts to be in scope</a>
