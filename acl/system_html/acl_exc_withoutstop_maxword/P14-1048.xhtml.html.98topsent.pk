VAs a result of successfully avoiding the expensive non-greedy parsing algorithms, our discourse parser is very efficient in practice
p1
aVIt is fairly safe to assume that each m k is a constant, in the sense that m k is independent of the total number of sentences in the document
p2
aVAs shown by Feng and Hirst ( 2012 ) , for a pair of discourse constituents of interest, the sequential information from contextual constituents is crucial for determining structures
p3
aVWe have thus showed that the time complexity is linear in n , which is the number of sentences in the document
p4
aVIn this way, we are able to take into account the sequential information from contextual discourse constituents, which cannot be naturally represented in HILDA with SVMs as local classifiers
p5
aVFirst, with a greedy bottom-up strategy, we develop a discourse parser with a time complexity linear in the total number of sentences in the document
p6
aVSecond, by using two linear-chain CRFs to label a sequence of discourse constituents, we can incorporate contextual information in a more natural way, compared to using traditional discriminative classifiers, such as SVMs
p7
aVTherefore, our model incorporates the strengths of both HILDA and Joty et al u'\u005cu2019' s model, i.e.,, the efficiency of a greedy parsing algorithm, and the ability to incorporate sequential information with CRFs
p8
aVIn addition to efficiency, our use of a single CRF chain for all constituents can better capture the
