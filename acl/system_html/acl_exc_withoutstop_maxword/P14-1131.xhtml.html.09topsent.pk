VWe evaluate CoSimRank for the tasks of synonym extraction and bilingual lexicon extraction
p1
aVCoSimRank can be used to compute many variations of basic node similarity u'\u005cu2013' including similarity for graphs with weighted and typed edges and similarity for sets of nodes
p2
aVAnother important similarity measure is cosine similarity of Personalized PageRank (PPR) vectors
p3
aVWe propose CoSimRank as an efficient algorithm for computing the similarity of nodes in a graph
p4
aVThe disadvantage of this similarity measure is significant and even more visible on bilingual lexicon extraction than on synonym extraction (see Table 2
