<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Accordingly, we evaluate the BRAE model on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to check whether a translation candidate and the source phrase are in the same meaning</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Assuming the phrase is a meaningful composition of its internal words, we propose Bilingually-constrained Recursive Auto-encoders (BRAE) to learn semantic phrase embeddings</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Instead, we focus on learning phrase embeddings from the view of semantic meaning, so that our phrase embedding can fully represent the phrase and best fit the phrase-based SMT</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With the learned model, we can accurately measure the semantic similarity between a source phrase and a translation candidate</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In our method, the standard recursive auto-encoder (RAE) pre-trains the phrase embedding with an unsupervised algorithm by minimizing the reconstruction error [ 22 ] , while the bilingually-constrained model learns to fine-tune the phrase embedding by minimizing the semantic distance between translation equivalents and maximizing the semantic distance between non-translation pairs</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, these phrase embeddings are not suitable to fully represent the phrasal translation units in SMT due to the lack of semantic meanings of the phrase</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In decoding with phrasal semantic similarities, we apply the semantic similarities of the phrase pairs as new features during decoding to guide translation candidate selection</a>
