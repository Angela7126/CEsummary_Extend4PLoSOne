VThis is the single source shortest path (SSSP) problem on DAG which has an efficient algorithm by preprocessing the DAG with topology sort, then traversing vertices and edges in topological order
p1
aVAlthough the model is formulated on first order HMM, i.e.,, the LM used for transition probability is a bigram one, it is easy to extend the model to take advantage of higher order n -gram LM, by tracking longer history while traversing the graph

aVSince Google Input Tool has to be accessed through a web interface and the network connection cannot be guaranteed we only take a subset
