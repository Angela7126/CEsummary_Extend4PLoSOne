VThere are three options select the concept with the maximum IDF, average IDF, or minimum IDF
p1
aVIn the Unified method, we chose the concept with the maximum IDF as the representative concept among all the variants
p2
aVThus, we use the concept with the maximum IDF value as the representative concept of all the variants
p3
aVWe now conduct experiments on Med11 to compare its performance with those of using average IDF and minimum IDF ones as the representative concept
p4
aVIn this paper, we use the maximum term IDF value from the aspect to estimate the importance, which performs better than using minimum and average IDF values as shown in the experiments (i.e.,, Table 6
p5
aVIn this paper, to address the limitation caused by the inaccurate concept mapping results, we propose to regularize the weighting strategies in the concept-based representation methods
p6
aVTo fix the negative impact on the concept IDF values, we propose to regularize the weighting based on the importance of the query aspect
p7
aVIn the Balanced method, we used the maximum IDF value to estimate the query importance
p8
aVIn particular, for each option, we generate a plot indicating the correlation between the IDF value of a concept and the relevance probability of the concept (i.e.,, the probability that a document containing the concept is relevant
p9
aVExperimental results over two TREC collections show that both proposed concept-based weighting regularization methods can improve the retrieval performance, and their
