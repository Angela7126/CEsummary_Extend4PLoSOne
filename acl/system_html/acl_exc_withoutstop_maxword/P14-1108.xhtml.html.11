<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Among other techniques, skip n -grams have also been considered as an approach to overcome problems of data sparsity []</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, with their restriction on a subsequence of words, skip n -grams are also used as a technique to overcome data sparsity []</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We learnt the generalized language models on the same split of the training corpus as the standard language model using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing and we also used the same set of test sequences for a direct comparison</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The data sets cover different domains and languages</a>
