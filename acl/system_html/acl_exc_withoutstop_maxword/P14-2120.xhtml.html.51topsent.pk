VThe task is to recognize whether the predicate-argument relationship, as expressed in the Hypothesis, holds implicitly also in the Text
p1
aVMore concretely, in textual inference the candidate predicate and argument are typically identified, as they are aligned by the RTE system to a predicate and an argument of the Hypothesis
p2
aVThis section describes a semi-automatic method for extracting candidate instances of implied predicate-argument relationship from an RTE dataset
p3
aVComparing to the implied SRL task, our task may better fit the needs of textual inference
p4
aVThus, the only remaining challenge is to verify that the sought relationship is implied in the text
p5
aVFor example, example 1 in Table 1 includes the explicit relationship u'\u005cu201c' derailment of train u'\u005cu201d' , which might indicate the implied relationship u'\u005cu201c' crash of train u'\u005cu201d'
p6
aVOn the other hand, the results obtained for our task, which does fit textual inference scenarios, are promising, and encourage utilizing algorithms for this task in actual inference systems
p7
aVThen, a human reader annotates each instance as u'\u005cu201c' Yes u'\u005cu201d' u'\u005cu2013' meaning that the implied relationship indeed holds in the Text, or u'\u005cu201c' No u'\u005cu201d' otherwise
p8
aVThe high results show that this task is feasible, and its solutions can be adopted as a component in textual inference systems
p9
aVWhile the results reported so far on that annotation task were relatively low, we suggest that the task itself may be more complicated than what is actually required in textual inference scenarios
