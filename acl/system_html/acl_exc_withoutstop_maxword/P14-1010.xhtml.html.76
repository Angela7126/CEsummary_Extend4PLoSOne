<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We approach this problem by augmenting an SMT system built over target segments with features that reflect the desegmented target words</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The second indicates that the source words contained a single discontiguity, as in a word-by-word translation of the u'\u201c' with his blue car u'\u201d' example from Section 2.2</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The chains found by this search are desegmented and then added to the output lattice as edges</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In summary, we are given a segmented lattice, which encodes the decoder u'\u2019' s translation space as an acceptor over morphemes</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This can be accomplished by composing the lattice with a desegmenting transducer that consumes morphemes and outputs desegmented words</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Instead of producing an abstract feature layer, morphological segmentation transforms the target sentence by segmenting relevant morphemes, which are then handled as regular tokens during alignment and translation</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Most techniques approach the problem by transforming the target language in some manner before training the translation model</a>
