<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When a person, animal, or machine reacts directly to a situation rather than comparing the consequences of alternative actions, free will is not involved.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The whole apparatus is visible to the ape, so it can see the consequences of each choice.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This is in accordance with the views of Locke and Hume.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Using free will is too slow in many situations, and training and practice often have the purpose of replacing comparison of consequences by automatic reaction to a situation.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>I think SDFW is simpler, catches the intuitive concepts of freedom and free will better, and are of more potential utility in AI.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Such a report, whether given externally or contemplated internally, constitutes the human sensation and the human report of free will.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Part of the problem of building humanlevel AI lies in inventing what kind of entity Result(a,s) shall be taken to be.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>[McC02] proposes adding a formula Occurs(e, s) to the language that can be used to assert that the event e occurs in situation s.</a>
