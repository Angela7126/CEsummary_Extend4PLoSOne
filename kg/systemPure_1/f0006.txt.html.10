<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>pHumans are able to observe and participate in social processes, to think, and to know the effect of establishing a relation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is a challenge to link thought to thought, and link thought to sketch, to design, and further to the process of production.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In super-link network, a node in any space can link to any node in any space, link can be of any type suitable for transmitting a certain type of information and influence can be in or through spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As the effect of mental space development, an artefact space is gradually separated from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from Cyber-Physical Systems, Cyber-Physical Society concerns the structure and function of the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space, and the study of its laws and principles.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Logistic processes will leave semantic images in cyberspace and can be adapted according to the change of demand.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>With interaction among the natural physical space, society and economy, the data network keeps changing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Real-time modelling in Cyber-Physical Society is based on the network of data, especially big data.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and socio space will fuse sciences and technologies specific to single space to form a new theory and method for studying and developing Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It contains more and more data, which indicates physical space, social space and itself to a certain extent [3].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>So, it is a close-loop of sensing, networking, operating and decision making.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cyber-Physical Society needs a reflexive, self-organized, and self-adaptive Cyber-Physical architecture that can preserve semantic images of itself and various individuals in lifetime and manage various activities and processes.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This concerns modelling and mapping between cyberspace, physical space, mental space, and socio space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thoughts propagate through links between individuals and self-organize to reflect the mental space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Therefore, IoT and CPS are not essentially new concepts from historical point of view, they can be regarded as the development of relevant techniques.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different from other spaces, cyberspace can perform a certain artificial intelligence and can establish link between spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Building appropriate model by collecting and analysing data is the core of modelling.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Different from Web of things, Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems [14], [15] and [16], CPSoc will be equipped with super-links to facilitate interaction through spaces [2] and [5].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>It enables socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as human physiological, psychological and mental status to be super-linked to create a panoramic interconnection environment for well-being and development.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Traditional modelling is based on model design, which may take a long time and the correctness is hard to be guaranteed.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Socio influence can be measured according to the extent of transforming the pattern in the super-link network.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>It enables humans to work efficiently, know more about the real, and understand each other.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>CPSoc holds humans, machines and physical space.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>However, models and theory sometimes cannot reflect the real due to the limitation of human understanding of the real world.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Users will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using the network to actively promote the flows of material, energy, techniques, information, knowledge, and services in this environment.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Humans can also actively select appropriate relations and persons according to requirement, situation and social rules.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Many applications employed sensors and actuators to get data and control machines before the terms of IoT and CPS were coined.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The gap between big data and the real information needs to be bridged by incorporating experience, rules given by human and reasoning over rules.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Even big data about things can be sensed, machines still cannot make sense of data because machines do not have this complex context.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>It ensures healthy and meaningful life of individuals, and maintains a reasonable rate of expansion of individuals in light of overall capacity and the material, knowledge, and service flow cycles.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>However, it is not feasible in large-scale dynamic CPSoc, because of the following reasons:</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Weiser envisioned that computers become so ubiquitous that people are unaware of their existence (e.g., ubiquitous computing) [22].</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Different from traditional modelling, the real-time paradigm needs no mathematic model.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>u'\u2022' Data reflects past status of the real-world or even may not correctly reflect the real-world.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Connecting these spaces can answer what, where, why, when, and how from different spaces [4], [5] and [18].</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Different from digital archival, CPSoc preserving is real-time, lifetime, and at multi-semantic layers.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>(1) pmachines know little relation in human society and the nature, data structures in machines are for machines to process not for humans to read, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover socio and natural laws and resolve relevant issues without human instructionq, and (2) pmachines are hard to know the effect of establishing and making use of relations, and to explain computing result according to society and the natureq.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Different from control processes and computer algorithms, Cyber-Physical Society works with pervasive interactions between individuals within and cross spaces.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Tennenhouse proposed Active Network and Proactive Computing and called for getting physical and getting real when developing next-generation networks [19] and [20].</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>(2) Can machines make sense of data if big data can be captured?</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Aeroplanes can sense and record some flying data such as location, height, temperature, and fuel, and they have communication ability and can even autopilot according to pre-designed route and program.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Some individuals like paintings are passive, but some like robots can behave according to programs pre-designed by humans.</a>
