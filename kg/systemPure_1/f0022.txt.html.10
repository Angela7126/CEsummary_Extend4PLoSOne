<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, it is worthwhile to chip pieces off the creativity problem and work on them separately.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One could argue that the colors are present implicitly when a checkerboard is mentioned, and perhaps the problem would be purer if it referred to an 8 \times 8 array.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, this argument is at a meta-level to the Minsky and Stefanuk proofs and therefore can't claim to be non-creative.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This is a kind of program, but it doesn't need a termination condition, because the termination is apparent to the problem solver.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>According to a 1999 personal communication, the idea can be expressed more concisely.</a>
