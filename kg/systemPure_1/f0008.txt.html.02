<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The main theory of RSM consists of the basic methodology of resource space, normal forms, operations on resource spaces and their completeness, relations between operations and normal forms, RSM algebra and calculus, expressiveness of query language, search complexity, storage mechanism, and decentralized RSM [35][36].</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>the satisfactory constraints for effective resource management, transforming 1NF into 2NF, integrating resource space with semantic link network to support advanced applications, and automatically uploading resources into resource space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The hierarchical resource space can be transformed into the equivalent u'\u2018' flat' resource space by projecting each leaf node of the coordinate tree onto the axis where the root resides [35][36], but this projection makes a resource space lose abstraction layers.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The probabilistic relational table satisfying 1NF is limited in ability to represent the probabilities of attribute values, and, using tuple probabilities to specify the probabilities of attributes' values could lead to information loss or combinatorial explosion of tuples.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>According to the current classification in the mental space, the user needs to outline the Classification Tree (denoted as CT) for each axis in the cyber resource space, where the higher layer consists of more general classifications, and the lower layer consists of more specific classifications.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To create a unified model for effectively organizing and managing various resources with uncertainty in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space is a fundamental challenge.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A probabilistic XML approach is proposed to resolve conflicts during data integration, where the order in documents and DTDs plays an important role [21].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The minimum satisfactory degree reflects users' confidence in determining the category of resources when inputting resources and the users' demand on the accuracy of retrieving resources.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The cyber space can alarm humans or make recommendations when abnormal phenomena, behaviors and events are detected in the physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A coordinate can be a coordinate tree (i.e., a classification tree), where every node represents a basic concept or a pattern representing a category of resources (e.g., the words sequentially cooccurred in a set of documents can be regarded as a kind of pattern, and communities in socio networks can be regarded as another kind of pattern).</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A framework is proposed to acquire, maintain and query XML documents with incomplete information, in which the order in documents and DTDs (Document Type Definition) is ignored [2].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Many classification mechanisms such as file system and ACM CCS (Computing Classification System) have been designed to effectively manage digital resources in the cyber space.</a>
