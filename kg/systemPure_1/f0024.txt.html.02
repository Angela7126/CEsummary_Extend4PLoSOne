<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Friedberg approach was successful in learning only how to move a single bit from one memory cell to another, and its scheme of rewarding instructions involved in successful runs by reducing their probability of modification was shown by Herbert Simon (a now substantiated rumor froma 1987 personal communication) to be inferior to testing each program thoroughly and completely scrapping any program that wasn't perfect.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In my opinion, GPS was unsuccessful as a general problem solver, because problems don't take this form in general and because most of the knowledge about the common sense needed for problem solving and achieving goals is not simply representable in the form of rules for transforming expressions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, a Prolog program incorporating this fragment directly can sterilize a container only by killing each bacterium individually and would require that some other part of the program successively generate the names of the bacteria.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Prolog represents a local optimum in this continuum, because Horn clauses are medium expressive but can be interpreted directly by a logical problem solver.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This resembles the usual logical natural deduction systems, but for reasons beyond the scope of this lecture, it is probably not correct to regard contexts as equivalent to sets of assumptions -- not even infinite sets of assumptions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While Friedberg's problem was learning from experience, all schemes for representing knowledge by program suffer from similar difficulties when the object is to combine disparate knowledge or to make programs that modify knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(McCarthy and Hayes 1969) made the distinction between epistemological and heuristic aspects of the AI problem and asserted that generality is more easily studied epistemologically.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Notice that all qualifications to the performance of the actions are explicit in the premisses and that statements (called frame axioms) about what doesn't change when an action is performed are explicitly included.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Some contexts are very specific, so that Watson is a doctor in the context of Sherlock Holmes stories and a baritone psychologist in a tragic opera about the history of psychology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It seemed then and still seems that humans communicate mainly in declarative sentences rather than in programming languages for good objective reasons that will apply whether the communicator is a human, a creature from Alpha Centauri or a computer program.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Newell's current candidate for general problem representation is SOAR (Laird, Newell and Rosenbloom 1987), which, as I understand it, is concerned with transforming one state to another, where the states need not be represented by expressions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The facts that were included in the axioms had to be delicately chosen in order to avoid the introduction of contradictions arising from the failure to delete a sentence that wouldn't be true in the situation that resulted from an action.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(Some people propose that the knowledge is internally expressed in the form of examples only, but strong mechanisms using analogy and similarity permit their more general use.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This treats the qualification problem, because any number of conditions that may be imagined as preventing moving or painting can be added later and asserted to imply the corresponding ab aspect ...</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Every increase in expressive power carries a price in the required complexity of the reasoning and problem solving programs.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For example, MYCIN (Buchanan and Shortliffe 1974) has many rules about how to infer which bacterium is causing an illness based on symptoms and the result of laboratory tests.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A logical system using contexts might provide operations of entering and leaving a context yielding what we might call ultra-natural deduction allowing a sequence of reasoning like</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>One kind of generality in AI comprises methods for finding solutions that are independent of the problem domain.</a>
