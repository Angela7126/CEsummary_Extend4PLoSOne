<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to document metadata, semantic links, such as sameAuthor, sameEditor, sameJournal, sameConf, sameYear, sameProject, sameAf u'\ufb01' liation and sameLanguage, can be found.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This stage includes u'\ufb01' nding keywords of documents, clustering documents hierarchically, building keyword co-occurrence network and discovering semantic links between documents, clusters and keywords.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The wvtool (word vector tool) is a simple but u'\ufb02' exible Java library to create word vector representations of text documents.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Figure 3 shows an SLN segment of document clusters, where dx represents document, c1x and c2x represent the clusters at levels 1 and 2, respectively, and ch represents the cluster networks that are iteratively clustered h times into one cluster.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some semantic links between documents are implied by metadata such as topic, author, creation or publication time, document length and language.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This step needs to determine the document source, input documents, carry out text analysis and build keyword u'\u2013' document networks and keyword co-occurrences network.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An approach to automatic categorization of documents was proposed for exploiting contextual information extracted according to the analysis of HTML structure of Web documents as well as the topology of the Web [7].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The attributes of resources and rules on attributes are the minimum semantic worldview needed for machines to automatically discover semantic links.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Automatic discovery of semantic links on document contents needs technologies such as text analysis, document clustering and classi u'\ufb01' cation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic link network (SLN) model extends the Web by attaching semantic indicators to hyperlinks [1].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Resource attributes and related classi u'\ufb01' cations form a hierarchical structured network.</a>
