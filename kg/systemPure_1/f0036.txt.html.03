<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(2) A random access costs a seek time, half a rotation time, and then the transfer time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, the marginal cost of an instruction per second is approximately the marginal cost of a byte.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(18) The cpu cost of a SAN network message is 3,000 clocks and 1 clock per byte.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Such a tape archive is half the cost per terabyte of disk storage, but tape does not provide easy access to the data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>At that time a GB of disk cost about a million dollars, and so it made sense to have someone optimizing it and monitoring the use of disk space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(12) Alpha (the MB/MIPS ratio) is rising from 1 to 4.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In practice, real benchmarks see CPI (clocks per instruction) of 1 to 3.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So, today, the rule of thumb is that a person can manage 1 TB to 100 TB of storage -- with 10 TB being typical.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the local access saves both, then the R_local is a fraction of a second.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(1) We can reduce disk accesses by caching popular (hot) pages in main memory, and writing a log of their changes to disk.</a>
