<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to Theorem 1, the decomposition is a loss-less one.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is easy to verify that all closures of the single semantic link types construct a classification for the semantic link types of the SLN schema, and we can decompose an SLN schema based on such a classification.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to Theorem 1, the decomposition from Algorithm 3 is loss-less.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Users can define SLN instances by instantiating the global schema, or define a sub-schema according to the global schema first and then instantiating the sub-schemas.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, we can study the updating issues according to the variation of the rule set.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Meanwhile, the size of rule set rs is a constant.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Reasoning on S' is executed according to the rule set rs'.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Therefore, we get the following six RC-NF1 sub-schemas according to Algorithm 1.</a>
