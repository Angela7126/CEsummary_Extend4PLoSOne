<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The statuses include health, current micro physical space, socio attributes, individuals who were or are trying to super-link their status, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals under privilege constraints.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Data is continually collected through sensors deployed in the physical space (e.g., temperature meters and cameras) and in socio space (e.g., ticket machines and mobile phones).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In CPSoc, different spaces obey different laws, physical laws do not hold in cyberspace and socio space, but individuals in different spaces can interact with each other or influence one another following some common laws.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from Cyber-Physical Systems, Cyber-Physical Society concerns the structure and function of the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space, and the study of its laws and principles.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and socio space will fuse sciences and technologies specific to single space to form a new theory and method for studying and developing Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A falling apple in the physical space will be able to link to different devices in cyberspace, which incur relevant semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>With the generation and development of human beings, individual mental spaces are gradually separated from physical human bodies.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Different types of resources could be fused on demand to provide services through logistics of materials in physical space, information in cyberspace, knowledge in mental space, human and financial resources in social space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>pCyber-Physical Society is a multi-dimensional complex space that generates and evolves diverse subspaces to contain different types of individuals interacting with, reflecting or influencing each other directly or through cyber, physical, socio and mental subspaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>An early notion of large-scale human?machine interconnection environment that unites physical space, virtual space and mental space was proposed in 2005 [1], which is actually a scientific definition of CPSoc.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Human beings will live and develop with Cyber-Physical Society (in short CPSoc), which consists of cyberspace, physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Society is a space that contains socio individuals (humans, artefacts created and used by humans and events), relations between individuals, worth, authorities, and rules of activities.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>pConnecting various networks and machines with nature, society, and human minds can create a new environment where individuals have semantic images to enhance mutual understanding.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As the effect of mental space development, an artefact space is gradually separated from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Modern city is a typical example of CPSoc, where people communicate through information flow network and knowledge flow network, use various equipments supported by energy flow network, influence through relational network, move through traffic network, and live with material (e.g., food and gas) flow network.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Super-links enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of apple in cyberspace can link to an apple in supermarket or on an apple tree through sensors, and can further link to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>CPSoc is a complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Cyber-Physical Society connects not only physical space, socio space, cyberspace and mental space but also past, present and future.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Humans weave and maintain super-links between spaces, evaluate and evolve socio values, and make final decisions to change personal statuses and to influence the evolution of the spaces in Cyber-Physical Society at certain probability.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>pijl:copj, where pi and pj are individuals or classes in one space or in different spaces, l represents the specification of the link between two points, and c represents the type of content or material that can be transmitted from pi to pj.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>It enables socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as human physiological, psychological and mental status to be super-linked to create a panoramic interconnection environment for well-being and development.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Humans can establish various models to reduce the gap and can minimize the gap in particular applications, for example, the semantic link network is to make sense of network [4], [2], [9], [5], [13] and [18].</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Principles and methods in cyberspace, physical space or social space may not be suitable for the new space.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>More importantly, humans have the ability to link symbols to the mental space and to the physical space.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Semantic communities at different levels support zooming on semantic link network to obtain semantic views of different abstraction levels.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>In super-link network, a node in any space can link to any node in any space, link can be of any type suitable for transmitting a certain type of information and influence can be in or through spaces.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Versatile individuals and socio roles coexist harmoniously yet evolve, provide appropriate on-demand information, knowledge and services for each other, transform from one form into another, interact with each other through various links, and self-organize according to socio value chains.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Measure in one space (e.g., physical space) is usually not suitable for another space (e.g., social space).</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Human life is more and more in the artefact space and gradually away from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Human bodies belong to the physical space, behaviours belong to social space, and thoughts belong to mental space.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The integration of the classification space and the semantic link network supports navigation with the features of triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating, and zooming through spaces.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>The extent can be measured by the number of individuals who change their communities or obviously change the behaviours of certain number of individuals due to influence.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>The Resource Space Model locates resources in multi-dimensional classification space and supports zooming on classification hierarchies [13] and [18].</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Research concerns the principles that individuals in different spaces interact with each other, transform from one form into another, and coordinate through appropriate information, thought, service, material and energy flows.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>CPSoc will extend the ability of humans to reflect the physical space, to conveniently interact with each other, to classify/cluster/locate individuals, to search/surf/zoom in cyberspace, and to locate/reason/navigate in mental space.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>For example, unhealthy individual or community in once space will influence the health of individuals or communities in another space.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Cyber-Physical Society will reflect individuals, communities, interactions and events at multiple semantic layers and link semantic elements in different layers.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Study concerns competition, symbiosis and cooperation laws among individuals and among communities in the evolution process of the Cyber-Physical Society, as well as laws of networking, evolving and influencing the super-linked CPSocio networks [21] and [9].</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Interaction is a process of physical action and reaction, socio behaviours, thought exchange or information transmission that changes the statuses of involved individuals.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Tennenhouse proposed Active Network and Proactive Computing and called for getting physical and getting real when developing next-generation networks [19] and [20].</a>
