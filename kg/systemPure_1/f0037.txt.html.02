<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Things are going so well that the company decides to (1) do a leveraged buyout of a much larger company and asks you to integrate your site with theirs, (2) form a consortium with two other companies to provide some new services, (3) internationalize the operation offering services in the 20 major languages and 50 major currencies and 500 tax codes, and (4) embrace the latest technology fad, which today is UDDI, WSDL, schemas, XLANG, SOAP, and XML.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is a class of single-node ScaleUp systems from HP, IBM, and Sun, running DB2, Oracle, and Sybase that process about 300 million tpcC transactions per day on a computer costing about ten million dollars with a 20 TB database.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Taking Microsoft as an example, the most spectacular MSN outages of late have been due to operations mistakes (misconfigured a router) and sabotage (denial of service attacks).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Request fulfillment often requires accessing other web services or databases (a travel site might need to access airline, auto, and hotel servers, a bookseller might need to access the various publisher warehouses).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The tpcC results show this fairly clearly, when you subtract out the disks from the equation (disk prices are nearly constant across all vendors) the residue systems vary in cost by a factor of ten or more.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The best I can do is make it easy for the folks at SAP, Great Plains, AOL, Yahoo!, eBay, Fidelity, USGS, Amazon, MSN, ...</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Now most modern database systems offer database replication -- and the feature is widely used to geoplex data and to provide fallback service.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In part this is due to Moore's law, in part it is due to our finally bringing the software base to a modular and partitionable architecture that maps well to shared-nothing arrays (and hence to shared memory and shared disk arrays).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>I confess to having drunk the .NET cool-aid and so agree that UDDI, WSDL, schemas, XLANG, SOAP, and XML help make applications more agile.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Some impressive systems run by tiny staffs, but the norm is that operations and management consumes huge budgets.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>hardware, software, operations mistakes, and environmental problems (power failures, storms,..</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Today, we are at 600,000 tpmC (about a billion tpcC transactions per day), and the cost per transaction is hovering in the range of 5 microdollars -- the hardware and software cost of the system equates to about five dollars per million transactions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Some connections are sticky (SSL connections, web page connection objects) but stateless middle-tier servers to give a more scaleable and fault-tolerant design.</a>
