<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As new runs are acquired, new records are added to the catalog and new records are added to the Match table (which is easily computed incrementally.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given such a run2, we need to know if the missing object O1 is either near the run2 footprint edge or is inside a run2 mask.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If this is an inexpensive test and if there are less than a thousand runs, then one can compute the overlapping run pairs by simply comparing all runs to all others.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>O1 is at the detection threshold and the seeing was good in run1 but not as good in run2 or O1 may be invisible if run2 is a different kind of instrument (e.g.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As explained in [2, 4], spherical regions are represented as the union of convex hulls that are each the intersection of a set of half-spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Of the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge because the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If there are no matches in a catalog then that field is filled in with the relational null value.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
