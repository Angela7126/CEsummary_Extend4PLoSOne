<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The hierarchical resource space can be transformed into the equivalent u'\u2018' flat' resource space by projecting each leaf node of the coordinate tree onto the axis where the root resides [35][36], but this projection makes a resource space lose abstraction layers.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Xi -> [0, 1], i in [1, n]> consists of a resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) and a membership probability function u'\u0392' _{ri}, for any resource r and axis Xi in the resource space, u'\u0392' _{ri}(C) denotes the membership probability that r belongs to coordinate C under the condition that r belongs to the parent coordinate of C.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A 2NF probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) is a 1NF resource space and for any pair of coordinates C and C' at Xi (1 u'\u2264' i u'\u2264' n), a resource r satisfies Prob(r in R(C) u'\u2227' r in R(C')) = 0, where R(C) represents the resources that C represents.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The process of inserting a resource into a probabilistic resource space is the same as the original resource space except that the membership probability functions in the P- RSM can take value within [0, 1].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>the satisfactory constraints for effective resource management, transforming 1NF into 2NF, integrating resource space with semantic link network to support advanced applications, and automatically uploading resources into resource space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The second normal form resource space (2NF) is a 1NF resource space where coordinates at any axis are independent of each other, i.e., a coordinate is neither a part of another nor can represent another coordinate at the same axis.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>To implement a smart resource space that can adapt itself, the resource space needs to trace the active points in the user's mental space and previous queries so that adaption is in line with the evolution of user's mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Although a resource space and a relational database can be transformed from one into the other [37], a good resource space (especially for a multi-dimensional resource space) may not be transformed into a good relational table, vice versa.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A resource space that does not satisfy 2NF is useful in applications since sometimes dependent coordinates cannot be avoided in applications due to the understanding gap between the resource space creater, the users who input resources, the users who retrieve resources, and the authors of the resources.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The resource space can automatically detect and upload resources by matching the pattern in resources and the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For a probabilistic resource space RS that satisfies 1NF, 2NF or 3NF, the membership probability interval that resource r belongs to point p can be obtained in polynomial time of the number of points in RS.</a>
