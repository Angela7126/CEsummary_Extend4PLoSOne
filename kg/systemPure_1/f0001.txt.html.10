<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A text can be understood from different aspects because of the nature of language use and understanding.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This axiom is the basis of representation (including using languages) and summarization (especially, for multi-document summarization).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Humans have the ability to summarize non-symbol representations, which can be regarded as a different dimension from text.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So, the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A summary can be in form of a hypertext, where some texts are summarized as a hyperlink, and some texts containing hyperlinks are summarized as a hyperlink at the higher level.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The summarization system is responsible for classifying, linking and reorganizing representations.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.</a>
