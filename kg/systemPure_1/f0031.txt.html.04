<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Here we describe a plan to develop an Internet data resource in astronomy to help address this problem in which, because of the nature of the data and analyses required of them, the data remain widely distributed rather than gathered in one or a few databases (e.g., GenBank).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given that data are doubling every year and that the data become public within a year, about half the world's astronomy data is available to all.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are good languages for defining data schemas (structures) and for mapping these data schemas into existing data management systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>a unified search engine, to collect and aggregate data from several large archives simultaneously, and a huge distributed computing resource, to perform the analyses close to the data, in order to avoid moving petabytes of data across the networks.</a>
