<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, the reduction process should be continued until a completely reduced map is obtained in which all countries have at least four neighbors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The idea is even more powerful, because eliminating countries with three or fewer neighbors may remove enough neighbors from some other countries so that they have three or fewer neighbors and can themselves be removed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This leaves all the remaining countries with three or fewer neighbors, so the second cycle of reduction leaves the null map, reduced map.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>No matter how the rest of the map is colored, there is always a color available for such a country.1 We use this in to improve a Pereira-Porto map coloring program by "reducing the map" by removing such countries and doing our trial-and-error coloring on the reduced map, confident that once the reduced map is colored, the coloring can be extended to the omitted countries.</a>
