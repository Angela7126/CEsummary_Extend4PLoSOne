<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The solution to both these problems, cost and reliability, is to reduce or eliminate operations tasks.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The next step is to have redundant servers and a load balancing system that can redistribute the load as servers fail.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But, they have to have exactly the same data (or nearly so).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Indeed, gradually they are running more and more of the database functionally within the box.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Paradoxically, scalability is the least of our problems today.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The premise is that XML Web Services will be the basis for both adding new services to an application, and the basis for integrating applications.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is a controversial statement, but I will try to convince you that we have "solved" the scalability problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This was more transactions than all the banks, all the airlines, and all the hotels in the world.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>What this really means is that you cannot just have a ScaleUp story -- virtually everyone needs a ScaleOut story for packs of partitions (failover) and for GeoPlexs, and just to carry the load of an expanding application base.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Needless to say, Microsoft and others appreciate this and are working furiously to improve the situation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Clearly, these problems have magnified in the recent past and it seems likely that they will increase.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But, this need not be the case.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>But, due to some operations and sabotage problems, the end-user has seen more like Class-2 service.</a>
