<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Pereira and Porto (1980) give a logic program for coloring planar maps with four colors and discuss how "selective backtracking" can reduce the search involved in coloring a map from that done by a straightforward PROLOG execution of the same program.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our improved coloring algorithm then reduces the map by repeatedly dropping countries with four or fewer neighbors, colors the reduced map exhaustively, and then colors the dropped countries in the reverse order using Kempe transformations when necessary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The discussion by Pereira and Porto treats coloring maps purely as an example of logic programming, and the improvements they discuss apply to all logic program systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They point out that when an attempt to satisfy a literal fails, because the two adjacent regions mentioned have been assigned the same color, standard PROLOG will take back the most recent assignment of a color even if the region most recently colored was neither of those involved in the incompatibility.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and the countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and South America all reduce to null maps when countries with three or fewer neighbors are successively eliminated.</a>
