<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Almost all domains such as social management (e.g., smart cities), business (e.g., manufacturing and marketing), education, health, security, environment (e.g., monitoring, protection, and industrial symbiosis, etc.), energy, and sciences (especially in physics, astronomy, biology, ecology, and earth science) have raised the challenge of accessing, managing and analyzing rapidly expanding big data, especially the dispersed and heterogeneous nature of these data (Howe, 2008) (Reichman, et al.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In Web age, scientists have used search engines and online digital resources (including scientific data and papers) and online social networks frequently when doing research, especially at the stages of writing proposal (e.g., checking related idea, searching collaborators and references), collecting data, analyzing data, and writing papers (citation, submission, review, etc.).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Initiatives include the German's high-tech strategy industry 4.0 program that focuses on adaptability, resource efficiency and human factors in business and value processes (Roland Berger, 2014), the USA's Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition that promotes collaborative R&D with shared infrastructure that facilitates the broad adoption of intelligent manufacturing (https://smartmanufacturingcoalition.org), the Industrial Internet projects that bring together two revolutions:</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>u'\u2022' Sustainable development, which concerns strategies for improving behaviours to gain higher values or lowering the cost and more positive environmental benefits, e.g., raising bargaining power and enhancing competition power and carrying on green transformation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If the enterprise is at the introduction stage, data about relevant products (including components), potential competitors, customers, suppliers, market, and constraints like environmental protection should be selected to support product innovation, design and development.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The implicit architecture facilitates the sharing of knowledge between members through organizational mechanisms including various forums (including physical and online conferences, workshops, and publications), work groups, and protocols with agreed strategies.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>IBM big data initiative is to integrate current techniques such as database, cloud, stream processing and content computing to upgrade enterprise information systems toward higher performance and better services for enterprise management and decision.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, data management research and warehouse research aim at obtaining industry-leading database performance while lowering administration, storage, development and server costs, and realizing extreme speed with capabilities optimized for analytics workloads.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>multi-disciplinary innovations arising from the industrial revolution, innovations from computing, information and communication systems brought by Internet revolution (http://www.industrialinternetconsortium.org), and Intelligent Manufacturing Systems that focus on frontier technologies in predictive analytics including prognostics and health management technologies, cyber-physical systems, industrial big data analytics, and intelligent decision (http://www.imscenter.net).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It is questionable that computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address the deepest questions about the nature and the origins of human thought, e.g., how does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning?</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Citing (including commenting) is a kind of interaction that could attract potential citations because (1) new citations could incur explicit citation links between papers, implicit comment links between papers and researchers, explicit cooperation links, and implicit knowledge flows between researchers, which form small worlds of research;</a>

<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Natural language processing, machine learning, image and speech recognition and data visualization are key techniques used to enable people and machines to interact more naturally to extend human expertise and cognition (http://www.research.ibm.com/cognitive-computing).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Economists can analyze economic structure, profit, tax, salary, employment, raw materials, and disclose the relationship between different industrial sections and forecast the influences of investment.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A software called Globus was developed to build an adaptive wide area resource environment, and integrated higher-level services that enable applications to adapt to heterogeneous and dynamically changing meta-computing environments.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The World Wide Web, the biggest artificial network in human history, contains free texts, webpages, databases, and online social networks, which change from time to time.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>With intensive discussion in scientific journals and various social medias, public has been impressed that big data with statistical tools offer a powerful approach to solving hard problems.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The main purpose of analyzing human behavior is to find, understand and estimate various requirements so as to effectively operate the observed system (e.g., organize resources for production) to provide on-demand products or services.</a>
