<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>From the definition of the probabilistic resource space, we can specify the membership probability that a resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Xi -> [0, 1], i in [1, n]> consists of a resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) and a membership probability function u'\u0392' _{ri}, for any resource r and axis Xi in the resource space, u'\u0392' _{ri}(C) denotes the membership probability that r belongs to coordinate C under the condition that r belongs to the parent coordinate of C.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A probabilistic event in the Probabilistic Resource Space Model P-RSM is the probability that a resource belongs to a certain class.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn), if RS satisfies 1NF, then the membership probability interval that resource r belongs to point p is [max{0, ...</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For a probabilistic resource space RS that satisfies 1NF, 2NF or 3NF, the membership probability interval that resource r belongs to point p can be obtained in polynomial time of the number of points in RS.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A resource space with the same structure can be created in the cyber space according to the mental resource space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) Resources are distributed more evenly in the probabilistic resource space than in the resource space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Theorem 1 indicates that for any two axes Xi and Xj of a 3NF probabilistic resource space, the probability that resource r belongs to Xi is equal to the probability that r belongs to Xj.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Classification is the most basic method for organizing various resources in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The process of inserting a resource into a probabilistic resource space is the same as the original resource space except that the membership probability functions in the P- RSM can take value within [0, 1].</a>
