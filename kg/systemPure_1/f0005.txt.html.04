<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Tracing the origin of big data research and linking big data to behavior, knowledge and cyber-infrastructure is a way to explore big data methodology.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Figure 5 depicts the mapping from the data generated by the observed system in the physical space into the virtual knowledge space through the representation space and a group of cognitive systems that evolve with the interaction with the physical space and the external representation space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Human minds continuously capture and process information and discover knowledge while cyber-infrastructure stores, manages and processes the data of the observed system and the data of the people who use the cyber-infrastructure.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>How to find related work and summarize them is an important research in big data era, but this kind of big data problem can be solved by traditional computing paradigm.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A big idea in computing history is to transform the thinking computing model u'\u23af' u'\uf8e7' Turing machine into an implementation model by viewing program as data and enabling programs to be fetched and stored in the same way as data (Neumann, 1958).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The big data of the observed system and the big data of previous research actually indicate scientific problems that need to be explored.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The information modeling system transforms data (e.g., texts) into information with computable information models (e.g., proposition network, cognitive map, probability models and generative models) and measures (e.g., measuring information quantity in text) through reading, or transforms information into text(s) according to information models (e.g., generative model).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A key task of data analysis is to select small number of dimensions, to ensure their independency and each of which can specify all data of the space so that all data can be access from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Establishing a multi-dimensional space to hold big data generated by the observed complex system is a basic approach to data management and analysis.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Discovering problems from the big data of various spaces will be a new computing paradigm in this big data era.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The growing scale and variety of networks such as online social networks, the Internet of Things, and mobile communication networks raise the challenge of managing not only big data but also the big networks that generate big data.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>However, big data analysis can only be effective when data analyzers have the knowledge of business strategies, and can link the potential insights to business opportunities.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The paradigm programs = data structures + algorithms has been shifted to distributed programs = distributed data structures + distributed algorithms, where data and algorithms can be deployed on massively coordinated machines.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>If a system cannot answer a question but it can do within the given time after inputting the data (including tables, texts, images, videos), then we say that the system has obtained certain knowledge from the data and it has the ability of processing the data.</a>
