<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Tracing the origin of big data research and linking big data to behavior, knowledge and cyber-infrastructure is a way to explore big data methodology.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Data represent things.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Establishing a multi-dimensional space to hold big data generated by the observed complex system is a basic approach to data management and analysis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Big data may mislead analysis if data are not hold by the dimensions of the observed complex system.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The big data of the observed system and the big data of previous research actually indicate scientific problems that need to be explored.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>dealing with big data by localizing data to the people who generate and use data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Big data are mapped into a data space by establishing and classifying links.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Some researchers proposed to develop big data research toward a science (data science), aiming at deriving valuable insights (or knowledge) from big data.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Managing knowledge for effective data analysis is the key to generating great knowledge from analyzing data.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(3) What kind of cyber-infrastructure is required to manage big data and to support data analysis, discovery of knowledge, decision and scientific research?</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Big data analysis involves in a dual complex system consisting of an observed system (e.g., a factory) and a human system.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Discovering problems from the big data of various spaces will be a new computing paradigm in this big data era.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Data analysts can discover knowledge only when they have knowledge about the observed system that generates data.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Big data is significant only when it reflects the status of the complex system from many dimensions such as time, location, human, value, organization and behavior, which determine the way to organize and operate data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Answering the following questions helps explore big data from science, system, information and data perspectives.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
