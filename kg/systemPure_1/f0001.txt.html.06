<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Some summaries are mainly in form of text such as the abstracts of scientific papers, the prefaces of books, the tables of contents, CVs, the headlines of news, webpages with hyperlinks, book reviews, Wikipedia, and the results of Web search.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A solution to implement this idea is to make use of existing summaries made by humans and the corresponding pictures in the networks of pictures, tags, summaries, source texts and people who involved in forming and using these things.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is a natural idea to select and organize important sentences from the original text to form a summary.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Summarization is involved in representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Text summarization is a special case of summarization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Versatile summaries accompany our daily life.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Using pictures to summarize text is a new direction of summarizing text.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The core representations in one representation (e.g., text) render its topic.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
