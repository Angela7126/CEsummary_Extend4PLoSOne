<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the effect of mental space development, an artefact space is gradually separated from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This concerns modelling and mapping between cyberspace, physical space, mental space, and socio space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) The separation of mental space from the physical space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(4) The separation of cyberspace from symbol space and artefact space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Principles and methods in cyberspace, physical space or social space may not be suitable for the new space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Cyber-Physical Society connects not only physical space, socio space, cyberspace and mental space but also past, present and future.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Cyberspace extends symbol space and artefact space to reflect more of other spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Cyberspace plays the role of extending human sensation to cyberspace, physical space, and social space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Measure in one space (e.g., physical space) is usually not suitable for another space (e.g., social space).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Human beings will live and develop with Cyber-Physical Society (in short CPSoc), which consists of cyberspace, physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>CPSoc holds humans, machines and physical space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Different from Cyber-Physical Systems, Cyber-Physical Society concerns the structure and function of the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space, and the study of its laws and principles.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>More importantly, humans have the ability to link symbols to the mental space and to the physical space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Human bodies belong to the physical space, behaviours belong to social space, and thoughts belong to mental space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(2) The separation of society from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Human life is more and more in the artefact space and gradually away from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Different types of resources could be fused on demand to provide services through logistics of materials in physical space, information in cyberspace, knowledge in mental space, human and financial resources in social space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and socio space will fuse sciences and technologies specific to single space to form a new theory and method for studying and developing Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>A falling apple in the physical space will be able to link to different devices in cyberspace, which incur relevant semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>An early notion of large-scale human?machine interconnection environment that unites physical space, virtual space and mental space was proposed in 2005 [1], which is actually a scientific definition of CPSoc.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>CPSoc will extend the ability of humans to reflect the physical space, to conveniently interact with each other, to classify/cluster/locate individuals, to search/surf/zoom in cyberspace, and to locate/reason/navigate in mental space.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Humans often use orthogonal space to locate an object in the physical space.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>With interaction among the natural physical space, society and economy, the data network keeps changing.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Thoughts propagate through links between individuals and self-organize to reflect the mental space.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Mathematicians have created many abstract spaces such as Euclidean space and Hilbert space.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>With the generation and development of human beings, individual mental spaces are gradually separated from physical human bodies.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Individual mental space consists of thoughts (including commonsense, concepts, rules, methods, principles, and theories) and imagination (derivation of links through thoughts).</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Society is a space that contains socio individuals (humans, artefacts created and used by humans and events), relations between individuals, worth, authorities, and rules of activities.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Space station and space shuttle are advanced Cyber-Physical Systems.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Data is continually collected through sensors deployed in the physical space (e.g., temperature meters and cameras) and in socio space (e.g., ticket machines and mobile phones).</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>The motion energy originates from thought in mental space.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>It contains more and more data, which indicates physical space, social space and itself to a certain extent [3].</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>For example, unhealthy individual or community in once space will influence the health of individuals or communities in another space.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>More subspaces of the symbol space were created.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>CPSoc is an existence in form of a complex space.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>The Resource Space Model locates resources in multi-dimensional classification space and supports zooming on classification hierarchies [13] and [18].</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>In CPSoc, different spaces obey different laws, physical laws do not hold in cyberspace and socio space, but individuals in different spaces can interact with each other or influence one another following some common laws.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>The integration of the classification space and the semantic link network supports navigation with the features of triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating, and zooming through spaces.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Resources in different spaces can be self-organized in a multi-dimensional classification space.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Actually, human society plays very important role in forming and evolving the complex space.</a>
