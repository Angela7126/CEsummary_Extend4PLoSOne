<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Semantic Link Network (SLN) is a loosely coupled semantic data model for managing Web resources with the following main features of the Web:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A relational data model is limited in representing rich semantic relationships between various resources and supporting reasoning on semantic relations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>RDF Schema (RDFS, www.w3.org/TR/2004/ REC-rdf-schema-20040210) defines a set of syntaxes to store the metadata of resources with XML syntax and provides basic RDF vocabularies for structuring RDF resources.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A query on semantic link networks is a new semantic link network from a combination of some operations of union, intersection, reasoning, selection, projection, or join.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is easy to verify that all closures of the single semantic link types construct a classification for the semantic link types of the SLN schema, and we can decompose an SLN schema based on such a classification.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The projection operation enables a user or application to operate a semantic link network from different schemas, enables a semantic link network to suit different schemas for different applications, and enables reasoning on a semantic link network to be localized on a relevant schema.</a>
