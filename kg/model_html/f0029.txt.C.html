<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Cross-match spatially clusters and organizes several astronomical point-source measurements from one or more surveys.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ideally, each object would be found in each survey.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Unfortunately, the observation conditions and the objects themselves change continually.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even some stationary objects are missing in some observations;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>sometimes objects have a variable light flux and sometimes the seeing is worse.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In most cases we are faced with a substantial number of differences in object detections between surveys and between observations taken at different times within the same survey or instrument.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Dealing with such missing observations is a difficult problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The first step is to classify misses as ephemeral -- when the object moved or simply disappeared, masked -- when noise hid or corrupted the object observation, or edge -- when the object was near the edge of the observational field.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This classification and a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational footprints help construct a Match table recording both hits and misses.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Transitive closure clusters friends-of-friends into object bundles.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The bundle summary statistics are recorded in a Bundle table.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This design is an evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-match design that compared overlapping observations taken at different times.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This approach to classifying and organizing a series of point-source spatial observations addresses the problem faced by astronomers doing a cross-match of multiple runs -- either within a survey or between dissimilar surveys.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Similar problems arise in other domains.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Dealing with missing data is the most difficult problem.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The first step is to classifying misses as ephemeral -- meaning that the object moved or appeared or disappeared or was at the detection threshold, masked -- meaning that the object was hidden or corrupted by noise in the observation, or edge -- meaning that the object was near the edge of the observational field.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This classification combined with a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational footprints and masks can construct of a Match table recording both hits and misses.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The matches can be extended by transitive-closure to friends-of-friends all occupy approximately the same region.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This transitive closure partitions all the observations into disjoint bundles.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Information summarizing information about all the observations of an object can then be recorded in a Bundle table.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The resulting schema is shown in Figure 3.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The design described here evolved from the MatchHead-Match table cross-match implemented for SDSS Data Release 5 [6] and described in [5]</a>
