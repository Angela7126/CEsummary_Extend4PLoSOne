<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Discovering, managing, and utilizing such knowledge are advanced services of the e-science knowledge grid environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including resoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Encouraging unselfish cooperation is another stategy that helps a knowledge flow network reach its greatest effectiveness.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Coordinating and fusing knowledge flows, data flows, and control flows, and integrating knowledge flows and workflows, are powerful means for making teamwork effective.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Exploring the universe and human society are great challenges of 21st century science.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This article explores the dynamic nature of knowledge, the power to promote and influence the development of human society, and the future interconnection environment.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It describes an important approach to automatically discovering knowledge flow networks within scientific documents and activities.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Such networks embody an autonomous knowledge grid, which supports individual and cooperative scientific research, helps investigate the evolution of knowledge and disciplines, and assists in planning for scientific research development.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Using the rules of knowledge flow makes teamwork more effective and innovative, not only in an e-science environment but also in team management, as knowledge flow networking can generate knowledge during operation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, many other scientific and technological issues relevant to knowledge flow, including human, philosophical, psychological, cognitive, economical, social, and management issues, are yet to be resolved, and are a major challenge to scientists.</a>
