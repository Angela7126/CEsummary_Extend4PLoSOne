<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Big data research has attracted great attention in science, technology, industry and society.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is developing with the evolving scientific paradigm, the fourth industrial revolution, and the transformational innovation of technologies.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, its nature and fundamental challenge have not been recognized, and its own methodology has not been formed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper explores and answers the following questions:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>What is big data?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>What are the basic methods for representing, managing and analyzing big data?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>What is the relationship between big data and knowledge?</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Can we find a mapping from big data into knowledge space?</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>What kind of infrastructure is required to support not only big data management and analysis but also knowledge discovery, sharing and management?</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>What is the relationship between big data and science paradigm?</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>What is the nature and fundamental challenge of big data computing?</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A multi-dimensional perspective is presented toward a methodology of big data computing.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The big data surge emerges with the symphony of the ongoing revolution of technologies, the 4th paradigm of science, the 4th industry revolution, the globalization of economy, and the transformation of cities, which leads to profound social reforms.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Big data research tries to use and develop information technologies to extend human sensory to form a more realistic view of the world.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>From the macroscopic point of view, big data surge reflects the current development stage of science, technology and engineering that any discipline is not able to provide necessary knowledge for recognizing the rules of complex systems or solving complex problems.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Acquiring new knowledge requests the fusion of sciences, technologies, engineering and methods.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>From the system point of view, big data reflect the status of a complex system.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The fundamental problem is that humans have limited knowledge to establish accurate model for some complex systems such as society and economy because individual knowledge is too narrow to fully understand the complex systems.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Big data provide more facts for understanding those systems.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>From the data point of view, big data research concerns the following three issues:</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>(1) management, which concerns collection, verification, organization, storage, and operations;</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>(2) exploration, which is to discover various relations and patterns in data and understand system behaviors on data;</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>and, (3) services, which concern the development of services on big data including question-answering, recommendation, summarization, etc.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>An evolving cognitive cyber-infrastructure can provide the state-of-the-art technologies for enabling data-intensive research and inspiring knowledge generation and innovation with big data distributed in different institutions.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The Community of Cognition and Practice and the Cognitive Cyber-Infrastructure interact and co-evolve to provide a better environment for minds to discover knowledge.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The development of computer emerges various research methodologies:</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>rationalism like Turing machine, empiricism like data mining, social constructionism like World Wide Web and Wikipedia, and pragmatism like utility computing and cloud computing.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The transformation from big data to knowledge needs a multi-dimensional methodology that absorbs and fuses the advantages of rationalism, empiricism, social constructionism, and pragmatism (Zhuge, 2012).</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Big data surge arouses the requirement for new scientific and engineering methodology.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The driving force is the desire of the knowledge that can transform society.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The study of unconventional mapping from big data into knowledge space invokes rethinking of traditional philosophical problems (e.g., the Plato's problem), scientific problems and technical problems towards a new methodology.</a>
