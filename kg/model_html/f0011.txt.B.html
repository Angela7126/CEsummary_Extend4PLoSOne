<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The study of interaction is more fundamental than the study of symbolic languages as humans can effectively interact with each other before the invention of symbol languages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The study of interactive semantics will open a new door of civilization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Interactive semantics consists of an open, self-organized and evolving social interactive system and its semantic image.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The semantic image records the evolution of the system so it enables the system as well as its individuals and machines to behave with knowing their present and past.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Individuals interact with each other based on the semantic worldview, interactive semantic base, processes of building and explaining semantic image, and instinct control mechanism.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The semantic lens extends individual ability to build and retrieve semantic image from different facets, abstraction levels and scales through time.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Social indication and explanation help build semantic images.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Signi u'\ufb01' cant semantic images emerge with the evolution of the interactive system according to the centrality, the richness principle, the simplest principle, the distinguish principle and the relevance principle.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The adaptive classi u'\ufb01' cation space and the self-organized semantic link network are uni u'\ufb01' ed in the semantic lens to extend individual ability to build, retrieve and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A semantic link network re u'\ufb02' ects not only the relations between objects but also the formation process of semantic image.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>More semantic models can be incorporated into the semantic lens to extend the ability of managing resources organized in different models.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Actually, a semantic model is effective only when it re u'\ufb02' ects the essence of organizing artifacts and semantic images of individual and society.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Turing machines input and output symbols according to pre-designed algorithms without knowing real-world meaning.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>They even do not know what they are doing, and what they have done.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The semantic worldviews, interactive semantic base and semantic images help machines know themselves and each other.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>We can imagine an interactive machine that can actively input a set of symbols and then generate the corresponding semantic image, or input a semantic image and then generate the corresponding symbols, without special-purpose algorithm.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>For the same input, different machines may generate different outputs.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>We can further imagine the future cyber-society where individuals can access their semantic images of different times, interact with the semantic images of communities and artifacts to know all relevant stories, and participate in discussion through generations.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The future cyber-society will preserve rather complete semantic images of individuals and society, help individuals to sense the human-level semantics during interaction, and allow individuals to know panorama social existence and evolution.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The study of interactive semantics will help create the future cyber-society.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The following issues are worth further studying:</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>(1) Automatically capturing and evolving various semantic images.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>(2) Automatically generating and adapting classi u'\ufb01' cation spaces.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(3) Multi-channel interactions using diverse symbol systems.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>(4) Interactive semantics management for effective interaction.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>(5) General system development method and environment based on interaction.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>(6) The semantic lens that integrates various semantic models.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(7) Multi-disciplinary study on human models and society models, which help realize machine-level AI + human-level AI + society-level AI.</a>
