<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Scientists in all domains face a data avalanche -- both from better instruments and from improved simulations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We believe that computer science tools and computer scientists are in a position to help all the sciences by building tools and developing techniques to manage, analyze, and visualize peta-scale scientific information.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This article is summarizes our experiences over the last seven years trying to bridge the gap between database technology and the needs of the astronomy community in building the World-Wide Telescope.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We began by commenting that science is changing and that computer-science is in a position to help its sister sciences manage the impending data avalanche.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One question we sought to answer was:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Can databases help?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The simple answer is:</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Yes, if ...</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The astronomers for example needed a few things not part of the standard packages (spherical spatial data access, statistical functions, ...</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>, and they needed database expertise to help them bridge the gap between their problem and our technology.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The sciences also face data mining and data visualization challenges that we have not addressed here (beyond pointing out how important they are.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This is literally a golden opportunity for Computer Science to make a contribution if we will take the time to work with our colleagues in X for almost any science X.</a>
