<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Science centers that curate and serve science data are emerging around next-generation science instruments.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The world-wide telescope, GenBank, and the BaBar collaborations are prototypes of this trend.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One group of scientists is collecting the data and managing these archives.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A larger group of scientists are exploring these archives the way previous generations explored their private data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Often the results of the analysis are fed back to the archive to add to the corpus.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Good metadata becomes central for data sharing among different disciplines and for data analysis and visualization tools.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>There is a convergence of the nascent-databases (HDF, NetCDF, FITS, ...</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>which focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The traditional systems have the virtues of automatic parallelism, indexing, and non-procedural access, but they need to embrace the data types of the science community and need to co-exist with data in file systems.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Three technical advances will be crucial to scientific analysis:</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) extensive metadata and metadata standards that will make it easy to discover what data exists, make it easy for people and programs to understand the data, and make it easy to track data lineage;</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(2) great analysis tools that allow scientists to easily ask questions, and to easily understand and visualize the answers;</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>and (3) set-oriented data parallelism access supported by new indexing schemes and new algorithms that allow us to interactively explore peta-scale datasets.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The goal is a smart notebook that empowers scientists to explore the world's data.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Science data centers with computational resources to explore huge data archives will be central to enabling such notebooks.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Because data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Consequently, science centers will remain the core vehicle and federations will likely be secondary.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Science centers will provide both the archives and the institutional infrastructure to develop these peta-scale archives and the algorithms and tools to analyze them.</a>
