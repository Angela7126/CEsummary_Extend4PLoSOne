<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper reexamines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage systems.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Briefly, it looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Amdahl's ratio laws for system design need only slight revision after 35 years -- the major change being the increased use of RAM.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An analysis also indicates storage should be used to cache both database and web data to save disk bandwidth, network bandwidth, and people's time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Surprisingly, the 5-minute rule for disk caching becomes a cache -- everything rule for web caching.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Data stores will become huge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Our biggest challenge is to make it easy to access and manage them.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Automating all the tasks of data organization, accesses, and protection.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Disk technology is overtaking tapes, but at the same time disks are morphing into tape-like devices with primarily sequential access to optimize the use of disk arms.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Meanwhile, RAM improvements encourage us to build machines with massive main memory.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Indeed, the main change to Amdahl's balanced system law is that alpha (=MIPS/RAM size) is rising from 1 to 10.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Network bandwidth is improving at a rate that challenges many of our design assumptions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>LAN/SAN software is being streamlined so it is no longer the bottleneck.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This may well allow a re -centralization of computing.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Still, data caching is an important optimization.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Disk caching still follows the 5-minute random rule and the one-minute sequential rule.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Web caching encourages designs that simply cache all pages.</a>
