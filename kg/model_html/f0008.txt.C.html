<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To create a unified model that can effectively manage resources in different spaces is a challenge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Resource Space Model RSM is to manage versatile resources with a multi-dimensional classification space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It supports generalization and specialization on multi-dimensional classifications.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This paper introduces the basic concepts of RSM, and proposes the Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P-RSM, to deal with uncertainty in managing various resources in different spaces of the cyber-physical society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>P-RSM's normal forms, operations and integrity constraints are developed to support effective management of the resource space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Characteristics of the P-RSM are analyzed through experiments.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This model also enables various services to be described, discovered and composed from multiple dimensions and abstraction levels with normal form and integrity guarantees.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Some extensions and applications of the P-RSM are introduced.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Resource Space Model RSM is a general model for organizing and managing various resources with multi-dimensional classifications.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>By mapping the RSM into the probabilistic space, this paper establishes the Probabilistic Resource Space Model P-RSM, which can organize and manage various resources with uncertainty by multi-dimensional classifications.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The normal forms, operations, and integrity constraints are extended under probabilistic condition.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The P-RSM can manage uncertain classifications, support flexible queries, and acquire satisfied query performance.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It also enables different resource spaces to be merged or separated with certain normal form and integrity constraint guarantees.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The formation and evolution of natural species can also be viewed from the angle of continuous multi-dimensional classification.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Classification is also the most basic method for humans to understand, organize and manage various resources in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>P-RSM can be the basic model for organizing various resources in the cyber-physical society.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Humans consciously and subconsciously wave semantic link networks in the cyber, physical, socio and mental spaces, and carry out reasoning while co-experiencing in these spaces in lifetime.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A complex semantic space model integrating RSM and SLN reflects the nature of the cyber-physical society.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It is suitable for organizing and managing various resources in the cyber-physical society.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Since the complex semantic space model reflects the fundamental intelligent mechanisms u'\u23af' classification, link and reasoning, it also supports cyber-physical-socio intelligence [42].</a>
