<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Logical AI develops computer programs that represent what they know about the world primarily by logical formulas and decide what to do primarily by logical reasoning|including nonmonotonic logical reasoning.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is convenient to use logical sentences and terms whose meaning depends on context.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The reasons for this are similar to what causes human language to use context dependent meanings.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This note gives elements of some of the formalisms to which we have been led.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Fuller treatments are in [McC93], [Guh91] and [MB94] and the references cited in the Web page [Buv95].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The first main idea is to make contexts first class objects in the logic and use the formula ist(c,p) to assert that the proposition p is true in the context c.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A second idea is to formalize how propositions true in one context transform when they are moved to different but related contexts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>An ability to transcend the outermost context is needed to give computer programs the ability to reason about the totality of all they have thought about so far [McC96].</a>
