<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It is easiest to uderstand the ascription of thoughts to machines in circumstances when we also understand the machine in physical terms.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, the payoff comes when either no-one or only an expert understands the machine physically.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, we must be careful not to ascribe properties to a machine that the particular machine doesn't have.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We humans can easily fool ourselves when there is something we want to believe.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The mental qualities of present machines are not the same as ours.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While we will probably be able, in the future, to make machines with mental qualities more like our own, we'll probably never want to deal with machines that are too much like us.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Who wants to deal with a computer that loses its temper, or an automatic teller that falls in love?</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Computers will end up with the psychology that is convenient to their designers -- (and they'll be fascist bastards if those designers don't think twice).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Program designers have a tendency to think of the users as idiots who need to be controlled.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>They should rather think of their program as a servant, whose master, the user, should be able to control it.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If designers and programmers think about the apparent mental qualities that their programs will have, they'll create programs that are easier and pleasanter -- more humane -- to deal with.</a>
