<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>How the ideal environment human beings live and work is like, what are its distinguished characteristics and basic laws, and what is the basis of future intelligence are fundamental scientific issues.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The CP3SME is a complex space, where diverse spaces emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It aims at an ideal environment for human beings to live and work, and concerns diversity, dynamicity, harmony and sustainability.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Linking within and through spaces, emerging semantic images, and reasoning at different levels and facets are basic motions of the environment.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The following are four levels of pursuits of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms such as relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features such as self-organized peer-to-peer linking and high-performance routing, semantic communities and emerging principles, pervasive and effect-aware linking, and link recommendation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(3) Realizing semantic lens by integrating with the multi-dimensional classification space [89].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(4) Exploring the general linking methodology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This concerns new philosophical thinking, interactive computing model, nature of the complex linking such as dynamicity, symmetry and rules of various flows, the methods for improving various closed loops, and the methods for coordinating spaces, controlling and predicting evolution.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Machine intelligence, human intelligence, and socio intelligence are extended in the complex space by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The ideal of Bush has been realized with the development of the Web and various advanced Web applications.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The ideal of Gray's personal memex and world memex will be realized in the near future with the development of the next-generation Web.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>But it is still hard to realize Turing's ideal on intelligent machine.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Exploring the CP3SME will go beyond Turing's ideal since traditional machines and the cyber space are limited in ability to realize the CP3SME and cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In CP3SME, research objects and conditions of many disciplines will be changed.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Methodologies in respective disciplines are not suitable for research and develop the environment.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Multi-disciplinary study will lead to breakthrough in sciences, technologies, engineering and philosophy.</a>
