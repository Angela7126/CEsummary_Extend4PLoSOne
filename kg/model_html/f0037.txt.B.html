<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>I have argued that we have a good story or at least good promises on many fronts, but that we have some major flaws in the story:</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>* Availability now hinges on</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) Automating management so that human error is less of a factor in configuring and operating computer systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Fending off hacker-attacks and other forms of sabotage.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This was once a remote possibility, but today most popular websites are continuously under attack from dozens of adversaries at a time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Some of these adversaries are very competent and very expert.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>* After functionality (actually getting the application to work), manageability is the dominant cost of operating most systems -- there is no Moore's law for people.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Yet the operations cost fall in concert with the reduced costs of hardware, software, networking, and faculties.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The only way to do this is to automate these tasks.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>* Agility is a special form of functionality.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Agility is on the macro-level what we used to call extensibility on the micro-level.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>* Scalability is addressed by manageability</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So, the new role for "systems people" like you (if you got this far in the paper) and me is to focus on functionality, manageability, and defensive service.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Making self-managing and self-healing systems, and making systems that detect and resist sabotage stand as our greatest system building challenge.</a>
