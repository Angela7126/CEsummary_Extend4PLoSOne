<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Well-defined intellectual problems cam be regarded as those of inverting functions and partial functions defined by Turing machines.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If we are given a Turing machine and the output of it, is there anyway to find out the input?</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That is, can we find the inversion function defined by this Turing machine?</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This work intended to discuss such a question.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, we discuss the existence of inversion function on some conditions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then we tried to improve the purely enumerative method's efficiency taking into account some of the structure of Turing machines.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In order to discuss this problem, we also attempted to precisely define the meaning of efficiency.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Finally we listed some place worthy of remark in the last part.</a>
