<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>What is semantics?</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>People in different areas view semantics from different facets although it accompanies interaction through civilization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some researchers believe that humans have some innate structure in mind for processing semantics.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Then, what the structure is like?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Some argue that humans evolve a structure for processing semantics through constant learning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Then, how the process is like?</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Humans have invented various symbol systems to represent semantics.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Can semantics be accurately represented?</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Turing machines are good at processing symbols according to algorithms designed by humans, but they are limited in ability to process semantics and to do active interaction.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Super computers and high-speed networks do not help solve this issue as they do not have any semantic worldview and cannot re u'\ufb02' ect themselves.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Can future cyber-society have some semantic images that enable machines and individuals (humans and agents) to re u'\ufb02' ect themselves and interact with each other with knowing social situation through time?</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This paper concerns these issues in the context of studying an interactive semantics for the future cyber-society.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It u'\ufb01' rstly distinguishes social semantics from natural semantics, and then explores the interactive semantics in the category of social semantics.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Interactive semantics consists of an interactive system and its semantic image, which co-evolve and in u'\ufb02' uence each other.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The semantic worldview and interactive semantic base are proposed as the semantic basis of interaction.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The process of building and explaining semantic image can be based on an evolving structure incorporating adaptive multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space and self-organized semantic link network.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>A semantic lens is proposed to enhance the potential of the structure and help individuals build and retrieve semantic images from different facets, abstraction levels and scales through time.</a>
