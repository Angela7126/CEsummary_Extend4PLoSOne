<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Cross-match spatially clusters and organizes several astronomical point-source measurements from one or more surveys.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ideally, each object would be found in each survey.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Unfortunately, the observation conditions and the objects themselves change continually.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even some stationary objects are missing in some observations;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>sometimes objects have a variable light flux and sometimes the seeing is worse.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In most cases we are faced with a substantial number of differences in object detections between surveys and between observations taken at different times within the same survey or instrument.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Dealing with such missing observations is a difficult problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The first step is to classify misses as ephemeral -- when the object moved or simply disappeared, masked -- when noise hid or corrupted the object observation, or edge -- when the object was near the edge of the observational field.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This classification and a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational footprints help construct a Match table recording both hits and misses.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Transitive closure clusters friends-of-friends into object bundles.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The bundle summary statistics are recorded in a Bundle table.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This design is an evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-match design that compared overlapping observations taken at different times.</a>
