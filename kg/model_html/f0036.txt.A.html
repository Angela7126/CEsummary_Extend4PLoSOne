<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This paper reexamines the rules of thumb for the design of data storage systems.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Briefly, it looks at storage, processing, and networking costs, ratios, and trends with a particular focus on performance and price/performance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Amdahl's ratio laws for system design need only slight revision after 35 years -- the major change being the increased use of RAM.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An analysis also indicates storage should be used to cache both database and web data to save disk bandwidth, network bandwidth, and people's time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Surprisingly, the 5-minute rule for disk caching becomes a cache -- everything rule for web caching.</a>
