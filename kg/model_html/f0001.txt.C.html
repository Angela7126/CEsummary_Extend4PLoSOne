<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Summarization is one of the key features of human intelligence.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It plays an important role in understanding and representation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Further, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The basic viewpoints include:</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(1) a representation suitable for summarization should have a core, indicated by its intention and extension;</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) summarization is an open process of various interactions, involved in various explicit and implicit citations;</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>and, (3) the form of summary is diverse and summarization carries out through multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Summarization is an open representation of representation, in diverse forms, from multiple dimensions, and through interactions in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The basic interactions include selecting, citing and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Texts have been the major means to reflect the evolution of human society.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It is necessary to explore automatic summarization of texts expanding rapidly in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, existing approaches are empirical, mainly relying on statistics, structure and linguistic analysis while neglecting the nature of representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This paper summarizes previous approaches and explores the fundamental theory and method for summarization from multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The core viewpoint is that summarization is carried out with various interactions involved in human, machine, and various representations including text, picture, and video.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Writers and readers represent mainly through explicit or implicit citations.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Studying the summarization of pictures, videos and graphs reaches a general summarization method.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>It is hard for automatic summarization systems to realize human-level summarization as it concerns the essential natural and social differences between human and the systems.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Putting summarization into a human-machine-nature symbiotic network is a way to make a breakthrough.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>A significant progress of summarization research relies on an innovative summarization of philosophy, psychology, linguistics, cognitive science, neuroscience, physics, computer science, and artificial intelligence from multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>This work is an attempt to help broaden the scope of summarization research and inspire cross-disciplinary research to develop this area.</a>
