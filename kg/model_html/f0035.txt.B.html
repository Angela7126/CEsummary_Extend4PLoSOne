<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The primary goal of the World Wide Telescope is to make Astronomers more productive and to allow them to better understand their data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But, it is also an archetype for the evolution of Computational Science from its simulation roots to the broader field of capturing, organizing, analyzing, exploring, and visualizing scientific data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The World Wide Telescope is a prototype for this new role, but similar trends are happening in genomics, in economics, in ecology, and in most other sciences.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This transformation poses interesting challenges to the database community which will have to deal with huge datasets, with richer datatypes, and with much more complex queries.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Federating the archives is a good test of our distributed systems technologies like web services and distributed object stores.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The WWT poses a challenge to the data mining community since these datasets are so huge and the data has such high dimensionality.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is an excellent place to compare and evaluate new datamining algorithms, since the data is public.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is a challenge to statisticians to develop algorithms that run fast on very large datasets.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The WWT also poses the challenge of making it easy to visually explore the data, posing queries in natural ways, and seeing the answers in intuitive formats.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Last but perhaps most important, the WWT can be a valuable resource to teach the new astronomy and also to teach computational science.</a>
