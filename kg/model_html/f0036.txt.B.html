<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Data stores will become huge.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our biggest challenge is to make it easy to access and manage them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Automating all the tasks of data organization, accesses, and protection.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Disk technology is overtaking tapes, but at the same time disks are morphing into tape-like devices with primarily sequential access to optimize the use of disk arms.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Meanwhile, RAM improvements encourage us to build machines with massive main memory.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Indeed, the main change to Amdahl's balanced system law is that alpha (=MIPS/RAM size) is rising from 1 to 10.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Network bandwidth is improving at a rate that challenges many of our design assumptions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>LAN/SAN software is being streamlined so it is no longer the bottleneck.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This may well allow a re -centralization of computing.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Still, data caching is an important optimization.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Disk caching still follows the 5-minute random rule and the one-minute sequential rule.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Web caching encourages designs that simply cache all pages.</a>
