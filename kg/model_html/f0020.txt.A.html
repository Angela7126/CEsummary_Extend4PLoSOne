<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We propose to extend the ontology of logical AI to include approximate objects, approximate predicates and approximate theories.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Besides the ontology we treat the relations among different approximate theories of the same phenomena.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Approximate predicates can't have complete if-and-only-if definitions and usually don't even have definite extensions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some approximate concepts can be refined by learning more and some by defining more and some by both, but it isn't possible in general to make them well-defined.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Approximate concepts are essential for representing common sense knowledge and doing common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Assertions involving approximate concepts can be represented in mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A sentence involving an approximate concept may have a definite truth value even if the concept is ill-defined.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is definite that Mount Everest was climbed in 1953 even though exactly what rock and ice is included in that mountain is ill-defined.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Likewise, it harms a mosquito to be swatted, although we haven't a sharp notion of what it means to harm a mosquito.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Whatif(x,p), which denotes what x would be like if p were true, is an important kind of approximate object.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The article treats successively approximate objects, approximate theories, and formalisms for describing how one object or theory approximates another.</a>
