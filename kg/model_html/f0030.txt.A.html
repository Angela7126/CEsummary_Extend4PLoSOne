<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Astronomy is a wonderful Grid application because datasets are inherently distributed and yet form a fairly uniform corpus.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In particular:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) The astronomy community has a fairly unified taxonomy, vocabulary, and codified definition of metrics and units [24].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Modern data is carefully peer reviewed and collected with rigorous statistical and scientific standards.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) Data provenance is tracked, and derived data sets are curated fairly carefully.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(4) Most data is publicly available and will remain available for the foreseeable future.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(5) Even though old data is much less precise than current data, old data is essential when studying time-varying phenomena.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Each astronomy archive covers part of the electromagnetic spectrum for a period of time and a subset of the celestial sphere.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>All the archives are from the same sky and the same celestial objects, although different observations are made at different times.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Increasingly, astronomers perform multispectral studies or temporal studies combining data related to the same objects from multiple instruments and archives.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Cross-comparison is possible because data are well documented and schematized with a common reference frame, and have clear provenance.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The scale of the data -- terabytes now, petabytes soon -- means that most data must reside at archives managed by the teams that are gathering and publishing the data.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>An astronomer wanting to study a particular kind of object or phenomenon cannot download a full copy of each archive for local processing -- both because the scientist does not have a spare local petabyte and because it would take too long to do the download.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Rather, the scientist must request small (gigabyte-sized now, terabyte-sized in the future) subsets from each archive that represent the few million objects of interest out of the billions at the archives.</a>
