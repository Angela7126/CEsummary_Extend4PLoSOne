<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The physical space provides material basis for the generation and evolution of living beings.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Humans have created various artefacts and spaces to realize the meaning of life.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Social space has been evolving with the development of human beings.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Humans have invented versatile technologies and created cyberspace with development of information technology.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Cyberspace is being linked to versatile individuals in physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A complex space of cyberspace, physical space and social space j Cyber-Physical Society (CPSoc) j is being formed.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Exploring CPSoc needs a new methodology since the principles and methods specific to cyberspace, physical space and social space will not be suitable for exploring the new space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is necessary to explore the basic concept of CPSoc, its distinguished characteristics and scientific issues.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Research on CPSoc will lead to the revolution of society, science and engineering.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>How our future living space is like is a major concern of sciences.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Cyber-Physical Society (CPSoc) is a science, technology and engineering for the future society.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) Science.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The formation of scientific thought in individual mental space and propagation through mental spaces can be retrieved through rich and vivid historical semantic images, so do research activities involved in physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This will greatly help scientific research since scientists can access research objects and thoughts as well as their formation processes through super-links.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This means that scientists can not only communicate with peers but also access thoughts of scientists through time.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Scientists can not only use language to express thoughts but also link thoughts to symbols in papers, to research process, and to possible applications.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This will also lead to a revolution of publication.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Currently, some publishers allow authors to attach slides to papers.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>In the future, live scenarios will be embedded in papers, which demonstrate research processes including experiments.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Scientific thoughts will effectively influence society through super-links between spaces.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>(2) Education.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Students can learn natural physical principles and socio knowledge not only from linguistic description and mathematical description in textbooks but also from live physical phenomena or socio events through super-links.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>How to sense various physical phenomena and social events are challenging issues.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Knowledge is formed, enhanced and rebuilt through interaction between coherent motions in and through spaces.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Questioning, answering and explaining will be carried out through spaces.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>(3) Engineering.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Artificial systems will be linked to manufacturers, ideas, design processes, and manufacturing processes while interacting with humans (designers, engineers and users).</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The statuses of systems can also be monitored in lifetime so that necessary maintenance can be carried out on time to ensure healthy status.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Function, structure, designer, owner, developer, and even economic, ecological and socio effects will be accessible.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>All spaces will cooperatively reflect the formation processes of artificial systems when they are required, designed, built, sold, used, and recycled.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>(4) History and culture.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be reflected and preserved as semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Evidences of historical and cultural research will be easily available.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Both material culture and non-material culture will be preserved not only in physical space but also in cyberspace and social space virtually.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Recommendation or evaluation will be explained from historical and cultural point of view.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>Science fiction will not only exhibit imagination in text and cyberspace but also super-link to history and culture.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>(5) Society and life.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals, communities, and events will have semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Health of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be super-linked to measures.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Evaluation result will be super-linked to socio influence through time.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Cyber-Physical Society will also help individuals to fulfil all aspects of the meaning of life:</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>love, work, entertainment, etc.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>(6) Green and harmonious social environment.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Cyber-Physical Society will be efficient and low carbon as it will ensure optimal coordination between knowledge flow, information flow, material flow, energy flow and value flow through spaces.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>The cycle between consumption and production can be established to minimize the waste of material and energy with awareness of the super-links between materials, socio requirements, innovation, influence, production, and physical space.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>The energy cost of computing will be taken into account in multiple spaces rather than just in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Human will be in the Cyber-Physical-Social process to co-evolve with cyberspace, physical space and social space [8].</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Human will also be out of the process to develop mind and foresee the future.</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>(7) Interactive virtual presence.</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>Individuals can interact with each other through spaces.</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>Children at home can feel the presence of their parents who are in office through multiple types of super-links, and parents can know the situations of children, and be alarmed when special cases happen.</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>Senior people can feel the presence of their children and relatives who live in different places.</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>Patients in rural areas can see doctors in major cities and obtain treatment through super-links.</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>(8) Multi-space optimization.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>Making optimization in multiple spaces is important in Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>For example, energy supplies will super-link to requirements, road maps, real-time energy consumption situation, parking spaces, and environmental status.</a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>Traffic jam will be avoided through knowing real-time situation and certain socio priority.</a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>Vehicles can be guided to appropriate parking according to intentions and minimization of energy consumption.</a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>The revolution of Cyber-Physical Society will also bring security issue.</a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>As human behaviours will influence the physical space and society through cyberspace, security will be cross spaces.</a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>Another issue is how to keep a sustainable development of cyberspace so that it can harmoniously evolve with society, otherwise it may form negative influence on society.</a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>The complex space evolves with various interactions for cooperation and isolation.</a>
