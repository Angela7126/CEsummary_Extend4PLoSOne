<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Until we all have inexpensive end-to-end gigabit speed networks, terascale datasets will have to move over some form of sneaker net.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We suspect that by the time the promised end-to-end gigabit NGI arrives, we will be moving petabyte scale datasets and so will still need a sneaker net solution.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given that, the real choice is disk, or tape, or brick.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We believe that the speed, convenience, and compatibility of bricks will make them the medium of choice in the future.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Storage bricks can also be used for data interchange, for data archiving (send the whole brick to Iron Mountain), and for backup/restore.</a>
