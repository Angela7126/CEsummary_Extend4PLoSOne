<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This approach to classifying and organizing a series of point-source spatial observations addresses the problem faced by astronomers doing a cross-match of multiple runs -- either within a survey or between dissimilar surveys.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Similar problems arise in other domains.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Dealing with missing data is the most difficult problem.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The first step is to classifying misses as ephemeral -- meaning that the object moved or appeared or disappeared or was at the detection threshold, masked -- meaning that the object was hidden or corrupted by noise in the observation, or edge -- meaning that the object was near the edge of the observational field.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This classification combined with a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational footprints and masks can construct of a Match table recording both hits and misses.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The matches can be extended by transitive-closure to friends-of-friends all occupy approximately the same region.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This transitive closure partitions all the observations into disjoint bundles.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Information summarizing information about all the observations of an object can then be recorded in a Bundle table.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The resulting schema is shown in Figure 3.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The design described here evolved from the MatchHead-Match table cross-match implemented for SDSS Data Release 5 [6] and described in [5]</a>
