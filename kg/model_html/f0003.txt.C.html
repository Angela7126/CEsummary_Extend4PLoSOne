<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Humans consciously and subconsciously establish various links, emerge semantic images and reason in mind, learn linking effect and rules,select linked individuals to interact, and form closed loops through links while co-experiencing in multiple spaces in lifetime.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Machines are limited in these abilities although various graph-based models have been used to link resources in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The following are fundamental limitations of machine intelligence:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) machines know little link and rules in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space, so it is not realistic to expect machines to discover laws and solve problems in these spaces;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and, (2) machines can only process pre-designed algorithms and data structures in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>They are limited in ability to go beyond the cyber space, to learn linking rules, to know the effect of linking, and to explain computing results according to physical, physiological, psychological and socio laws.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Linking various spaces will create a complex space -- the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-SocioMental Environment CP3SME.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Diverse spaces will emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>From multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyberphysical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The methodology includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The CP3SME aims at an ideal environment for humans to live and work.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Exploration will go beyond previous ideals on intelligence and computing.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>How the ideal environment human beings live and work is like, what are its distinguished characteristics and basic laws, and what is the basis of future intelligence are fundamental scientific issues.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The CP3SME is a complex space, where diverse spaces emerge, evolve, compete and cooperate with each other.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It aims at an ideal environment for human beings to live and work, and concerns diversity, dynamicity, harmony and sustainability.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Linking within and through spaces, emerging semantic images, and reasoning at different levels and facets are basic motions of the environment.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The following are four levels of pursuits of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms such as relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features such as self-organized peer-to-peer linking and high-performance routing, semantic communities and emerging principles, pervasive and effect-aware linking, and link recommendation.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(3) Realizing semantic lens by integrating with the multi-dimensional classification space [89].</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>(4) Exploring the general linking methodology.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>This concerns new philosophical thinking, interactive computing model, nature of the complex linking such as dynamicity, symmetry and rules of various flows, the methods for improving various closed loops, and the methods for coordinating spaces, controlling and predicting evolution.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Machine intelligence, human intelligence, and socio intelligence are extended in the complex space by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence includes new models, principles, mechanisms, scientific issues, and philosophical explanation.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The ideal of Bush has been realized with the development of the Web and various advanced Web applications.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The ideal of Gray's personal memex and world memex will be realized in the near future with the development of the next-generation Web.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>But it is still hard to realize Turing's ideal on intelligent machine.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Exploring the CP3SME will go beyond Turing's ideal since traditional machines and the cyber space are limited in ability to realize the CP3SME and cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>In CP3SME, research objects and conditions of many disciplines will be changed.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Methodologies in respective disciplines are not suitable for research and develop the environment.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Multi-disciplinary study will lead to breakthrough in sciences, technologies, engineering and philosophy.</a>
