<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Classification is the most basic method for organizing resources in the physical space, cyber space, socio space and mental space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To create a unified model that can effectively manage resources in different spaces is a challenge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The Resource Space Model RSM is to manage versatile resources with a multi-dimensional classification space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It supports generalization and specialization on multi-dimensional classifications.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This paper introduces the basic concepts of RSM, and proposes the Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P-RSM, to deal with uncertainty in managing various resources in different spaces of the cyber-physical society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>P-RSM's normal forms, operations and integrity constraints are developed to support effective management of the resource space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Characteristics of the P-RSM are analyzed through experiments.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This model also enables various services to be described, discovered and composed from multiple dimensions and abstraction levels with normal form and integrity guarantees.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Some extensions and applications of the P-RSM are introduced.</a>
