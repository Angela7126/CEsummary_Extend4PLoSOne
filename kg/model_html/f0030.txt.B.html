<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The World Wide Telescope is an excellent Grid application.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It involves the federation of many distributed terascale data sources.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The astronomy community is interested in mining the individual datasets looking for patterns, but there is even greater interest in cross-correlating the datasets to find new phenomena.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The construction of each archive involves massive calculations that ingest, analyze, and categorize the instrument data, producing databases and files.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Cross-correlation introduces enormous requirements for data movement and computation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The emergence of these huge datasets changes the roles of authors, publishers, and curators.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Science projects become data authors and publishers, and must also do the curatorial work that will allow archives to accept and preserve the data once the project is complete.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Each project will likely publish a database that is externalized as a set of Web services.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The astronomy community is in the midst of defining and prototyping these core services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Portals will federate these Web services to provide uniform access to the archives as though they are a single distributed database.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Cross-identifications of objects across multiple archives, and searches involving both spatial and time-domain constraints, are typical tasks for the Virtual Observatory.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Because of the large sizes of the datasets, their distributed nature, and their rapidly varying content, these tasks need an architecture that is inherently distributed and scalable -- the Grid.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We view the Virtual Observatory as a small part of the larger effort of defining and applying an Open Grid Services Architecture and creating an international Grid infrastructure.</a>
