<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>CPSocio-SLN emphasizes relations, relation evolution, relational reasoning, and operation in u'\ufb02' uence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We view CPSocio-SLN as an evolution process through operations, and investigate its basic operations, completeness, and dynamicity.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The conformation sequence re u'\ufb02' ects its evolution process.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To merge two CPSocio-SLNs, their conformation sequences should be merged u'\ufb01' rst, and then calculate the minimum semantic cover and the minimum spanning graph of every semantic link based on the merged conformation sequence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>CPSocio-SLN should know its minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If there is a reasoning circulation, then a semantic link in the equivalent link set can be randomly selected and added to the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The CPSocio-SLN system can simulate the process of conformation u'\u2014' adding links to the minimum semantic cover orderly and calculating the minimum spanning graph.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The conformation information helps to know the evolution characteristics and rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The minimum semantic cover and the minimum spanning graph indicate the semantics of CPSocio-SLN as the minimum spanning graph can indicate the most important semantic links in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Since a CPSocio-SLN could be very large, the strategy for ef u'\ufb01' ciently storing and managing CPSocio-SLN based on the basic operation set is proposed to support ef u'\ufb01' cient query and maintenance.</a>
