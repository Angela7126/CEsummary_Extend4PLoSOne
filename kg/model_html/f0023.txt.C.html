<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A common feature of free will is that a person has choices among alternative actions and chooses the action with the apparently most preferred consequences.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In a determinist theory, the mechanism that makes the choice among the alternatives is determinist.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The sensation of free will comes from the fact that the mechanism that generates the choices uses a non-determinist theory as a computational device and that the stage in which the choices have been identified is introspectable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The present formalism is based on work in artificial intelligence (AI).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We present a theory of simple deterministic free will (SDFW) in a deterministic world.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The theory splits the mechanism that determines action into two parts.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The first part computes possible actions and their consequences.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then the second part decides which action is most preferable and does it.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We formalize SDFW by two sentences in situation calculus, a mathematical logical theory often used in AI.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The situation calculus formalization makes the notion of free will technical.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>According to this notion, almost no animal behavior exhibits free will, because exercising free will involves considering the consequences of alternative actions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A major advantage of our notion of free will is that whether an animal does have free will may be determinable by experiment.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Some computer programs, e.g.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>chess programs, exhibit SDFW.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Almost all do not.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>At least SDFW seems to be required for effective chess performance and also for human-level AI.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Many features usually considered as properties of free will are omitted in SDFW.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>That's what makes it simple.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The criterion for whether an entity uses SDFW is not behavioristic but is expressed in terms of the internal structure of the entity.</a>
