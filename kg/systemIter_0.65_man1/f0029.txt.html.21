<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Having the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
