<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, formalized in first order logic, because its power allows formulas that are closer to expressing the human ideas behind the proofs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Someone might argue that the decision to use set theory is creative, but I'm striving for a technical notion of creative solution, and one has to start with some background language.</a>
