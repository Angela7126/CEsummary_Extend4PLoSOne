<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The validity of this reduction depends on the following Kempe proof that if we have colored a partial map and want to add a country with four neighbors, we can always revise the coloring of the partial map to permit coloring the four neighbor country.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This leaves all the remaining countries with three or fewer neighbors, so the second cycle of reduction leaves the null map, reduced map.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>No matter how the rest of the map is colored, there is always a color available for such a country.1 We use this in to improve a Pereira-Porto map coloring program by "reducing the map" by removing such countries and doing our trial-and-error coloring on the reduced map, confident that once the reduced map is colored, the coloring can be extended to the omitted countries.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>From the point of view of logic programming, successively reducing the map by postponing countries with three or fewer neighbors is an example of a more general notion -- that of a postponable variable.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, it is also interesting to try to regard the algorithms as control attached to the Pereira-Porto logic program for coloring a specific map.</a>
