<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ever since Descartes, philosophically minded people have wrestled with the question of whether it is possible for machines to think.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In general we cannot give definitions, because the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
