<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Reflecting the development of a discipline, the distribution of knowledge energy in a network changes as its citation network evolves.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An effective knowledge flow network enables a research team to be very powerful in generating new knowledge if every node can innovate and output new knowledge to appropriate members.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Maintaining openness is a strategy for the sustainable development of knowledge flow within a research community.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This enables knowledge to flow through knowledge networks in different areas to promote interdisciplinary research.</a>
