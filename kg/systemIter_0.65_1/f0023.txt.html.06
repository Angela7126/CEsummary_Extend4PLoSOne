<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When a person, animal, or machine reacts directly to a situation rather than comparing the consequences of alternative actions, free will is not involved.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Much human action and almost all animal action reacts directly to the present situation and does not involve anticipating the consequences of alternative actions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We believe this simple theory covers the most basic phenomenon of human free will.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Human free will, i.e.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We'll call it simple deterministic free will and abbreviate it SDFW.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We can now give a situation calculus theory for SDFW illustrating the role of a non-deterministic theory in determining what will deterministically happen, i.e.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some deterministic processes consider alternative actions and their consequences and choose the actions they think have the most preferred consequences.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Actions are a special case of events, but most AI work discusses only actions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>SDFW does not require consciousness of having free will or the ability to communicate about it.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thinking about one's free will requires theoretical structure beyond or above SDFW.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As usually presented, situation calculus is a non-deterministic theory.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This deterministic decision process uses a nondeterministic theory to present the set of available actions and the consequences of each of them.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A system operating only with situation-action rules in which an action in a situation is determined directly from the characteristics of the situation does not involve free will.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Richmond Thomason in [Tho03] compares situation calculus to theories of action in the philosophical literature.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>2) The above theory captures the most basic feature of human free will.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Present programs are not conscious of their free will, however.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
