<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Moreover, just as in the map coloring problem, postponing some variables may remove enough goals involving other variables so that they in turn become postponable.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>From the point of view of logic programming, successively reducing the map by postponing countries with three or fewer neighbors is an example of a more general notion -- that of a postponable variable.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Alain Colmerauer (1981) wrote such a program for rewriting the Pereira-Porto coloring program.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Pereira and Porto (1980) give a logic program for coloring planar maps with four colors and discuss how "selective backtracking" can reduce the search involved in coloring a map from that done by a straightforward PROLOG execution of the same program.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The postponability of a variable is expressed by a postponement lemma.</a>
