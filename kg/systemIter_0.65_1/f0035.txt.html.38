<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automatically combining data from multiple data sources, each with its own data lineage, data units, data quality, and data conventions is a huge challenge.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, it will require the active participation of the many Astronomy groups that gather data and produce catalogs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the data increase a thousand fold, the work and time can grow by a factor of a million.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The multi-spectral and temporal dimensions grow data volumes to petabytes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Having built web servers that provide HTML access to the data, the next step is to federate them into an international database with transparent access to the data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The data arrives encoded as FITS files with a unique coordinate system and measurement regime [FITS].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Building the World-Wide Telescope will require skills from many disciplines.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Automatically answering this query requires a uniform naming, coordinate system, measurement units, and error handling.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It may also be a great way to teach Computational Science skills, because the data is real and well-documented, and has a strong visual component.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>SkyServer began as an attempt to make the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data easily available.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>So, automatic parallel search and good indexing technologies will be absolutely essential.</a>
