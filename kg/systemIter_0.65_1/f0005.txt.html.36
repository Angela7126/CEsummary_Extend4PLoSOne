<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Big data may mislead analysis if data are not hold by the dimensions of the observed complex system.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Big data are mapped into a data space by establishing and classifying links.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Tracing the origin of big data research and linking big data to behavior, knowledge and cyber-infrastructure is a way to explore big data methodology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Data represent things.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Establishing a multi-dimensional space to hold big data generated by the observed complex system is a basic approach to data management and analysis.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The big data of the observed system and the big data of previous research actually indicate scientific problems that need to be explored.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>dealing with big data by localizing data to the people who generate and use data.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Managing knowledge for effective data analysis is the key to generating great knowledge from analyzing data.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Some researchers proposed to develop big data research toward a science (data science), aiming at deriving valuable insights (or knowledge) from big data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>So, it requests a representation that can help human recognize the complex system that generates big data.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>As a complex system, a big country like China generates big economic data everyday, with thousands of dimensions.</a>
