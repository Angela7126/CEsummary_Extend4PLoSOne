<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to the membership probability on each coordinate, the membership probability on each axis/point in a probabilistic resource space can be calculated by the following methods.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) Search the resources in the cyber space according to the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Then, a Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P- RSM, is proposed in section 3 by mapping the RSM into the probabilistic space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A resource space with the same structure can be created in the cyber space according to the mental resource space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point is a complex probabilistic event.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Classification is the most basic method for organizing various resources in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Without knowing the relations between coordinates, and the relations between coordinate and axis, it is difficult to calculate the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point according to the membership probability that the resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>RSM enables users to operate resource spaces in the cyber space according to the classifications in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The resource space can automatically detect and upload resources by matching the pattern in resources and the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a resource management model based on multi-dimensional classifications [35][36].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This is because a resource in the probabilistic resource space can be inserted into a point if its membership probability belonging to this point is larger than 0.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(2) Discover the resource pattern in the candidate resource set according to the classification trees of the resource space and the given matching degree.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A resource space organizes resources by multi-dimensional classification according to the contents of resources, and it supports generalization and specialization on classifications.</a>
