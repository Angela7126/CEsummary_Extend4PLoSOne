<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As new runs are acquired, new records are added to the catalog and new records are added to the Match table (which is easily computed incrementally.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>One complication is that adding records may cause bundles to merge if the new record causes one bundle to overlap another.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Of the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge because the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If this is an inexpensive test and if there are less than a thousand runs, then one can compute the overlapping run pairs by simply comparing all runs to all others.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Most objects are slow-moving so their displacement between observations is small compared to the average inter-object difference.</a>
