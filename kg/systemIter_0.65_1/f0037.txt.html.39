<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So, shared disk systems have morphed to partitioned served-disk systems to improve locality.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, paradoxically, shared memory systems have been successful by adopting a shared-nothing software architecture.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, paradoxically, shared-memory and shared-disk systems are becoming shared-nothing systems as they aim for better data locality.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But, they have to have exactly the same data (or nearly so).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The next step is to have redundant servers and a load balancing system that can redistribute the load as servers fail.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In part this is due to Moore's law, in part it is due to our finally bringing the software base to a modular and partitionable architecture that maps well to shared-nothing arrays (and hence to shared memory and shared disk arrays).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Taking Microsoft as an example, the most spectacular MSN outages of late have been due to operations mistakes (misconfigured a router) and sabotage (denial of service attacks).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In retrospect this was due to a bus rather than switched memory interconnect, unsophisticated cache management, and ignorant software.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Clones, packs, load balancing, failover, and fallback all improve availability -- and they are all automatic.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Sites must be geo-plexed to achieve more than four 9s of availability -- that is the data is stored in two different geographic locations, and clients are routed to be fallback site if the primary site is down.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>But, due to some operations and sabotage problems, the end-user has seen more like Class-2 service.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So the first requirement for any system is that it has useful applications.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Ideally, each of the 64 processors executes in its own cache and on its own partition of the shared memory, only occasionally reading and writing memory shared with other processors.</a>
