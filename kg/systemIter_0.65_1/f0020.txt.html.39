<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A sentence involving an approximate concept may have a definite truth value even if the concept is illdefined.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This makes the concept of D flipflop itself approximate, perhaps not in the same sense as some other approximate theories.</a>
