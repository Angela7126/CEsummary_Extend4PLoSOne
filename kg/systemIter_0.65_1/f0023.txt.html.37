<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have maintained that the basic notion of free will is the same for humans, animals and robots.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If we wanted robots susceptible to schizophrenia, we would have to program in something like schizophrenia, and it would be a complicated and unmotivated undertaking -- unmotivated by anything but the goal of imitating human schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If so, they have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If asked to tell what it is doing, humans or some machine will tell about their choices for action and say that they intend to determine which action leads to the best consequence.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>He considers that freedom evolves in such a way as to make more and more events evitable, especially events that are bad for the organism.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Not guilty by reason of insanity" as applied to a person with schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>He compares determinism and inevitability, and makes definitions so that in a deterministic world, not all events that occur are inevitable.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>People and chess programs carry thinking about choice beyond the first level.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We can generalize SDFW by applying preferences to actions rather than to the situations resulting from actions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
