<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Through analyzing the minimum spanning graph, we can obtain the algorithm of updating based on deleting a semantic link.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>After checking all links' minimum spanning graph set, we can get a link set, links in this set have the same rank and links that are not in the set have a smaller rank.</a>
