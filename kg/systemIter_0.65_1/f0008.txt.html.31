<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>From the definition of the probabilistic resource space, we can specify the membership probability that a resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A resource space with the same structure can be created in the cyber space according to the mental resource space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Search the resources in the cyber space according to the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Classification is the most basic method for organizing various resources in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then, a Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P- RSM, is proposed in section 3 by mapping the RSM into the probabilistic space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Without knowing the relations between coordinates, and the relations between coordinate and axis, it is difficult to calculate the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point according to the membership probability that the resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So, the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point is a complex probabilistic event.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>According to the membership probability on each coordinate, the membership probability on each axis/point in a probabilistic resource space can be calculated by the following methods.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The resource space can automatically detect and upload resources by matching the pattern in resources and the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Xi -> [0, 1], i in [1, n]> consists of a resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) and a membership probability function u'\u0392' _{ri}, for any resource r and axis Xi in the resource space, u'\u0392' _{ri}(C) denotes the membership probability that r belongs to coordinate C under the condition that r belongs to the parent coordinate of C.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A probabilistic event in the Probabilistic Resource Space Model P-RSM is the probability that a resource belongs to a certain class.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn), if RS satisfies 1NF, then the membership probability interval that resource r belongs to point p is [max{0, ...</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a resource management model based on multi-dimensional classifications [35][36].</a>
