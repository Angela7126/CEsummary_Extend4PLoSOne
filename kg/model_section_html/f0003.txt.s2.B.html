<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME is a multi-dimensional complex space that generates and evolves diverse spaces to contain various types of individuals interacting with, reflecting, or influencing each other through various links within space or through spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>CP3SME has the following distinguished characteristics:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) Real-time multi-space situation aware.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Complex link.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Complex link is the composition of semantic link and interactive channels [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Complex health evaluation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Health should be detected and evaluated from multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) Multi-space coordination through times.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(5) Pervasive undetermined interaction.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(6) Multiple semantic layer reflection and lifetime preserving.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(7) Coordinating spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>CP3SME will coordinate triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating and zooming.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(8) Harmony.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>CP3SME concerns harmonious development of the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space rather than just the speed and capacity of computing and communication.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(9) Reflecting minds.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>CP3SME reflects minds by establishing and evolving cyber semantic images for various behaviors in multiple spaces</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(10) Time dimension.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Time dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This requires CP3SME to have an elastic time dimension and the models for the evolution of communities and individuals.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The following are some revolution aspects of the environment:</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Scientists will be able to access research objects and thoughts as well as their formation processes on demand through times.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>They can not only use languages to express ideas but also link the language representations to reasons in multiple spaces, to relevant research, and to applications.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Students can learn natural and socio laws not only from linguistic and mathematical description in textbooks but also from the linked physical, physiological, psychological and socio phenomena through times.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Learning materials and processes can be self-organized and adapted according to students' real-time interest and psychological statuses.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Function, structure, designer, owner, developer, and even ecological, physiological, psychological and socio effects will be accessible.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>All spaces will cooperatively reflect the formation processes of artifacts when they are required, designed, built, sold, used, and recycled.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be sensed and preserved as cyber semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Health of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be linked to measures.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The closed loop from production to consumption can be established to minimize the waste of material and energy with awareness of situations in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The CP3SME will help people know pollution sources and take appropriate control measures according to dynamic real-time micro-environment and recommendations.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>(9) Interactive virtual presence.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Energy supplies will link to requirements, road maps, patterns of traffic situation, parking spaces, and environment status.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Vehicles can be guided to appropriate destination according to intentions and minimization of energy consumption.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>The Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space so that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>The revolution of CP3SME will also bring new security issues.</a>
