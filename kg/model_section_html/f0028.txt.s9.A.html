<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Database systems usually do not support science's core data type: the N-dimensional array.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This collection is generally called the impedance mismatch, i.e, the mismatch between the programming model and the database capabilities, thus it is difficult to map many science applications into conventional tabular database systems.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, current databases are being integrated with programming languages so that they can support object-oriented databases.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This new generation of object relational database systems treats any data type as an encapsulated type that can be stored as a value in a field of a record.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This linking-embedding object model also nicely accommodates the integration of database systems and file systems -- files are treated as linked-objects.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We believe this database, file system, and programming language integration will be the key to managing and accessing peta-scale data management systems in the future.</a>
