<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A knowledge spirals consists of knowledge nodes (i.e, scientists) and two types of knowledge flow:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) External, knowledge flowing between nodes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) internal, knowledge arising within a node.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A knowledge flow spiral can generate and generalize knowledge during the processing and recycling of knowledge.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Recoding the evolution of knowledge flows among authors needs a semantic space of three dimensions: article, author, and time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Storing Knowledge requires a semantic space with three dimensions: knowledge level, area, and location.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>An effective knowledge flow network enables a research team to be very powerful in generating new knowledge.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Selecting the appropriate higher-energy nodes to cooperate is a strategy to increase the efficiency of knowledge flow networking.</a>
