<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It is necessary to use methods which consider the Turing machines's structure since the purely enumerate method is extremely ineffective.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>First, we revised the definition of the length of a computation performed by a Turing machine to discuss the efficiency of Turning machines.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For any universal Turing machine there is a standard way of recoding on it the computation performed by the given machine.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Let this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The rate of should be defined with respect to a machine whose tape is infinite dimensional, but this machine are not actually exist.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this paper, we only remark that dimensionality is meant to be lim_(n->inf)(log(V_n))/(log(n)) where Vn is the number of squares accessible to a given one in n steps.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The number of steps in a computation should be multiplied by this dimensionality to get the length of the computation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Let L(m,r,T) means the length of a computation of g(m,r) on Turing machine T. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If L(m,r,T1) â‰¤ L(m,r,T2) for all m and r for which these numbers are finite, we should certainly say that T1 is more efficient than T2.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, it is hard to give a function which gives an over-all estimate of the efficiency of a machine at computing g(m,r).</a>
