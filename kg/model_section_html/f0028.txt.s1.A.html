<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Scientific instruments and computer simulations are creating vast data with higher qualities that require new scientific methods to analyze and organize the data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Analyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies requires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We believe that most new science happens when the data is examined in new ways.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So our focus here is on data exploration, interactive data analysis, and integration of datasets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Data analysis tools have not kept pace with our ability to capture and store data, and scientists miss the simpler days when a notebook can store all the experiment data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We want to build the smart notebook that will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
