<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An interactive co-computing environment model incorporating machine computing, human reasoning and socio interaction is depicted in Fig. 17.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The co-computing process concerns the following behaviors:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Interaction requirements are raised in the physiological space, psychological space, socio space, and mental spaces from time to time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) The designer defines the function f of one computing machine, which can accept question from the user or from the other machine f' and then give answer, or ask f' or user questions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Minds reflect forms, emerge or enrich semantic images, generate motivation, and carry out reasoning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(4) Forms and semantic images co-evolve.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(5) The cyber space builds cyber semantic images during direct and indirect interactions so that it knows the past and present interactions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(6) Functions emerge from time to time with linking machines, services and humans as well as executing various flows such as information flow, knowledge flow, material flow, energy flow, and workflow in the environment [73][80].</a>
