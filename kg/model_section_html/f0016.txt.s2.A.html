<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We shall discuss various areas of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>MYCIN doesn't have such common sense knowledge, so its treatment sometimes really needs plan and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, most systems give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This doesn't cover the important case of concurrent events and actions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We need to invent a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>3) We need to handle the kind of partial knowledge people ordinarily have.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Partial knowledge means the ability to make predictions about the object's whole situation with its partial information.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>4) The ability to represent and use knowledge about knowledge is often required for intelligent behavior.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, an advanced MYCIN might need to reason that Dr. Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>5) A program that must co-operate or compete with people or other programs must be able to represent information about their knowledge, beliefs, goals, likes and dislikes, intentions and abilities.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>For example, scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Whether the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules is doubtful, since each rule match facts about specific objects.</a>
