<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We now return to the question of how to design machines which make use of information concerning the structure of Turing machines.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Let fk(x,y) be the function of two variables computed by the kth Turing machine, our procedure consists in trying the numbers fk(m,r) in order.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Next, revise the order in which recursive functions are considered.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One way is to consider f_(fk(L))(m,r) diagonalized on k and L.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is based on the plausible idea that, in searching for the solution to a problem, the given data should be taken into account.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then we choose some properties that are useful, and do not examined the objects which are not possessing these properties.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Here we remark that a property is useful mainly when it permits a new enumeration of the objects possessing it and not merely a test which can be applied.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is then necessary to be able to express all other relevant properties as functions of the new enumeration.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In order to avoid the limitation of formal system, we introduce the concept of formal theory.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For our purposes, a formal theory is a decidable predicate V(p,t1,...,tk->t) which is to be regarded as meaning that p is a proof that the statements t1,...,tk imply the statement t in the theory.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>An interpretation of a formal theory is a computable function i(t) mapping a class of statements of the theory into statements of other theories or concrete propositions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The only kind of concrete proposition which we shall mention for now is P(m,n,r,k) meaning fm(n) = r in a computation of length â‰¤ k.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>An action scheme is a computation rule which computes from a status function (its Godel number) a new status function, perhaps gives an estimate of g(m,r) if it has determined this, and computes a new action scheme.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thus the order of enumeration are determined.</a>
