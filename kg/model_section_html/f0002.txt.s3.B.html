<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Figure 1 depicts a knowledge spiral, comprising nodes and two types of flow:</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Internal knowledge flow u'\u2014' knowledge arising within a node as the result of processing.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A knowledge flow spiral can generate and generalize knowledge during the processing and recycling of knowledge.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Recoding the evolution of knowledge flows among authors needs a semantic space of three dimensions: article, author, and time as shown in Figure 1.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Storing Knowledge requires a semantic space with three dimensions: knowledge level, area, and location.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A high-energy knowledge node in science has many articles being cited by peers, that is, it emits more knowledge and contributes more to an area.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Maintaining knowledge energy differences between knowledge nodes and ensuring that only needed knowledge is passed between nodes are critical to realizing an effective knowledge flow spiral.</a>
