<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The speedup is due to better indexing and parallelism.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have also had considerable success in adding user defined functions and stored procedures to astronomy databases.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Using a database allows queries to define more sophisticated mesh partitions and allows concurrent indexed access to the simulation data for visualization and computational steering.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The database approach has the added benefit that visualization tools can watch and steer the computation by reading and writing the database.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Finally, while we have focused on the ability of databases to simplify and speedup the production of raw simulation data, we cannot understate its core competency: providing declarative data analysis interfaces.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is with these tools that scientists spend most of their time.</a>
