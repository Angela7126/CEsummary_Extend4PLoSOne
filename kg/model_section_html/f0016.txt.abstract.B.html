<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An expert system is a computer program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Nevertheless, hardly any of them have certain common sense knowledge and ability possessed by any non-feeble-minded human.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>By this is meant that they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don't recognize their own limitations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Common sense facts and methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One of the best known expert systems is MYCIN (Shortliffe 1976; Davis, Buchanan and Shortliffe 1977), a program for advising physicians on treating bacterial infections of the blood and meningitis.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It does reasonably well without common sense.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>MYCIN conducts a question and answer dialog.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>While the dialog is in English, MYCIN avoids having to understand freely written English by controlling the dialog.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Its major innovations over many previous expert systems were that it uses measures of uncertainty (not probabilities) for its diagnoses and the fact that it is prepared to explain its reasoning to the physician, so he can decide whether to accept it.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The ontology of a program is the set of entities that its variables range over.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It would therefore be difficult to modify MYCIN to learn from its experience.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>MYCIN's program, written in a general scheme called EMYCIN, is a socalled production system.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The whole process of questioning and recommending is built up out of productions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Some said it would be ok if there were a means of keeping MYCIN's database current with new discoveries in the field, i.e. with new tests, new theories, new diagnoses and new antibiotics.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Others say that MYCIN is not even close to usable except experimentally, because it doesn't know its own limitations.</a>
