<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Suppose someone says, 'The dog wants to go out'.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It also isn't shorthand for a specific prediction of what the dog is likely to do next.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Nor do we know enough about the physiology of dogs for it to be an abbreviation for some statement about the dog's nervous system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is useful because of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We can make similar statements about machines.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Here is an extract from the instructions that came with an electric blanket. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>"Place the control near the bed in a place that is neither hotter nor colder than the room itself.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft, it will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot."</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Nevertheless, the blanket manufacturer was probably right in thinking that it would help some users.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The example of the thermostat is a very simple one.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Here's a somewhat fanciful example of a machine that might someday be encountered in daily life with more substantial mental qualities.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The automatic teller is another example.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It has beliefs like, 'There's enough money in the account,' and 'I don't give out that much money'.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>These rules say nothing about the meaning of the characters, just how to compute with them.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This is analogous to a computer, which only obeys its programming language, but can be programmed such that one can communicate with it in a different programming language, or in English.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
