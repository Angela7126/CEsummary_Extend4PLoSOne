<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Structuring summary in an appropriate form is important as summary is mainly for human to read and understand.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There are some dimensions for organizing representations in a summary, such as time order, authors' organizing patterns and closeness to core representations</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For organizing a set of closely relevant representations, we should consider the formation process of the set.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For multi-document summarization, citations among documents should also be considered.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Further, we can consider organize representations with a multi-dimensional classification space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, a three dimensional space consisting of time, author and topic dimensions is practical.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Generalization and specialization threads through a topic tree.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A multi-dimensional space can be represented in different forms, for example, like wind-rose plot.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Each reader has his own personal space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A summarization can be satisfied only when it matches the personal space of the reader.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Therefore summarization system should summary on readers' demand in an interaction environment.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Besides, the form of displaying significantly influences the understandability of summary.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Interface innovation enables users to easily understand a summary.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We proposed some possible forms of interface.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Such as simple structures (list, tree, grid), hypertext, semantic link network, multimedia, pictures or videos emerging and new devices (3D monitor, 3D printer).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Whatever you choose, the form of interface should be able to convey the core meaning of representations.</a>
