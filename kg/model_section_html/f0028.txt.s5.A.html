<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Simple and convenient data models have evolved to represent arrays and relationships among them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are many parallel and competing efforts to build these tool suites in each discipline.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, this is problematic for data interchanging outside each group.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, definitions of common terminology (units and measurements) are emerging within each discipline.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These efforts will likely start to converge to form a format standard over the next decade.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This will greatly facilitate tool-building and tools.</a>
