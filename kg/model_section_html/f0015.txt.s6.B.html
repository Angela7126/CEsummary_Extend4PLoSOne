<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Daniel Dennett, Tufts University philosopher, has proposed three attitudes aimed at understanding a system with which one interacts.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The first he calls the physical stance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In this we look at the system in terms of its physical structure at various levels of organization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The second is called the design stance.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In this we analyze something in terms of the purpose for which it is designed.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The third is called the intentional stance, and this is what we'll often need for understanding computer programs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The intentional stance is most useful when it is the only way of expressing what we know about a system.</a>
