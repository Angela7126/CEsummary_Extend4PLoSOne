<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since then, scientists have been pursuing an ideal cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The typed link in the hypertext system is a link between documents or parts of document that includes information about the character of the link.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Semantic Net SN is a directed graph, where nodes are concepts, and edges are the relations between concepts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Concepts in SN are connected by the labeled links, while hyperlinks are more arbitrary.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>SN aims at symbol representation, reasoning and interpretation, while hypertext is for human to browse with ease.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The common point is that the construction of both relies on human (programmer and knowledge engineer respectively).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Various data structures like the linked list and tree can be regarded as a kind of link on data or data types for machine processing rather than for human to read [85].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The linked data is to connect Web data based on URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Much effort has been made on the Semantic Web since Berners-Lee initiated the vision [2].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The key idea is to make machine understandable semantics.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Generally, data mining is to find the implicit link in large closed data set by using statistical method [31].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Mining the structure in information network is a way to understand and make use of the network [10].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The initial motivation of SLN includes the following aspects:</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1) To support intelligent applications by assigning semantic indicators and rules to links and enabling relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(2) To explore the laws of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(3) To provide a light-weight semantic networking approach to peer-to-peer knowledge sharing [76][81].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>SLN has been developed toward a self-organized semantic networking model to manage decentralized resources.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The key is to establish and maintain the semantic links between peers according to their schemas, and to develop routing strategies that can make use of the links.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>SLN can have schemas to regulate its semantics by specifying node types, link types, and reasoning rules [88].</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>the self-organized SLN needs an adaptable schema that meets the need of changes because the clusters and links may need adapting when new instances are continuously generated.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The future interconnection environment was regarded as a large-scale human-machine environment that unites the nature, society and cyber space.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The environment will be an autonomous, living, sustainable, and intelligent system in which the society and physical space evolve cooperatively.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>It will gather and organize resources into semantic forms that both machines and people can use with ease.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>semantics needs to be studied in four worlds: real world, mental world, machine world, and document world rather than just in single machine world [82].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The cyber-physical-socio space is the fusion of the physical space, the cyber space, and the socio space.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Not only individual's behaviors but also socio interactions can be fed back into the cyber space for further processing.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Users can also change physical objects in the physical space, which can also be fed back into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situation.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>this paper explores the methodology of semantic linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence under the background of developing a complex space -- the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME.</a>
