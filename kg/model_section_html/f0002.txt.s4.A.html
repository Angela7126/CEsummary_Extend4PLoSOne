<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Scientists need an ideal e-science environment to support research, which can provide scientist with the following services:</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) Outline personal research roadmaps and depict the evolution of interest and knowledge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This service can display users' personal knowledge flow networks by finding their own and co-authors' citations, classifying the articles, expressing the category semantics, linking the categories with the citations, and revealing knowledge flows using the citation network.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Recommend a network of appropriate references.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This service can recommend references by ranking scientific articles according to their citation rates and the roles of the authors, and tracing and analyzing their citation networks to show the references as a network rather than as a list.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Display closely related peers and their status.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This service can help scientists select peers by finding the dense cliques in knowledge flow networks by looking at the statistical results and distribution of authors, articles, and citations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) Automatically discover interest groups.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Two types of citation relationship can be used, one is authors who cited the same article, the other is mutual citation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(5) Estimate the effectiveness of cooperative research.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(6) Objectively and dynamically evaluate researchers, institutions and disciplines.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(7) Estimate the development stage of a discipline and its maturity, thus help scientists plan research.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(8) Detect an emergent research area from the convergence of two areas.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(9) Interact with scientists.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Interactions include displaying cooperation between institutions and scientists, informing the statues of a group or a area, answering queries about the research situation, and planing personal or disciplines' development.</a>
