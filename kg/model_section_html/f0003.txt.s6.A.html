<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The basis of the development of the mental space is classification, link and interaction.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since classification, link and rule are the basis of recognizing, organizing and managing resources in various spaces, and interaction promotes evolution of all spaces.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The mental space can adapt its structure with continuously emerging semantic images and complex reasoning, where imagination plays an important role.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We listed 15 major operations of the mental space, which concerns the following aspects:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(1) Select the situations for reflection, and mapping them into semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(2) Adapting location of semantic images according to the change of the mental space's structure.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(3) Navigating flows, reasoning to find implicit links, zooming semantic lens, and linking, generalizing, specializing, analogizing or merging semantic nodes and links on SLNs, if we use SLN to model the mental space</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(4) Linking a semantic image to a language unit defined in the symbol space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(5) Composing operations into a macro process with some constraints to achieve a complex mental effect.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(6) Updating new semantic images and feeding back physical, psycological, physiological and socio effect.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>There is no definite one-to-one correspondence between an artifact and its semantic image.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Given the same input, the output of mind can be differentiate from the output of any artifact (machine).</a>
