<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When we interact with computers and other machines, we often use language ordinarily used for talking about people.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Much that we'll need to know concerns the information stored in computers, which is why we find ourselves using psychological words like 'knows', 'thinks', and 'wants' in referring to machines, even though machines are very different from humans and these words arose from the human need to talk about other humans.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As we interact more and more with computers -- both personal computers and others -- the questions of whether machines can think and what kind of thoughts they can have become ever more pertinent.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can ask whether machines remember, believe, know, intend, like or dislike, want, understand, promise, owe, have rights or duties, or deserve rewards or punishment.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Is this an all-or-nothing question, or can we say that some machines do some of these things and not others, or that they do them to some extent?</a>
