<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Machine, human and socio intelligence will be extended in CP3SME by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The following are four levels of pursuits of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Realizing semantic lens by integrating with the multi-dimensional classification space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(4) Exploring the general linking methodology.</a>
