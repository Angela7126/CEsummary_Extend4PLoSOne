<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Consider the problem of designing a machine to solve well-defined intellectual problems.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We call a problem well-defined if there is a test which can be applied to a proposed solution.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since any test may be regarded as being performed by a Turing machine, this means that welldefined intellectual problems may be regarded as those of inverting functions and partial functions defined by Turing machines.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper deals with the problem of designing a Turing machine which, when confronted by the number pair (m,r), computes as efficiently as possible a function g(m,r) such that fm(g(m,r)) = r.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Essentially, it substitutes integers in fm(n) until it comes to one such that fm(n) = r.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is not defined for a given value of n if the computation does not come to an end.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Hence the machine calculates the numbers fmk(n) in some order where fmk(n) is fm(n) if the computation of fm(n) ends after k steps and is otherwise undefined.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our problem does not end once we have found this procedure for computing g(m,r) because this procedure is extremely inefficient.</a>
