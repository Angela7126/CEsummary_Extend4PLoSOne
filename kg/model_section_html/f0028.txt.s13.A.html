<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The following are some hints of success:</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1) Focus on the ability of databases to simplify and speedup the production of raw simulation data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The speedup can be achieved by better indexing and parallelism.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>2) Try to add user defined functions and stored procedures to databases, and pay attention to manage petabyte stores of data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>3) Allow queries to define more sophisticated mesh partitions and allow concurrent indexed access to the simulation data for visualization and computational steering.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>4) Add visualization tools to watch and steer the computation by reading and writing the database.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>5) Focus on providing declarative data analysis interfaces, with which scientists spend most of their time.</a>
