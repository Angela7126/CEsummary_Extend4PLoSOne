<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But data volumes are doubling every year in most areas of modern science and the analysis is becoming more and more complex, exceeding the capacity of the paper notebook.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Today, most scientists have replaced or enhanced their notebooks with desktop computers that record their results, provide a portal to the scientific literature, and link them to collaborators via email.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As data volumes grow, it is increasingly arduous to extract knowledge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Scientists must labour to organize, sort and reduce the data, with each analysis step producing smaller data sets that eventually lead to the big picture.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In response to this data deluge, the systematic use of databases has become an integral part of the scientific process.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But there are few tools to properly visualize data across multiple scales and data sets.</a>
