<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Data independence means a clear separation of programs from data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Database systems provide physical and logical data independence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The goal of physical data independence is to change the underlying physical data organization without breaking any application programs that depend on the old data format.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By allowing such techniques, physical data independence allows performance improvements by reorganizing data for parallelism -- at little or no extra effort on the part of scientists.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Logical data independence insulates programs from changes to the logical database design, which is typically supported using views..</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Views can also be used to solve the evolution of data by dynamically translating data to the appropriate formats.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Database systems use a schema to implement both logical and physical data independence.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The schema for a database holds all metadata including table and view definitions as well as information on what indices exist and how tables are mapped to storage volumes (and nodes in a parallel database environment).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An explicit and standard data access layer with precise metadata and explicit data access is essential for data independence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Actually, the separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, ideas about data independence are still evolving.</a>
