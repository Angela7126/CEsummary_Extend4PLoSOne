<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned earlier, scientists often start with numeric data arrays from their instruments or simulations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Often, these arrays are accompanied by tabular data describing the experimental setup, simulation parameters, or environmental conditions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>the arrays undergo feature extraction to produce objects that are the basis for further analysis.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most scientific studies involve exploring and data mining these object-oriented tabular datasets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>the science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Set-oriented file processing will make file names increasingly irrelevant -- analysis will be applied to "all data with these attributes" rather than working on a list of file/directory names or name patterns.</a>
