<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Linking within and through spaces, emerging semantic images, and reasoning at different levels and facets are basic motions of the environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The following are four levels of pursuits of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms such as relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Realizing semantic lens by integrating with the multi-dimensional classification space [89].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(4) Exploring the general linking methodology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Machine intelligence, human intelligence, and socio intelligence are extended in the complex space by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.</a>
