<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic idea of text summarization is to distill the most important language representation units from a text to produce an abridged version for particular task and user.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>That is, automatic summarization systems need to consider three issues, which are selecting important language units, ordering the extracted units, and composing units into fluent texts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Previous automatic summarization methods can be classified by input, output, techniques, and evaluation criteria.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A multi-dimensional classification space which includes above classification dimensions can be used to summary all automatic summarization methods.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Many of previous methods have the following three characteristics that may not suitable.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) From text to text.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They cannot use words that are not important in current text, or beyond current text.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(2) Automation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Their summarization process excludes humans and cannot take enough human experiences and knowledge into consideration.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(3) Closed system.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Their process of automatic summarization does not interact with other processes in cyberspace or social space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Therefore, we need to consider many questions to form the methodology for developing summarization research.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The first is how to enable summarizers to summary a representation from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="14">[13]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It is necessary because humans lives in a multi-dimensional space, while a good summarizer enables people to quickly know the general and important information.</a>
