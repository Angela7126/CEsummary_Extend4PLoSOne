<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It helps understand what they will do, how our actions will affect them, how to compare them with ourselves and how to design them.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Second what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It's difficult to be rigorous about whether a machine really 'knows', 'thinks', etc., because we're hard put to define these things.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Beliefs and goals are ascribed in accordance with the the principle of rationality.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our object is to account for as much behavior as possible by saying the machine or person or animal does what it thinks will achieve its goals.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The language must be able to express the information our program can actually get about a person's or machine's 'state of mind'.</a>
