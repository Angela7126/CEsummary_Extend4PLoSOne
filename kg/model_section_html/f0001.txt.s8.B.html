<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is important in video management, retrieval and browsing.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are two fundamental classes of video summarization:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) focusing on still picture (static storyboard), a small collection of salient images extracted from video sources;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and, (2) focusing on moving pictures (moving storyboard), a collection of image sequences, and the corresponding audio abstract extracted from the original sequence, which results in a short video clip.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Summarizing a video requires machines to identify the essential characteristics of the video.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Video summarization concerns the simplification of motion.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The patterns of events, conversations, and behaviors should be characterized to get semantically meaningful summaries of complicated video contents [Tewfik, 1999].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Current online movies contain subtitles, which provide a new condition for making summarization of videos through natural language processing.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Graphs are the generalization of various real networks in cyberspace (e.g., data structures), physical space (e.g., supply chains, material flow networks) and social space (e.g., social networks of things).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Summarizing data structures can provide more general data services.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Automatic summarization of pictures can be extended to include the solutions to the following issues:</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) Generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(2) Selecting one picture to represent a set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(3) Generating a small network of pictures from a large set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(4) Generating a small network of texts according to a large set of pictures.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions: language, feature, time and location.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>A semantics-based approach to summarizing videos is to construct a semantic structure on videos by introducing semantic links into videos.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Discovering the semantic link networks that the pictures involved in can help automatic summarization.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The problem of summarizing texts, pictures, and videos can be generalized as one problem.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
