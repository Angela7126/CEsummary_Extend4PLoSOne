<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Main ideas of CP3SME are originated from many philosophical or scientific issues.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The exploration of socio relations and the harmony bases on Laozi' and Confucius' point of view.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The modeling method of the mental space and semantic image, i.e., integrating the multi-dimensional classification space and the semantic link network, are based on Thales', Plato's and Kant's idea.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The statistical approaches and the interactive semantics are based on Wittgenstein's view.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from Popper's static classification of universe, the evolving space model in CPESME emphasizes the dynamicity and diversity.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>CP3SME purses the uniformity, while respecting diversity, dynamicity, harmony and sustainability.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Although the development of modern science explains many phenomena, it is hard to created a uniform theory to explain all spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Philosophical problems of AI also have been discussed, and G?del's incompleteness theorem actually shows the limitation of machines.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Computer scientists borrowed concept "ontology" hoping to solve the semantics problem, and proposed many ontological mechanisms to establish consensus in specific areas.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, current methods to semantic and natural language understanding through processing symbols in cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Basing on rationalistic and empirical viewpoints on the formation of worldview and knowledge, CP3SME methodology argues that experience, reason and social construction contribute to the formation of mind from different facets and scales.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To sum up, main ideas of CP3SME include, forms expressed by individuals, semantic images mapped from forms, relations and mutual influences changed with interactions, structural construction and evolution inspired by continuous interacting, classifying and reasoning, in inter- and intra- multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Forms and semantic compose a dimension of CP3SME.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In traditional methods, features and structure are viewed as forms, and the mapping between forms and semantics are always fixed.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>However, one form may be used to indicate different semantics by different individuals, and different forms may be used to indicate the same semantics.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>So, CP3SME treats classification, link and rule as the basic forms.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A semantic link network of forms can help individuals emerge semantic images.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Forms in more spaces provide richer experience for indicating semantic images, thus semantic images emerge and evolve with continuous reflection and reasoning while co-experiencing in various spaces.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The following are some principles on form, semantics and interaction:</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(1) Operations on forms get forms.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>(2) Emerging semantic images through experience and reason.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>(3) Differences in emerging semantics.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>(4) Richness in emerging semantics.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>(5) Similarity in emerging semantic images.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(6) A little interaction goes a long way.</a>
