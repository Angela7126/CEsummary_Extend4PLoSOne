<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We cannot give definitions of mental qualities, because the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, we can give approximate criteria for some specific properties relating humans or animals to beliefs and goals.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Intends.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We say that a machine intends to do something if we can regard it as believing that it will attempt to do it.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tries.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is important in understanding machines that have a variety of ways of achieving a goal including possibly ways that we don't know about.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Likes. .</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As in 'A likes B', this involves A wanting B's welfare.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Self-consciousness.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Human self-consciousness involves at least the following:</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>1) Facts about the person's body as a physical object.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>2) The ability to observe one's own mental processes and to form beliefs and wants about them.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>3) Facts about oneself as a having beliefs, wants, etc. among other similar beings.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Some of the above attributes of human self-consciousness are easy to program, while others are very difficult.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Therefore, many present and future programs can best be described as partially self-conscious.</a>
