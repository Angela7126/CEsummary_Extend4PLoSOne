<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Scientists have been pursuing an ideal cyber space, and proposed many models of linked data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although various data structures like the linked list and tree have links on data or data types for machine processing, the linked data need to connect Web data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Connection ways include URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An example is the hypertext system, in which the typed link is a link between documents or parts of document with some character information.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Another example is Semantic Net SN, which is a directed graph where nodes are concepts and edges are the relations between concepts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Differences between SN and hypertext lie in (1) SN's edge are labeled links, while hyperlinks are more arbitrary;</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>and (2) SN aims at symbol representation, reasoning and interpretation, while hypertext is for human to browse with ease.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The common point is that the construction of both relies on human (programmer for hypertext and knowledge engineer for SN).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Semantic Web is also a structure of linked data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Its key idea is to make machine understandable semantics.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>First is to find the implicit link in large closed data set, and this process is generally called as data mining and mainly implemented by using statistical method [31].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However, links in hypertext system, SN, Semantic web and other models are either too simple to represent rich socio relations, or not able to reflect the semantics of real socio networks.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We proposed Semantic Link Networks SLN according to the following motivations:</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1) To support intelligent applications by assigning semantic indicators and rules to links and enabling relational, analogical, inductive and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(2) To explore the laws of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(3) To provide a light-weight semantic networking approach to peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>SLN has been developed toward a self-organized semantic networking model to manage decentralized resources.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The key is to establish and maintain the semantic links between peers according to their schemas, and to develop routing strategies that can make use of the links.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>SLN can also have schemas to regulate its semantics by specifying node types, link types, and reasoning rules [88].</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>An issue is how to automatically generate a schema from a set of SLN instances, which may concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Another issue is how to enable SLN adapt schemas in order to meet the need of changes because the clusters and links may need adapting when new instances are continuously generated.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The future interconnection environment was regarded as a large-scale human-machine environment that unites the nature, society and cyber space.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The environment will be an autonomous, living, sustainable, and intelligent system in which the society and physical space evolve cooperatively.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>It will gather and organize resources into semantic forms that both machines and people can use with ease.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>So, semantics needs to be studied in four worlds: real world, mental world, machine world, and document world rather than just in single machine world [82].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Fusing the semantic links and nodes among the physical space, the cyber space, and the socio space forms the cyber-physical-socio space.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>In where, (1) some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space;</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>(2) not only individual's behaviors but also socio interactions can be fed back into the cyber space for further processing;</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(3) users can also change physical objects in the physical space, which can also be fed back into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situation.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>However, can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>This paper explores the methodology of semantic linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence under the background of developing a complex space -- the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME.</a>
