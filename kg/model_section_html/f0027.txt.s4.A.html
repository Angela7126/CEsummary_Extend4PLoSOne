<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Not all experiments will experience exponential growth.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There are two trends in science today, scaling up and scaling out.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In scaling-up model, scientists are building billion-dollar facilities, which will not be easily leapfrogged.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>And once such facilities are switched on, they will produce roughly the same amount of data each year -- merely linear growth.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But in the scaling-out model, experiments that deploy an array of small instruments can exploit the coming explosion in cheaper commodity technology.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Considering these two trends, scientists in 2020 will continue to work in an exponential world.</a>
