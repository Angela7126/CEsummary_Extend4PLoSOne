<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Complex links will enable interactions to pass through spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The following are some important complex links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) MCM: Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Mental Space, which is the interaction between mental spaces through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) MCP: Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Physical Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the physical space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) MCS: Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Socio Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the socio space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(4) MAC: Mental Space <-- Artifact Space --> Cyber Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the cyber space through the artifact space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Varios complex links form a complex network, which has the following characteristics:</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) Diversity.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Complex link can transmit diverse resources such as material, information, knowledge, and energy.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It can link various individuals in diverse spaces to support creation and well-being.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) Real-time influence through spaces, for example, complex link networks in socio and mental spaces concern time.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(3) Cyber-physical-socio context and service.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The difference, competition, cooperation and continuous interaction among individuals lead to the formation of various network characteristics like the centrality, harmony and influence.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Harmony is based on healthy and satisfied interaction within a community.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The harmony of an individual is calculated by its physiological, psychological, socio and mental health.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The influence of individual A on B through complex link l can be measured by the potential energy of nodes A and B, the potential energy of link l, and the times of effective interactions between A and B.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The potential energy and the motion energy co-exist and influence each other through various networks in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>For example, an individual in society has potential energy due to its centrality in complex link network and interaction;</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>the potential energy of a community can be measured by its population, structure and interaction;</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Physical motion, socio behavior, and cyber operation has motion energy.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>For example, an operation's motion energy reflects the influence of the operation.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The node or path with higher potential or motion energy may have the priority to emerge.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>For example, the node with rich types of links takes the priority to emerge;</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The path with single type of links takes the higher emergency priority.</a>
