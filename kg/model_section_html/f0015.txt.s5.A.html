<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Suppose someone says, 'The dog wants to go out'.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did, and isn't shorthand for a specific prediction of what the dog is likely to do next.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It also isn't an abbreviation for the dog's nervous system.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This statement is useful because of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can also make similar statements about machines.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, here is an extract from the instructions that came with an electric blanket.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>"Place the control near the bed in a place that is neither hotter nor colder than the room itself.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft, it will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot."</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>I argue that the blanket manufacturer was probably right in thinking that it would help some users.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The thermostat is a very simple cases, because it only has three beliefs: room is hot, cold or ok.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A complex temperature control machine has more substantial mental qualities, since users may form more hypotheses about its beliefs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The automatic teller is another example.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It has basic beliefs like, 'There's enough money in the account,' and 'I don't give out that much money'.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A more elaborate automatic tellers has more beliefs to support more function.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Some one argues that a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things, since it just obeys its programming language.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>By analogy with giving a person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters, he will appropriately reply Chinese sentences with out knowing the meaning of the characters.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This person cannot be said to understand Chinese.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>However, I think we should make distinction between the hardware (the person or computers) and the software (the rules or programs).</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
