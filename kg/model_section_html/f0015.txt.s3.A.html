<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines helps understand what they will do, how our actions will affect them, how to compare them with ourselves and how to design them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Second what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Present machines have almost no emotional qualities, and I suppose not to give them any.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is not reasonable to use the kind of emotional anthropomorphism to machines, such as "this terminal hates me".</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus we need to make sure which kind of anthropomorphism we can need and when to use them.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>According to the principle of rationality, beliefs and goals are need to be ascribed to machines.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>There are two problem need to be considered:</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It's difficult to be rigorous about whether a machine really 'knows', 'thinks', etc., because we're hard put to define these things.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The language must be able to express the information our program can actually get about a person's or machine's 'state of mind'.</a>
