<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As computers become essential parts of scientific instruments, experiments became more and more electronic.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Experiment procedures already involve instruments and software with myriad parameters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is more difficult to capture all the model numbers, software revisions, parameter settings and process steps in an enduring format.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex, data become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And we believe that with current trends it is nearly impossible to reproduce experiments.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is important to recognize this problem, and to do what is possible to capture the workflows and to develop protocols for documenting instruments, procedures and measurements in ways that will be usable in several decades' time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Increasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Standards are essential at three levels, in formatting, in semantics and in workflows.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Standards for sharing data are crucial, especially for long-term researches such as soil ecosystems.</a>
