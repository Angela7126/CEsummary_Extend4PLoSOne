<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The logical system used in much artificial intelligent systems usually corresponds to a subset of first order logic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, deductive reasoning in mathematical logic has the monotonicity property.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Monotonicity property means that every sentence that was a deductive consequence of the original hypotheses is still a consequence of the enlarged set.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ordinary human reasoning does not share this monotonicity property.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, several artificial intelligence researchers have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Actually, Deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One such method is circumscription.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Circumscription describes the facts about a property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Circumscription allows us to express those objects can fly by adding a statement about it without removing existing statements in database, such as "bird can fly", "airplane can fly".</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>That is, we don't include negative statements in the database.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>However, there may exists exceptions for some general statement, such as "penguins cannot fly" and penguins are birds.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Circumscription allows us to make the known exceptions and to provide for additional exceptions to be added later -- again without changing existing statements.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Nonmonotonic reasoning can also be regard as a communication convention.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For example, if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
