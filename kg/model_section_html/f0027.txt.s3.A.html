<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Today, many scientists 'mine' available databases, looking for new patterns and discoveries, without performing experiments themselves.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, this data-rich approach to science faces challenges.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Large data archives are becoming increasingly 'isolated' in the network sense since the speed of internet cannot keep up with the growth of scientific dataset.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Distributed computation may be a solution, which typically mean sending computations to the data rather than copying the data to your workstation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But the management of distributed computations raises new questions of security, free access to public data and cost.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Are we reaching the limits of what one scientist, or one lab, can expect to achieve in data handling and analysis?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If so, this will have implications for how we review and publish our work.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For an example, if we want to reproduce the procedures of a data-ming paper in 20 years', we need to archiving both its data and its minging tools.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, although some disciplines have created their own data archives, there is no standard for publishing large volumes of data until now..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This increase the difficulty of the acquisition of large volume data.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Current databases still has much effect to do, such as encourage data sharing by rewarding, give public data creators and publishers credit, and enable archives to automatically provide provenance details.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Due to the sustained and rapid development of computers and scientific instruments, we will expect that this exponential growth in scientific data will continue for quite a long time.</a>
