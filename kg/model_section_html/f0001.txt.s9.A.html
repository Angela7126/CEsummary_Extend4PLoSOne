<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Summarization is a kind of operation that inputs one or more representations in a representation space and then outputs a new representation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The way human processing representations indicates human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts, pictures, videos and graphs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A unified representation should reflect the most fundamental characteristics of concerned representations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Establishing a unified representation enables a summarization system to uniformly process various representations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Transformation between representations is a way to realize unification, and summarization is a special transformation that operates dimension reduction for easier understanding.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>That is, the dimension of a summary should be same as the dimension of its reader's cognitive architecture.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The cognitive hierarchy of different communities corresponds to different sub-graphs of the hierarchy of universal concepts, i.e, cognitive levels.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A summary is suitable if its cognitive level is the same as the reader's cognitive level.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(1) If the original representation's cognitive level is the same as the reader's, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(2) If the representation's is higher, the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(3) If the representation's is lower, the summary should use more general concepts</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
