<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>SLN consists of two facets: form and semantics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic form of Semantic Link Network is SLN=<N, L, Rules>.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) N is a set of semantic nodes, they can be anything and usually explicit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) L is a set of semantic links, they indicate relations between semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic links are usually implicit and rely on semantic nodes' attributes and behaviors.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Add and Delete are two basic types of operations, they can be specialized into:</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>AddLink, DelLink, AddNode, DelNode, AddRule, and DelRule.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>SLN is an abstraction of various autonomous relational networks in different spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It can be specialized for dynamic or functional modeling by incorporating the class mechanisms of the object-oriented method, such as OOMD (Object-Oriented Modeling and Design), OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), and MA (multi-agent).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Semantic images emerge with reflection, linking and reasoning of co-experience in multiple spaces, and socio interactions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Mapping SLN into the semantic space concerns the mapping of semantic link, semantic node, community, SLN, and mapping an SLN into a semantic range (defined by the minimum semantic cover, and semantic closure).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>SLN has the following characteristics:</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) Openness, i.e, versatile semantic nodes, links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(2) Dynamicity, i.e, adding or removing nodes or links may have different influence on the whole network.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(3) Self-organization, i.e, there is no control on the construction of SLN.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(4) Autonomous reasoning, and reasoning can carry out locally because it is not necessary to derive out all relations to overload storage.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(5) Operation order sensitive, i.e, the result of operation may be different if orders of operations are different.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(6) Complex, i.e, a semantic node can be a semantic link network, and there are multiple reasoning mechanisms such as rational, analogical and inductive reasoning.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>(7) Semantic image.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>(8) Evolving community, i.e, operating an SLN has different effects at different stages of semantic communities' evolution.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The semantic lens enables SLN to be viewed from a particular semantic node to its semantic communities at different levels.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>SLN research concerns the following issues:</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>(1) How to efficiently answer the query on the relations between seemly irrelevant objects or events?</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>(2) How to recommend the best link to a node to realize its maximum performance according to such criteria as the rise of rank.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>(3) How to develop SLN toward a self-organized semantic model to support current network applications? How to support efficient relational query, especially, query on the evolving relations</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(4) How to predict the evolution of SLN? How do semantic links and semantic nodes influence each other during evolution?</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>(5) How to enable an SLN to support automatic question answering and explanation? How can a query be efficiently routed in a large self-organized semantic link network through explicit or implicit semantic link paths?</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>(6) How do different communities and reasoning processes influence each other over a large SLN?</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>(7) What level of intelligence can be reached by integrating multi-dimensional classification ability, linking ability and complex reasoning ability?</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>To sum up, SLN is a method for semantic linking, reasoning and analyzing, it is different from previous links and graph-based models in goal, model, method and research issues.</a>
