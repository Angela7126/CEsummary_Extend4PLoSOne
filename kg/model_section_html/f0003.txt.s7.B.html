<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>SLN consists of two facets: form and semantics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic form of Semantic Link Network is SLN=<N, L, Rules>.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) N is a set of semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Semantic nodes are usually explicit.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) L is a set of semantic links.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Semantic links are usually implicit and rely on semantic nodes' attributes and behaviors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Two basic types of operations are Add and Delete, which can be specialized into the following six basic operations:</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>AddLink, DelLink, AddNode, DelNode, AddRule, and DelRule.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>SLN is an abstraction of various autonomous relational networks in different spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It can be specialized for dynamic or functional modeling by incorporating the class mechanisms of the object-oriented method.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Fig. 8 depicts the way to enrich SLN for detailed function modeling by making use of OOMD, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), in the background of interactions between multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Semantic images emerge with reflection, linking, reasoning and socio interactions as depicted in Fig. 9.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Mapping SLN into the semantic space concerns the following mappings:</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(1) Semantic link mapping</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(2) Semantic node mapping</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(3) Community mapping</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(4) SLN mapping</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(5) Mapping an SLN into a semantic range</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>SLN is not just a labeled graph, it has the following characteristics:</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>(1) Openness.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>(2) Dynamicity.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>(3) Self-organization.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(4) Autonomous reasoning.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>(5) Operation order sensitive.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>(6) Complex.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>(7) Semantic image.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(8) Evolving community.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>SLN research concerns the following issues:</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>(1) How to efficiently answer the query on the relations between seemly irrelevant objects or events?</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>(2) How to recommend the best link to a node to realize its maximum performance according to such criteria as the rise of rank.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>(3) How to develop SLN toward a self-organized semantic model to support current network applications? How to support efficient relational query, especially, query on the evolving relations?</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>(4) How to predict the evolution of SLN? How do semantic links and semantic nodes influence each other during evolution?</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>(5) How to enable an SLN to support automatic question answering and explanation? How can a query be efficiently routed in a large self-organized semantic link network through explicit or implicit semantic link paths?</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>(6) How do different communities and reasoning processes influence each other over a large SLN?</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>(7) What level of intelligence can be reached by integrating multi-dimensional classification ability, linking ability and complex reasoning ability?</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>The above discussion shows that SLN is different from previous links and graph-based models in goal, model, method and research issues.</a>
