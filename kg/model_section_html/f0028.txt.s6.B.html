<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>data independence -- a clear separation of programs from data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Database systems provide two forms of data independence termed physical data independence and logical data independence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Physical data independence comes in many different forms.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, in all cases the goal is to be able to change the underlying physical data organization without breaking any application programs that depend on the old data format.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>By allowing such techniques, physical data independence allows performance improvements by reorganizing data for parallelism -- at little or no extra effort on the part of scientists.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Modern database systems also provide logical data independence that insulates programs from changes to the logical database design -- allowing designers to add or delete relationships and to add information to the database.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Logical data independence is typically supported using views.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, data evolves.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Views are used to solve these problems by dynamically translating data to the appropriate formats.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Database systems use a schema to implement both logical and physical data independence.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The schema for a database holds all metadata including table and view definitions as well as information on what indices exist and how tables are mapped to storage volumes (and nodes in a parallel database environment).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>an explicit and standard data access layer with precise metadata and explicit data access is essential for data independence.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>So, these ideas are still evolving.</a>
