<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME is a multi-dimensional complex space that generates and evolves diverse spaces to contain various types of individuals interacting with, reflecting, or influencing each other through various links within space or through spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>CP3SME has the following distinguished characteristics:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) Real-time multi-space situation aware.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, photos in personal Web pages will be real-time images in the multi-dimensional classification space including dimensions such as time, location, event, audio, and video.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Complex link, which is the composition of semantic link and interactive channel.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Complex health evaluation, i.e, health should be detected and evaluated from multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(4) Multi-space coordination through times.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(5) CP3SME executes with pervasive undetermined interactions between individuals within and cross spaces.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(6) CP3SME will reflect individuals, communities, interactions and events at multiple semantic layers, and its preserving will be real-time and lifetime.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(7) CP3SME will coordinate triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating and zooming.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(8) CP3SME concerns harmonious development of the cyber, physical, physiological, psychological, socio and mental space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(9) CP3SME reflects minds by establishing and evolving cyber semantic images for various behaviors in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(10) Time dimension in the CP3SME can be compressed and stretched , and such compression and stretch can be viewed as accelerating or detailing the evolution of the CP3SME environment.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The CP3SME environment brings revolution on following aspects:</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) Science.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Scientists can access research objects, thoughts and formation processes of thoughts on demand through times.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(2) Education.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Students can learn natural and socio laws not only from linguistic and mathematical description in textbooks but also from the linked physical, physiological, psychological and socio phenomena through times.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(3) Engineering.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Function, structure, designer, owner, developer, and even ecological, physiological, psychological and socio effects will be accessible.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>(4) History and culture.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be sensed and preserved as cyber semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>(5) Society and life.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(6) Intercultural collaboration.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>(7) Green society.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The CP3SME will be efficient and low carbon as it will ensure optimal coordination between knowledge flow, information flow, material flow, energy flow, and value flow through spaces.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(8) Human-centered environment.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The dynamic human-centered micro-environment will be known by linking sensors to mobile phones and vehicles, collecting real-time information, and classifying information according to the location, distribution of population and pollution sources.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>(9) Interactive virtual presence, i.e, people can interact with someone who are not present.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>(10) Energy and traffic, i.e, the CP3SME environment will optimize energy supplies and avoid traffic jam.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>(11) Ecology.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>In CP3SME, ecology problems in the physical space will be reflected through complex links, and evolution of cyber and socio space will positively influence physical ecology.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>CP3SME environment will also bring new security challenges, since previous security issues focused on one space.</a>
