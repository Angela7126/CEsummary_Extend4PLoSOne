<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Citation is a kind of representation of selection and language use.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is also a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, it is necessary to understand citation when studying summarization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Citation can be classified into explicit citation and implicit citation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Explicit citations can be easily found in scientific papers and books.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These citations form citation networks which renders the source, the information and evolution of research areas.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Summaries of different scales can be obtained through zoom-in-and-zoom-out on a citation network.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Explicit citations also exist among webpages, i.e, hyperlink.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Implicit citation often used in fre texts and literature works.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Some implicit citation have mark words such as "someone says", while others just reuse other's sentences or clauses without any mark words.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Summarizing various citations can reach a notion of general citation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Furthermore, a representation's intention and extension can also be defined by citations.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The extension of representation A consists of all representations that cite A and are cited by A.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The core representation renders the core idea of a representation, which has a high rank in the citation network.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The intention of representation is indicated by core representations and by citation from other representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Therefore, a representation can be composed by a set of representations.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For example, if we view entries in a dictionary as basic implicit citations to words, then any text has a set of basic citations.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>So if we regard citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization, the summarization S of a set of representations P is rendered by its intention Int(P) and extension Ext(B).</a>
