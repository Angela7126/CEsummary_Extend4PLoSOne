<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An expert system is a computer program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although current expert systems generally perform well in their specialized domains, few of them have certain common sense knowledge and ability.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don't recognize their own limitations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Take the best known expert system MYCIN for example, it is a program for advising physicians on treating bacterial infections of the blood and meningitis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It has some limitations, which are caused by absence of common sense:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>1. Although MYCIN conducts question and answer dialogs in English, it avoids understanding freely written English by controlling the dialog, i.e, users types only single words or standard phrases.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>2. The ontology of a program means the set of entities that its variables range over.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments, while doctors, hospitals, illness, death or even patients are not part of the ontology.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Thus MYCIN can never compare the infections of two different patients for modifying itself to learn from its experience.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>3. MYCIN's program is a production system, and the whole process of questioning and recommending is built up out of productions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, the rules in its production system are fixed by designer, so it cannot keep current with new discoveries in the field, i.e. with new tests, new theories, new diagnoses and new antibiotics.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>4. MYCIN doesn't know its own limitations, i.e, it have no common sense to judge whether its advices are suitable.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For example, it may give a two weeks of treatment to a patient who will soon die. </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For these limitations, MYCIN is not usable except experimentally.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Therefore, we need to incorporate common sense into MYCIN to make it useful.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, common sense facts and methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>besides, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.</a>
