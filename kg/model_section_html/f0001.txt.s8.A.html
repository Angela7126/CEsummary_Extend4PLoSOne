<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is important in video management, retrieval and browsing.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are two types of video summarization:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) focusing on still picture to extract a collection of images;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and (2) focusing on moving pictures and corresponding audio to extract a short clip.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Summarizing a video requires machines to identify the essential characteristics of the video.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These characteristics include the simplification of motion, the patterns of events, conversations and behaviors, the low-level features such as color and boundary, and the characteristics of important sections in some particular applications.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Current online movies contain subtitles, which provide a new condition for making summarization of videos through natural language processing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Graphs are the generalization of various real networks in cyberspace (e.g., data structures), physical space (e.g., supply chains) and social space (e.g., social networks).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Summarizing data structures can provide more general data services.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For pictures summarization, the main purpose is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Automatic summarization of pictures can be extended to the following issues:</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1) Generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(2) Selecting one picture to represent a set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(3) Generating a small network of pictures from a large set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(4) Generating a small network of texts according to a large set of pictures.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The summarization of pictures can be extended to a four dimensional space -- language, feature, time and location, since model cameras provide time and location information.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as summarizing a semantic link network.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Constructing a semantic structure on videos or pictures by introducing semantic links will also facilitate videos or pictures summarization.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Thus the problem of summarizing texts, pictures, and videos can be generalized as one.</a>
<a name="21">[20]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
