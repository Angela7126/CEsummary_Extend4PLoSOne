<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The physical space, since created, has been evolving with composition and decomposition as well as cooperation and competition through various physical, chemical, biological and socio interactions of multiple scales.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Such interactions pushed the generation following spaces, </a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) mental space, to reflect various forms in the physical and socio space as semantic images of different scales, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to evolve the semantic images.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) physiological space, to hold the functions of living individuals.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) psychological space, to hold the perception, cognition, attention, emotion, motivation, behavior, and some underlying physiological and neurological processes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(4) artifact space, as the effect of the mental space development and interactions between the mental space, psychological space, physiological space, and physical space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(5) socio space, to contain socio individuals, communities, relations, values, and rules.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(6) symbol space, to help indicate semantics according to rules of languages, and to instruct machines to behave intelligently.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(7) cyber space, to reflect more of the other spaces and facilitate socio interaction, computation, and information services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic link network is a kind of abstraction that can be used to model these spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For an example, if symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For another example, if information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>These spaces influence one another, for example, a significant event in the physical space may generate or influence an event in the socio space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>They will co-evolve, reflect one another, and interact with each other as a complex space, i.e., the CP3SME environment.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The interactions between these spaces facilitate evolution of CP3SME, and the evolution of CP3SME will generated more spaces in the future.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The process of classification indicates the semantics of the form, and continuous classification is the basic movement that generates and evolves these spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Competition and cooperation as well as unification and separation will accompany the evolution of the environment.</a>
