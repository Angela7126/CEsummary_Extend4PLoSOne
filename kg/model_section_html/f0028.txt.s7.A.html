<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As mentioned earlier, scientists often start with numeric data arrays from their instruments or simulations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Often, these arrays are accompanied by tabular data describing the experimental setup, simulation parameters, or environmental conditions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These arrays eventually undergo feature extraction to produce tabular objects.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most scientific studies involve exploring and data mining these object-oriented tabular datasets.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, traditional procedural tools always search for relevant files and then open each file to extract all relevant data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So they runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, set-oriented file processing will perform analysis to "all data with these attributes" rather than working on a list of file/directory names.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The database community has provided automatic query processing along with CPU and IO parallelism for over two decades. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We believe that many of those techniques apply to scientific datasets .</a>
