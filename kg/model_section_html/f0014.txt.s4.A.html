<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Following are several remarks of this paper.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1. A status function would consist primarily of estimates of the validity of the separate theories and would place theories which had not been examined in an "unknown" category.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>2. A formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, knowledge can be interpreted as a predisposition to act in certain ways under given conditions, and an action scheme can be interpreted as a belief that certain action is appropriate under these conditions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>3. We have imposed our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine, facilitating we offering general procedures (i.e., will eventually solve every solvable problem).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>4. Except for the concrete proposition none of the statements of a formal theory have necessary interpretations which are stateable in advance.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>5. The relation of certain action schemes to certain theories might warrant our regarding certain statements in them as being normative.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>6. If there exist more or less satisfactory answers with no way of deciding whether an answer already obtained can be improved on a reasonable time, the problem is not well-defined.</a>
