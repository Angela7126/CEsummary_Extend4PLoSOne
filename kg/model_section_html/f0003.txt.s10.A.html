<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The closed loops of complex link within CP3SME concern macro and micro closed loops.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Macro closed loops aim at improving the performance of behaviors for majority individuals in the whole environment, while micro closed loops are focused on improving single individuals behaviors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Fig.14 depicts a cyber-physical-socio-ecological environment, where the material, information and control flows within space and between spaces form macro closed loops within the environment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This environment has some characteristics:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(2) Multi-dimensional real-time status about individuals and communities in the physical space and the socio space can be captured.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(3) The cyber-physical-socio effects of various behaviors are available so that appropriate decisions can be made to ensure harmonious development of various spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) The mental space will develop new functions as it will emerge and evolve new semantic images when reflecting multiple spaces simultaneously.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Such influences through spaces can also form macro closed loops.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As for micro closed loops, humans can not only sense from multiple channels but also form micro close loops through sensing, behaving, emerging semantic images, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Practice helps establish the links between the behaviors through different channels and between behaviors and semantic images.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Optimizing the micro closed loops will raise the efficiency of cognition.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The main issue lies in figuring out how do sense, behavior, language and reasoning interact with and influence each other.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>CP3SME also provides a new innovation environment.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The macro and micro closed loop of flows through the spaces form a sustainable innovation environment.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Fig.16 shows a example of innovation and design environment in CP3SM, where thoughts are inspired by the requirements and co-experiences in multiple spaces.</a>
