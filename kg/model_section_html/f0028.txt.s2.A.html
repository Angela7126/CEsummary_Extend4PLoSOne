<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The demand for tools and computational resources to perform scientific data-analysis is rising even faster than data volumes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is a consequence of three trends: algorithmic intensity, nonlinearity, and bandwidth-limits.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To ameliorate these problems, scientists will need better analysis algorithms that can handle extremely large datasets with approximate algorithms and they will need parallel algorithms that can apply many processors and many disks to the problem to meet cpu-density and bandwidth-density demands.</a>
