<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Human language use and understanding has some basic characteristics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These characteristics lead to following principles of language use:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) Separation principle, i.e, grammar and semantics, knowledge and representation, representation and its summaries are separated.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Separation principles lead to the natural obstacle of summarization.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Social selection principle, that is, the suitable summarizer for a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Knowledge Selection princile, that is, the person sharing the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, authors who commonly cited a representation are suitable summarizers, and authors are the best persons to summarize their own representations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) Relativity principle, (5) moderate principle and (6) dynamicity principle are about the satisfactory of summaries.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These three principles show that the satisfied degree of a representation's summary varies with its readers and time.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(7) Openness principle say that a satisfied summary cannot be reached in a closed system, therefore establishing static criteria for evaluating is unnecessary.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Above basic characteristics and principles indicate some summarization strategies.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(1) Using summaries composed by people who have rich social relations with original authors.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(2) Adapting to readers' interests.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(3) Making summarization through human-machine interaction.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(4) Enabling different summaries to cooperate and compete with each other for impact at multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(5) Transforming summarization process into the problem of searching suitable persons or summaries in social networks of authors, readers, summarizers, representations and links.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(6) Integrating background of representations into summarizers.</a>
