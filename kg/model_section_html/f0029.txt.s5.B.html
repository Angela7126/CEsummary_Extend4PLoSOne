<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Having the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...) about the object's position, magnitude, classification, the number and types of misses that the object experienced, and other attributes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This suggests creating a Bundle table that records these statistics.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Each Match record has a bundleID field added to it to point to its corresponding Bundle record.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>When bundles overlap it may make sense to merge them into one bundle with one Bundle record.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>adding records may cause bundles to merge if the new record causes one bundle to overlap another.</a>
