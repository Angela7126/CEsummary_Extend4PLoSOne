<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Science centers that curate and serve science data are emerging around next-generation science instruments. </a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There is a convergence of the nascent-databases (HDF, NetCDF, FITS, ...) which focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Three technical advances will be crucial to scientific analysis:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(1) extensive metadata and metadata standards;</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(2) great analysis tools;</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>and (3) set-oriented data parallelism access supported by new indexing schemes and new algorithms.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Science centers will provide both the archives and the institutional infrastructure to develop these peta-scale archives and the algorithms and tools to analyze them.</a>
