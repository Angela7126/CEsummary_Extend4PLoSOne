<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The SDSS catalog is cross-matched with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B as part of the pipeline processing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Most objects are slow-moving so their displacement between observations is small compared to the average inter-object difference.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The SDSS is observed in five spectral bands -- each band's observation occurs about a minute after the previous band.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Those five measurements allow cross-matching observations of objects with apparent motions of 0.01 to 10 arcminutes per minute (or a comparable number of degrees per day).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When considering SDSS observations separated by days or years, only very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In general, a naive spatial match does not work for fastmoving objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Rather one must model the object's motion, and then predict where that object will be in the observational field.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Unfortunately, model uncertainties accumulate with time -- especially for fast moving nearearth objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Expressed in relational terms this is a full-outer spatial join among the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The full-outer part of that expression means that there may be zero, one, or many items that match for each bundle.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>We call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match) because this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Building pivoted cross-matches is surprisingly difficult.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Given the bundle and match tables, the pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs</a>
