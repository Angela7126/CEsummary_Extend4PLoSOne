<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Procedures already involve instruments and software with myriad parameters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is difficult to capture all the model numbers, software revisions, parameter settings and process steps in an enduring format.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex, data become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But we believe that with current trends it is nearly impossible to reproduce experiments.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is important to recognize it as such, and to do what is possible to capture the workflows and to develop protocols for documenting instruments, procedures and measurements in ways that will be usable in several decades' time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Increasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Standards are essential at several levels: in formatting; in semantics; and in workflows.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Standards for sharing data are crucial.</a>
