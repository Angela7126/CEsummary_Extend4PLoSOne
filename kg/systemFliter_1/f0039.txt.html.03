<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the mean time, there is a tendency to put many processors on a shared memory (Shared Memory Processors or SMP).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If you have watched the evolution of computing, it is easy to believe that there have been exponential improvements in hardware and linear improvements in software.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the data is not there, the processor has to go to the level 2 cache (a few megabytes) that are typically 10 clocks away.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the local area, gigabit Ethernet is about to become ubiquitous and inexpensive.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In that time, a modern processor can execute 4 instructions in parallel, if all the data is available (a quad issue processor).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These are laudable efforts, and MPI is the workhorse of Beowulf clusters.</a>
