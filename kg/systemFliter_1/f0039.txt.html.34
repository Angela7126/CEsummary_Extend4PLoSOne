<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we can put a Graphical query interface on the front of this, and a good data visualization system on the output, we should be able to allow astronomers to do data analysis without having to write programs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In order for the archives to cooperate and in order for astronomers to compare data from multiple archives, the data in each archive needs to have a clear description of what it means.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A single disk can deliver about 30 MBps of data if the disk is read sequentially.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore is increasingly important that large computations lay the data out on disk in a sequential order, and scan it sequentially if possible.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Among other things it means that if you can afford to store the data for one time period (a year) then storing it forever only doubles the hardware cost.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Perhaps this will change in the future, but if you live in the present, you want to put the computation "close" to the data to minimize costs -- rather than moving huge datasets to the computation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Moore's law applies more generally to microprocessor clock speeds (they have been doubling every 18 months for a long time), disk capacity (doubling every 12 months since 1990), and network bandwidth (doubling every 8 months according to George Gilder (and others) [Gilder].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If an astronomer is interested in a particular part of the dataset, she can copy that part to a local parallel server (costing 1k$/terabyte of disk including the processors to manage and search that terabyte).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So astronomy seems to be tracking Moore's law, doubling data volumes every two years as more and better CCDs are put behind the glass and as new instruments come online.</a>
