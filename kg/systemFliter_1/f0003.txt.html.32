<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Research concerns origin and essence of material, energy, information, knowledge, service, life, mind and society in the environment, harmonious and sustainable development of the environment, and the methodology for studying, developing and maintaining the environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In 1945, Vannevar Bush introduced the ideal of memex, which could browse and make notes in an extensive on-line text and graphical system, and contain a very large library, personal notes, photographs and sketches, and several screens and a facility for establishing a labeled link between any two points in the entire library [8].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, Minsky regarded minds as the collections of vast number of semi-autonomous, intricately connected agents, and gave an explanation of how minds relate to such functions as motivation, language, memory, learning, intentions, and metaphors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The environment will ensure healthy and meaningful life of individuals, and maintain a reasonable expansion of population of various individuals and the scopes of behaviors according to the overall capacity and the material, energy, information, knowledge and service flow cycles.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It provides a computational path from sensing and motor action to words and speech acts by combing concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the CP3SME, co-experiencing in multiple spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of various links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning are the basis of the cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans create the artifact space by designing the functions of artifacts, assigning semantic indicators to artifacts to reflect meaning or idea, and linking one another by direct or indirect referencing (e.g., paintings of the same author or times).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The associate mechanism polynemes invoke partial states of agents for representing some different aspects of a thing's meaning, e.g., recognizing an apple arouses its properties and relevant experience.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The massively collaborative online repositories such as Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org/) and ODP (Open Directory Project, www.dmoz.org/) can be used to build the hierarchy based on the analysis of how people define and evolve the classes.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Human beings rely on innate fundamental concepts or categories in minds such as space and time to organize and interpret sense experience.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
