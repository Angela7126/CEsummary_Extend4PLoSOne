<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given these observations, it seems obvious that the Visualization and Analysis computer scientists can help improve existing systems, but that the logical progression is for the systems people to build a "rationalized base" and then for the Algorithms and Visualization people to build new tools atop that base.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The code to schedule and "drill" the fiber plate to take spectra was huge and poorly understood -- so the astronomers could not change it easily to address this custom problem.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The result is that the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, Space Telescope Institute, Cornell, Caltech, and NOAO have each been able to leverage this software base.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, we automated the loading process with a workflow system built atop SQLserver and its Data Transformation Service (DTS.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This requires the objectification of the discipline -- defining an object model that encapsulates facts and represents them in standard ways.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Foreign keys, by having integrity constraints and by doing integrity checks in the data loading process have uncovered a myriad of problems which have fed back into the pipeline.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We use object spectra as a "training set" to estimate even more galaxy distances based on photometry alone -- the so called photometric redshifts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As the community evolves, and as some scientists master these skills, they communicate successful patterns to their colleagues -- that is how scientific techniques evolve.</a>
