<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Here we describe a plan to develop an Internet data resource in astronomy to help address this problem in which, because of the nature of the data and analyses required of them, the data remain widely distributed rather than gathered in one or a few databases (e.g., GenBank).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We assume the Internet will evolve so that copying larger data sets will be feasible and economic (in contrast, today data sets in the terabyte range are typically moved by parcel post).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the programs evolve, the computer science challenge is to automate these tasks of configuring and tracking replicas and of tracking data lineage and dependencies on different derived data versions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Data may also be wholly or partially replicated at other sites so to speed local computations, because it is often faster and cheaper to access local data than to fetch it from a remote site.</a>
