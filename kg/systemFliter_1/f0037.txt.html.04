<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Now most modern database systems offer database replication -- and the feature is widely used to geoplex data and to provide fallback service.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is a class of single-node ScaleUp systems from HP, IBM, and Sun, running DB2, Oracle, and Sybase that process about 300 million tpcC transactions per day on a computer costing about ten million dollars with a 20 TB database.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Things are going so well that the company decides to (1) do a leveraged buyout of a much larger company and asks you to integrate your site with theirs, (2) form a consortium with two other companies to provide some new services, (3) internationalize the operation offering services in the 20 major languages and 50 major currencies and 500 tax codes, and (4) embrace the latest technology fad, which today is UDDI, WSDL, schemas, XLANG, SOAP, and XML.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These giant systems can handle the backend of all but the top 25 websites -- and for those a ScaleOut of a ten or 100 of these systems would be adequate.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Dell and Compaq for example both have low-end systems running Windows 2000 and SQL Server 2000 that cost about 100k$, have about 1TB of disk and can process about a million transactions per day.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, shared disk systems have morphed to partitioned served-disk systems to improve locality.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The tpcC results show this fairly clearly, when you subtract out the disks from the equation (disk prices are nearly constant across all vendors) the residue systems vary in cost by a factor of ten or more.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Operations tasks have to be automated and eliminated -- and systems should just be self-protecting and self-healing, both at the hardware level (IBM's recent announcements) and at the software level (we all have just begun ...</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Today, we are at 600,000 tpmC (about a billion tpcC transactions per day), and the cost per transaction is hovering in the range of 5 microdollars -- the hardware and software cost of the system equates to about five dollars per million transactions.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The chairman of IBM is calling for the return of the mainframe, asserting it is cheaper to run 1,000 Linux systems on a mainframe than it is to run 1,000 Intel boxes -- mostly because the management costs dominate.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>So, paradoxically, shared-memory and shared-disk systems are becoming shared-nothing systems as they aim for better data locality.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Some impressive systems run by tiny staffs, but the norm is that operations and management consumes huge budgets.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Today, several vendors are shipping systems that scale to 32 or 64 processors, with either a uniform memory access (UMA) or non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>And then there is a class of multi-node ScaleOut clusters from IBM and Compaq running Windows2000 and SQL Server producing about a billion tpcC transactions per day on a 42 TB database.</a>
