<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is also incapable of expressing the counts of the numbers of squares with a given property, the latter being required for expressing the Minsky, Winograd and Stefanuk proofs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Writing the propositional calculus formulas asserting that a domino projects in exactly one direction from each square, that there is a domino project back from a square into which a domino projects and that no domino projects off the board or into a forbidden square is taken as straightforward, i.e.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Taking into account the jog one gets an answer as to the parity of the number of vertical dominoes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Axioms 13 and 14 insure that the dominoes don't overlap, axioms 6-12 insure that all squares but the corner squares are covered and axiom 15 insures that no dominoes stick out over the edge.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We get a proof if there are not enough dominoes projecting from the n - 1 squares to the n-squares.</a>
