<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Friedberg approach was successful in learning only how to move a single bit from one memory cell to another, and its scheme of rewarding instructions involved in successful runs by reducing their probability of modification was shown by Herbert Simon (a now substantiated rumor froma 1987 personal communication) to be inferior to testing each program thoroughly and completely scrapping any program that wasn't perfect.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In my opinion, GPS was unsuccessful as a general problem solver, because problems don't take this form in general and because most of the knowledge about the common sense needed for problem solving and achieving goals is not simply representable in the form of rules for transforming expressions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, a Prolog program incorporating this fragment directly can sterilize a container only by killing each bacterium individually and would require that some other part of the program successively generate the names of the bacteria.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Prolog represents a local optimum in this continuum, because Horn clauses are medium expressive but can be interpreted directly by a logical problem solver.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This resembles the usual logical natural deduction systems, but for reasons beyond the scope of this lecture, it is probably not correct to regard contexts as equivalent to sets of assumptions -- not even infinite sets of assumptions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While Friedberg's problem was learning from experience, all schemes for representing knowledge by program suffer from similar difficulties when the object is to combine disparate knowledge or to make programs that modify knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some contexts are very specific, so that Watson is a doctor in the context of Sherlock Holmes stories and a baritone psychologist in a tragic opera about the history of psychology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It seemed then and still seems that humans communicate mainly in declarative sentences rather than in programming languages for good objective reasons that will apply whether the communicator is a human, a creature from Alpha Centauri or a computer program.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Newell's current candidate for general problem representation is SOAR (Laird, Newell and Rosenbloom 1987), which, as I understand it, is concerned with transforming one state to another, where the states need not be represented by expressions.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This treats the qualification problem, because any number of conditions that may be imagined as preventing moving or painting can be added later and asserted to imply the corresponding ab aspect ...</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, MYCIN (Buchanan and Shortliffe 1974) has many rules about how to infer which bacterium is causing an illness based on symptoms and the result of laboratory tests.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>One kind of generality in AI comprises methods for finding solutions that are independent of the problem domain.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The common sense information possessed by humans would be written as logical sentences and included in the database.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Conversely, if we axiomatize at a fairly high level of generality, the axioms are often longer than is convenient in special situations.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>I might be discouraged from continuing to pursue it if people pursuing nonlogical approaches were having significant success in achieving generality.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The critic may propose to haggle about the precise meaning of "on" inventing difficulties about what can be between the book and the table or about how much gravity there has to be in a spacecraft in order to use the word "on" and whether centrifugal force counts.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The result of a production system pattern match is a substitution of constants for variables in the pattern part of the rule.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>However, if we imagine that additional features of situations and additional actions may be added to the database, we face the problem that the axiomatization of an action is never completed.</a>
