<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Moreover, just as in the map coloring problem, postponing some variables may remove enough goals involving other variables so that they in turn become postponable.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Alain Colmerauer (1981) wrote such a program for rewriting the Pereira-Porto coloring program.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From the point of view of logic programming, successively reducing the map by postponing countries with three or fewer neighbors is an example of a more general notion -- that of a postponable variable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the programmer can arbitrarily rewrite the program, he may change the logic as well as the control.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>No matter how the rest of the map is colored, there is always a color available for such a country.1 We use this in to improve a Pereira-Porto map coloring program by "reducing the map" by removing such countries and doing our trial-and-error coloring on the reduced map, confident that once the reduced map is colored, the coloring can be extended to the omitted countries.</a>
