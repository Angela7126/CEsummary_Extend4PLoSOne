<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Suppose a robot uses T1 as a theory of the blocks world and takes actions accordingly, but the real world corresponds to T2.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the simpler theory T1, there is a list of names of mountains paired with lists of climbing expeditions or names of climbers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This makes the concept of D flipflop itself approximate, perhaps not in the same sense as some other approximate theories.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is important that the meanings of On(Block1,Block2) used in solving the problem theoretically and that used by the robot correspond well enough so that carrying out a plan physically has the desired effect.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>These need not be the negations of each other, so it can happen that it isn't justified to say either that x is on y or that it isn't.</a>
