<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>* On random workloads, disk mirroring is preferable to RAID5 parity because it spends disk space (which is plentiful) to save disk accesses (which are precious).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In case of a proxy, assume a fast connection between the user and the cache (e.g., a 100Mb/s LAN), so that the time cost of accessing data from a remote proxy disk is not significantly larger than that from a local disk.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If a disk costs $1200 and does 120 accesses per second, then a disk access per second costs $10.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Storage prices have dropped so low that the storage management costs now exceed storage hardware costs (similarly, PC management costs exceed the cost of the hardware).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since disk and RAM have a 1:100 price ratio, this price decline suggests that what is economical to put on disk today will be economical to put in RAM in about 10 years.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As processor speeds continue to outpace memory speeds, there will be increasing incentives for software designers to look for algorithms with small instruction cache footprints, with predictable branching behavior, and with good or predictable data locality (i.e., clustered or sequential access).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>At that time a GB of disk cost about a million dollars, and so it made sense to have someone optimizing it and monitoring the use of disk space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In theory, the current 550 MHz Intel processors are able to execute 2 billion instructions per second, so Amdahl's IO law suggests that each 550 MHz processor needs 160 MBps of disk bandwidth (all numbers rounded).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This should be balanced against the cost of the disk to store the pages -- but as mentioned earlier, $12 will buy a LOT of disk space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>By using RAID (mirroring or parity), administrators sacrifice disk storage capacity to protect against disk media failures.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>RAID5 uses up to four disk accesses to do a write, and improves read bandwidth only if the data requests go to different disks.</a>
