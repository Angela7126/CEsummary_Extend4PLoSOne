<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The work was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research New World Vistas program and by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency High Performance Knowledge Bases program.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The most recent proofs, by separate computer programs written by Mark Stickel ((Uribe and Stickel 1994)) and Dan Pehoushek (personal communication) apply propositional satisfaction algorithms to a propositional expression in 256 variables.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In a future article, we hope to put the Winograd and Stefanuk proofs in a logical form that isolates the creative part from the routine part.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The impossibility statement is readily formulated as a sentence of the predicate calculus, but I don't see how the parity and counting argument can be translated into a guide to the method of semantic tableaus, into a resolution argument, or into a standard proof.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Creativity was not mentioned in that 1964 memo, but I evidently mentioned it in lectures, because the problem gave rise to an informal competition aimed at finding the most non-creative solution to the problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In fact, the Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk proofs are all creative, and we will try to identify the creativity involved and give a concise expression of the ideas.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(McCarthy 1964) presented the problem as a tough nut for first order theorem provers, because a straightforward formalization of the problem provides no way of making the argument in the language of the formalization.</a>
