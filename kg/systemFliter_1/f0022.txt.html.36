<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, formalized in first order logic, because its power allows formulas that are closer to expressing the human ideas behind the proofs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Odd + odd is even so the total is even, but the total is 31.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Taking into account the jog one gets an answer as to the parity of the number of vertical dominoes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is also incapable of expressing the counts of the numbers of squares with a given property, the latter being required for expressing the Minsky, Winograd and Stefanuk proofs.</a>
