<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For a semantic link network with m resources and n semantic links, under the assumption of equal distribution, there are d = n/m(m u'\u2212' 1) links between two resources on average.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>According to Theorems 2 and 3, the decomposition is loss-less.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>According to Theorem 1, the decomposition is a loss-less one.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Meanwhile, the size of rule set rs is a constant.</a>
