<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Simple structures such as list, tree and grid have been widely used to summarize representations in daily life, e.g., displaying table of contents, family trees, organization structures, and properties on map.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Applications include Web portals such as Yahoo, YouTube, posters, slides, medical certificate, TV guides, advertisements and conference programs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some summaries are mainly in form of text such as the abstracts of scientific papers, the prefaces of books, the tables of contents, CVs, the headlines of news, webpages with hyperlinks, book reviews, Wikipedia, and the results of Web search.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In macroscopic, it is important to represent the background of the video and relevant social structure, interests, fashion, rules, regulations, laws and culture of society in a summarization system.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Different from static text, the citation network dynamically renders the source, the formation and evolution of the area, the backbone, the impact of researchers and institutions, potential knowledge flows through citation links [Zhuge, 2006], and the networks of cooperation between researchers and between institutions with the evolution of the area.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>feature representation, pattern representation, language representation (including text, voice, and movie), and function representation (different objects such as car, mobile phone, house and road have different functions)</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Observing and rethinking the basic characteristics of human language use can inspire research on summarization as language use including listening, speaking, reading, writing, understanding, and thinking.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Objects can be located in a space of multiple dimensions such as time, topic, and publication type (book, journal, or conference) for efficient retrieval and management.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Knowledge representation approaches such as the production rule [Davis, et al, 1977], the frame [Minsky, 1975] and the semantic net [Quillian, 1966] are symbol systems that can carry out reasoning for solving problems.</a>
