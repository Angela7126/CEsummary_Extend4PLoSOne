<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>u'\u2022' Opportunity, which concerns competition (new entrants and products), risks (accident, nature disasters, economic or political crisis), responsibility (social responsibilities for providing safe goods), and environment (controlling pollution) and stakeholders.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>u'\u2022' Sustainable development, which concerns strategies for improving behaviours to gain higher values or lowering the cost and more positive environmental benefits, e.g., raising bargaining power and enhancing competition power and carrying on green transformation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the enterprise is at the introduction stage, data about relevant products (including components), potential competitors, customers, suppliers, market, and constraints like environmental protection should be selected to support product innovation, design and development.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Citing (including commenting) is a kind of interaction that could attract potential citations because (1) new citations could incur explicit citation links between papers, implicit comment links between papers and researchers, explicit cooperation links, and implicit knowledge flows between researchers, which form small worlds of research;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A software called Globus was developed to build an adaptive wide area resource environment, and integrated higher-level services that enable applications to adapt to heterogeneous and dynamically changing meta-computing environments.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The main purpose of analyzing human behavior is to find, understand and estimate various requirements so as to effectively operate the observed system (e.g., organize resources for production) to provide on-demand products or services.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The linked data is a method of enabling data on the Web from different sources to be connected and queried based on Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF, www.w3.org/RDF/), Web Ontology Language (OWL, www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and SPARQL query language for RDF (www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Figure 4 shows an example of data analysis for enterprise strategic planning, which concerns organization, product, production, marketing, customer relations, and investment strategies.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is the cognitive systems that discover knowledge through interacting with the physical space, representing information, building concepts, proposing and verifying assumptions in the representation space, and externalizing knowledge with a certain form of representation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Social networks help build global cooperation that enables people in different regions to share knowledge with each other, accelerate the evolution and differentiation of communities, and record the interaction between people and behaviors.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Knowing the implicit semantic links and relevant rules, computing systems can help human to recognize more implicit links by discovering rules, managing and predicting semantic links, and supporting analysis (Zhuge, 2012).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) Obtain the category hierarchy by analyzing the open Web contents such as Wikipedia and ODP (Open Directory Project) and existing ontologies, which indicate popular categories.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>u'\u2022' Efficiency and impact, which concern resource efficiency (save resources and money), social impact (creating jobs and donation), and environmental impact (green development model).</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A big idea in computing history is to transform the thinking computing model u'\u23af' u'\uf8e7' Turing machine into an implementation model by viewing program as data and enabling programs to be fetched and stored in the same way as data (Neumann, 1958).</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>It transformed the paradigm of computing and the business model of computing by making infrastructure, platform, software, and communication as services and shaping a new way to developing and marketing hardware and software.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Extending Bush's Memex insight (Bush, 1945), Gray proposed the personal Memex, which can record everything a person sees and hears, and quickly retrieve any item on demand.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Enabling users to compose their individual interfaces is a solution but this requests rich, standard components, and user-friendly languages for composition and correctness guarantee.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The information modeling system transforms data (e.g., texts) into information with computable information models (e.g., proposition network, cognitive map, probability models and generative models) and measures (e.g., measuring information quantity in text) through reading, or transforms information into text(s) according to information models (e.g., generative model).</a>
