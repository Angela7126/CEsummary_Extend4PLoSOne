<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Invisible knowledge flow networks self-organize and evolve continuously and interact with each other through flows to form an autonomous knowledge space for providing advanced knowledge services.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The system can display users' personal knowledge flow networks by finding their citations and their co-authors' citations, classifying the articles involved by discipline and chronology, expressing the category semantics for advanced services, linking the categories with the citations, and revealing knowledge flows using the citation network.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Effectively managing knowledge flows within a team can lead to effective team knowledge management and eventually raise the effectiveness of teamwork.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Coordinating and fusing knowledge flows, data flows, and control flows, and integrating knowledge flows and workflows, are powerful means for making teamwork effective.</a>
