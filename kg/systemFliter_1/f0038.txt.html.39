<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since served data must travel over the PCI twice (once from the disk to memory and then from memory to network, brick input and output are limited to about 40 MBps in serving data to clients.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, CD sneaker net runs at about 70kbps, costs about 1600 CDs for a terabyte (== 250$ media cost), and takes about a week to write, ship, and read the terabyte.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So we can write a 1 terabyte array in about 4 hours, ship the 7 disks overnight for about 50$, and then read them in 4 hours.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We began sending raw disks to one another, but that has the nasty problem that disks do not plug right into the network.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Still, for fidelity to the argument, we can read and write disks at about 25MBps (average) and they can be written in parallel at about 25MBps (see table 5).</a>
