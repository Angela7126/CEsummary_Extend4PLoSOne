<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The SLN of texts enables individuals to read and write in natural languages through semantic lens so that a piece of text can be viewed from different facets, abstraction levels, scales and versions.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The key issue is how to automatically link diverse types of resources and coordinate semantic link networks according to diverse individuals' interests that may change from time to time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from the creationist point of view, Charles Darwin's theory on the origin of species argues that populations evolve over generations through a process of natural selection.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Teachers read the papers and books to rebuild the semantic image about the law, and then externalize it by writing textbooks, which enrich the explanation and indication of the law.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The structure and semiotic dynamics of collaborative tagging implies some underlying consensus on organizing and sharing resources [8,21].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The time dimension records the time of interaction, event occurrence, and adding a semantic link to the semantic link network so that the semantic lens can show semantic image through time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Current e-presence techniques can capture the videos, photos, audios, texts and their synchronization relations of human presence and replay them according to the synchronization relations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It enables the semantic lens to sense and make use of sounds based on the mappings between sound, event, scene and object.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Analogy may carry out to locate a network of objects by comparing past internalization experience in similar situation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from the centrality principle in general network, linking a new node or adding a new semantic link to a semantic link network could generate new semantic links due to relational reasoning on semantic links.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Knowing the relation between the richness of single media, the richness of channels, and indicators helps build and rebuild semantic images [14,38].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the future cyber-society, social requirements will be mainly ful u'\ufb01' lled by searching, interacting, possibly adapting, and then composing services during interaction.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The semantic link network (SLN) and the classi u'\ufb01' cation space can be integrated by mapping the nodes or communities in the semantic link network into the points or subspaces of the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It is the basis of the whole civilization of human beings, but it cannot be accurately and completely represented as it concerns uncertain and undecidable social interaction, motivation, and evolution.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, AI concerns human intelligence, knowledge, and intelligent machines.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Scientists read the paper and then wrote their papers and books based on Newton's work, therefore waving a citation network.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>6 shows a process of rebuilding the semantic image of the Newton law of motion through inventing, learning, teaching and learning the law.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Some art languages are based on several basic elements and operations such as shot, sequence and scene in u'\ufb01' lm language.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>With constant interaction, a classi u'\ufb01' cation space will contain more dimensions and coordinates, and points will contain more object items, therefore an individual can rebuild richer semantic image when reading a set of indicators.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Based on the mappings, complementing or integrating existing models can obtain new capacity of semantic modeling [49].</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The rapid development of various arti u'\ufb01' cial networks like the Web provides experiment data for studying complex networks.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The interaction interface is responsible for supporting friendly interaction operations and recording the interaction process.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Further, when an individual reads the text, the words will be associated with the experiences in the points of the multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space, therefore, a semantic image (a semantic link network of experience) emerges.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Showing one type of SLN, relevant SLNs will emerge according to coordination rules and relations (may be implicit) regardless of their types.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Zooming may be navigated between different types of SLNs or between points in a classi u'\ufb01' cation space by changing the focus according to interest.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>A real world object and its indicator will be internalized as an item (instance) in a point of the space S as shown in Fig.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Individuals build their own semantic images based on semantic worldview while leaving tracks in the semantic image of the system.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>This does not hinder individuals from effective interaction as there is no evidence to show that human behaviors rely on accurate representation.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>For example, semantic images corresponding to the words in text continuously emerge during reading, and words are selected according to the semantic images emerged during writing.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Four semantic worlds (real world, mental world, machine world and document world) were classi u'\ufb01' ed for understanding semantics [49].</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>As social semantics, interactive semantics emphasizes on the evolution of semantic images rather than accurate representation.</a>
