<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The number of dominoes projecting from the top row to the second row is odd.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A student said something like, "An odd number of dominoes project down from the top row and an odd number down from the second row to the third ...</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Note that an odd number of dominoes project from the top row to the second and continue from there.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Starting with the top row, compute the parity of the number of dominoes projecting down out of each row.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Successively compute the parity of the number of vertical dominoes projecting from each row to the next.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
