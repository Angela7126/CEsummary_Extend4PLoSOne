<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The MIPS, Alpha, PowerPC, Sparc and (someday) Itanium processors all support 64-bit addressing, as does IRIX, VMS, HPUX, Solaris, and AIX, but Linux, SCO, Windows, Netware, MacOS, and MVS do not yet have a 64bit memory option.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Computing involves progress in many areas, data visualization, human-computer interfaces (vision, speech, robotics), mobile applications (wireless and batteries), micro-electron-mechanical-systems (MEMS), and the more prosaic areas of networking, processing, and data storage and access.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>More generally, scripting languages like JavaScript, VBscript combined with powerful libraries seem to offer huge productivity gains over traditional approaches.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The basic problem has been that tcp/ip and the sockets interface were designed for a wide area network with long latencies, high error rates, and low bandwidth.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There is now a crash program underway to overhaul our software to be 64-bit friendly (the Microsoft Windows2000 and Linux solutions are undergoing beta test today -- but that is just the first layer of the software stack).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>My simple advice is to stick with low degrees of SMP and work hard on program locality so that you have streamed access to the memory.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Don Slutz and I have been working with Alex Szalay to apply these techniques to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If an astronomer is interested in a particular part of the dataset, she can copy that part to a local parallel server (costing 1k$/terabyte of disk including the processors to manage and search that terabyte).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These are "hero" benchmarks that employ very high-speed links (2.5 Gbps), expensive switches (Juniper) costing hundreds of thousands of dollars each, and of gurus (who are priceless).</a>
