<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Observing and rethinking the basic characteristics of human language use can inspire research on summarization as language use including listening, speaking, reading, writing, understanding, and thinking.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Knowledge representation approaches such as the production rule [Davis, et al, 1977], the frame [Minsky, 1975] and the semantic net [Quillian, 1966] are symbol systems that can carry out reasoning for solving problems.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures with the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years due to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary, and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The faceted navigation approach is not traditional text summarization, but it is a special summarization because it can extract different facets in large text(s) to enable users to read only the interested facet [Xu and Zhuge, 2012].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The basic behaviors of summarization include emerging, selecting, citing (explicitly or implicitly), and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The function 'Classifying & Linking' classifies representations according to the given dimensions, connects representations by discovering implicit relations, transforming implicit relations into explicit relations, discovering communities, and identifying appropriate representations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Citation is an individual selection of relevant representations for explaining, evidencing, complementing, commenting, or revising a representation, either explicitly or implicitly, according to individual motivation and knowledge.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The strategy is to make use of sensors and create semantic links between pictures and texts by detecting common projections at physical and social dimensions.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Humans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements, but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday.</a>
