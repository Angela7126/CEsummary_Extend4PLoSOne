<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As new runs are acquired, new records are added to the catalog and new records are added to the Match table (which is easily computed incrementally.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Indeed, the SDSS catalog pre-computes the spatial join as the Neighbors table using the Zones algorithm described in [2].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Two objects are said to match if they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match) because this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>When comparing runs from different instruments the ephemeral issues may be even more dramatic -- the object may not be visible in the second instrument because it does not radiate in that spectral band, or the two instruments may have very different sensitivity.</a>
