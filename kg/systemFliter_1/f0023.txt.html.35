<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Thinking about one's free will requires theoretical structure beyond or above SDFW.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We can generalize SDFW by applying preferences to actions rather than to the situations resulting from actions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have maintained that the basic notion of free will is the same for humans, animals and robots.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>SDFW is therefore a partial theory that requires extension when we need to account for these phenomena.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So far as I can see, no animals consider the consequences of alternative actions;</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) includes the non-deterministic of Result used to compute which action leads to the better situation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>If so, they have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Just as with equation (1), we can say that person chooses an action that leads to more freedom at the next situation.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>So will considering actions as praiseworthy or blameworthy.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>People and chess programs carry thinking about choice beyond the first level.</a>
