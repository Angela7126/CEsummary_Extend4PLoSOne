<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Creativity was not mentioned in that 1964 memo, but I evidently mentioned it in lectures, because the problem gave rise to an informal competition aimed at finding the most non-creative solution to the problem.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(McCarthy 1964) presented the problem as a tough nut for first order theorem provers, because a straightforward formalization of the problem provides no way of making the argument in the language of the formalization.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We use Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, formalized in first order logic, because its power allows formulas that are closer to expressing the human ideas behind the proofs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Someone might argue that the decision to use set theory is creative, but I'm striving for a technical notion of creative solution, and one has to start with some background language.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Writing the propositional calculus formulas asserting that a domino projects in exactly one direction from each square, that there is a domino project back from a square into which a domino projects and that no domino projects off the board or into a forbidden square is taken as straightforward, i.e.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If one starts at the top and computes the successive parities, there is a jog in parity when an excluded square is encountered.</a>
