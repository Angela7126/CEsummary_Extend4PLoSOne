<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>RDF Schema (RDFS, www.w3.org/TR/2004/ REC-rdf-schema-20040210) defines a set of syntaxes to store the metadata of resources with XML syntax and provides basic RDF vocabularies for structuring RDF resources.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is easy to verify that all closures of the single semantic link types construct a classification for the semantic link types of the SLN schema, and we can decompose an SLN schema based on such a classification.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Updating an SLN schema concerns resource types, semantic link types, and reasoning rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In fact, we can deal with such a redundancy by decomposing the schemas into advanced forms and building reference relations between schemas.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) is based on the combination of OWL with RuleML [4].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As a form of knowledge representation, a traditional semantic network is a directed graph of concepts and semantic relations between concepts [12].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Denote the deleted resource type set as RD, the semantic link types set as LD, and the deleted rules set rsD.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) Compute the classification of the semantic link types in S according to the definition of the closure of semantic relative and the rule set rs denoted as {L1, L2,..., Lk}.</a>
