<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>My answer is based on work in the field of artificial intelligence (usually abbreviated AI) which is the science and engineering of making computers solve problems and behave in ways generally considered to be intelligent.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A more elaborate automatic teller that handles loans, loan payments, traveler's checks, and so forth, may have beliefs like, 'The payment wasn't made on time,' or, 'This person is a good credit risk.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>I suppose some philosophers, psychologists, and English teachers would maintain that the blanket manufacturer is guilty of anthropomorphism and some will claim that great harm can come from thus ascribing to machines qualities which only humans can have.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Perhaps Honeywell discovers that these compromises should be modified according to a social rank formula devised by its psychologists and determined by patterns of speech loudness.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Much that we'll need to know concerns the information stored in computers, which is why we find ourselves using psychological words like 'knows', 'thinks', and 'wants' in referring to machines, even though machines are very different from humans and these words arose from the human need to talk about other humans.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
