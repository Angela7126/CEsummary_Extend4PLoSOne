<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Odd + odd is even so the total is even, but the total is 31.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Taking into account the jog one gets an answer as to the parity of the number of vertical dominoes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We get a proof if there are not enough dominoes projecting from the n - 1 squares to the n-squares.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Axioms 13 and 14 insure that the dominoes don't overlap, axioms 6-12 insure that all squares but the corner squares are covered and axiom 15 insures that no dominoes stick out over the edge.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If one starts at the top and computes the successive parities, there is a jog in parity when an excluded square is encountered.</a>
