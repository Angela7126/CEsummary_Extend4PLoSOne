<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The cognitive modeling system outputs concepts, relations and rules to the knowledge space modeling system for verification and organization.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Establishing a multi-dimensional space to hold big data generated by the observed complex system is a basic approach to data management and analysis.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Tracing the origin of big data research and linking big data to behavior, knowledge and cyber-infrastructure is a way to explore big data methodology.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Figure 5 depicts the mapping from the data generated by the observed system in the physical space into the virtual knowledge space through the representation space and a group of cognitive systems that evolve with the interaction with the physical space and the external representation space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The observed system, data and knowledge evolve during observation, discovery and knowledge processes.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Managing knowledge for effective data analysis is the key to generating great knowledge from analyzing data.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A cognitive system has a personal knowledge space and an internal representation space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Big data may mislead analysis if data are not hold by the dimensions of the observed complex system.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The big data of the observed system and the big data of previous research actually indicate scientific problems that need to be explored.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Data analysts can discover knowledge only when they have knowledge about the observed system that generates data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A knowledge system consists of structure, operations, rules and reasoning mechanisms.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Big data analysis involves in a dual complex system consisting of an observed system (e.g., a factory) and a human system.</a>
