<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Pereira and Porto (1980) give a logic program for coloring planar maps with four colors and discuss how "selective backtracking" can reduce the search involved in coloring a map from that done by a straightforward PROLOG execution of the same program.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The discussion by Pereira and Porto treats coloring maps purely as an example of logic programming, and the improvements they discuss apply to all logic program systems.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>They point out that when an attempt to satisfy a literal fails, because the two adjacent regions mentioned have been assigned the same color, standard PROLOG will take back the most recent assignment of a color even if the region most recently colored was neither of those involved in the incompatibility.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>From the point of view of logic programming, successively reducing the map by postponing countries with three or fewer neighbors is an example of a more general notion -- that of a postponable variable.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the graph is described by giving for each country a list of its neighbors, the imbedding information can be including by listing the neighbors in cyclic order -- clockwise or counterclockwise.</a>
