<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Suppose that whenever a sentence p is present in the memory of a computer, we consider it as in a particular context and as an abbreviation for the sentence holds(p,C) where C is the name of a context.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, consider the definition that a container is sterile if it is sealed against entry by bacteria, and all the bacteria in it are dead.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Futhermore, it should be noticed that the situation calculus applies only when it is reasonable to reason about discrete events, each of which results in a new total situation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This problem of how general to be arises whether the general common sense knowledge is expressed in logic, in program or in some other formalism.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The basic formalism of the situation calculus is s' = result(e,s), which asserts that s0 is the situation that results when event e occurs in situation s.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This led in the 1960s to the situation calculus (McCarthy and Hayes 1969) which was intended to provide a way of expressing the consequences of actions independent of the problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Unless the relevant triple is abnormal in aspect3, the action of moving an object to a location l results in its being at l.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Implicit in (McCarthy 1959) was the idea of a general purpose common sense database.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, the rules about birds flying implicitly assume that there is an atmosphere to fly in.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Whenever we write an axiom, a critic can say that the axiom is true only in a certain context.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Production systems represent knowledge in the form of facts and rules, and there is almost always a sharp syntactic distinction between the two.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We say that a container is sterile if it is sealed and all the bacteria in it are dead.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This led to STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson 1971) which reduced the use of logic to reasoning within a situation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It seemed to me in 1958 that small modifications in behavior are most often representable as small modifications in beliefs about the world, and this requires a system that represents beliefs explicitly.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Whenever we tentatively decide on some axioms, we are able to think of situations in which they don't apply and a generalization is called for.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Some contexts are very specific, so that Watson is a doctor in the context of Sherlock Holmes stories and a baritone psychologist in a tragic opera about the history of psychology.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>More specifically, an object does not change its location unless the triple consisting of the object, the event that occurs, and the situation in which it occurs are abnormal in apect1.</a>
