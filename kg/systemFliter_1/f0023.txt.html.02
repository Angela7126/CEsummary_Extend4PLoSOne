<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This article benefited from discussions with Johan van Benthem, Daniel Dennett, Gary Drescher, and Jon Perry.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Burning one's bridges, nailing the flag to the mast, and promising to love until death do us part are examples of actions that reduce choices.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Likewise, Ken Thompson has built chess programs for end games with five or fewer pieces on the board that use table lookup rather than look-ahead.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Blaming or praising humans requires taking human peculiarities, not shared with agents in general, e.g.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Artificial intelligence requires expressing this phenomenon formally, and we'll do it here in the mathematical logical language of situation calculus.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When a person, animal, or machine reacts directly to a situation rather than comparing the consequences of alternative actions, free will is not involved.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The work was partly supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If a training set of (say) 32 combinations permits the ape to do the remaining 32 without further trial and error, it would be reasonable to conclude that the ape can predict the effects of the successive bounces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Much human action and almost all animal action reacts directly to the present situation and does not involve anticipating the consequences of alternative actions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>At a higher level of abstraction, it is regarded as a disease in which certain kinds of thoughts enter and dominate consciousness.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Using free will is too slow in many situations, and training and practice often have the purpose of replacing comparison of consequences by automatic reaction to a situation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A patient's belief that the CIA has planted a radio in his brain is relieved by medicines that change blood chemistry.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Richmond Thomason in [Tho03] compares situation calculus to theories of action in the philosophical literature.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>One of the effects of practicing an action is to remove deliberate choice from the computation and to respond immediately to the stimulus.</a>
