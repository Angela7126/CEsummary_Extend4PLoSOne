<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Previous semantic net, semantic web, hyperlink, and semantic link are too static to represent dynamic relations in nature, minds, and society.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The initial motivation of the semantic link network SLN was to extend the hyperlink networks by enriching links and inclusion of rules and rule reasoning [2, 3, 6, 20 u'\u2013' 23].</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Through analyzing the minimum spanning graph, we can obtain the algorithm of updating based on deleting a semantic link.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Carrying out reasoning and analysis on CPSocio-SLN according to the operations on the minimum semantic cover, maintaining the closure of CPSocio-SLN, and recording the place that needs to be modi u'\ufb01' ed in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>RDF (www.w3.org/RDF) describes the universal resources and their relationships based on the triple (object, attribute, value).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This strategy leads to high ef u'\ufb01' ciency in maintenance, but the cost of query is high.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Different from previous studies on various types of links, a distinguished characteristic of CPSocio-SLN is that it keeps evolving from the beginning due to its reasoning ability.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Based on Characteristic 4, adding a new link may change the other links' minimum spanning graph sets.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If there are two semantic links sharing a common node and satisfying a reasoning rule, then a relational reasoning can be conducted, e.g.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The third ef u'\ufb01' cient storage strategy is to save both the semantic closure and the minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN so that we can operate on the minimum semantic cover and can query on the closure.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(4) Maintenance for adding or deleting a rule AddRules The maintenance operation of adding or deleting a rule is to update the CPSocio-SLN according to new rule set by using step 3 in maintenance of the AddNode operation.</a>
