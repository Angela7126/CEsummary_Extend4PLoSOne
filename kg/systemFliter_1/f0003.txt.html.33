<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from other individuals, humans can actively link symbols to the physical space, and to the socio space through the physiological space, psychological space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The logistic processes will leave semantic images in the environment and can be adapted according to the change of requirements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Complex link can be chained and closed for improving the performance of behaviors in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(1) Selecting the situation for reflection according to the active points in the mental space reflecting the physical, physiological, psychological, and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Reasoning leads to the dependence between semantic links and the dependence between operations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(9) Emerging a semantic image according to a given network in the physical space or socio space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>As the effect of learning and using languages for interaction, languages develop with the evolution of the mental space and the symbol space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>So, the creation of a semantic link depends not only on the neighbor links and rules but also on interactions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>As depicted in Fig.10 (c), the cyber space can visualize the semantic link networks for humans to operate according to the semantic images in mind.</a>
