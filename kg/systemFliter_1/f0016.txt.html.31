<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Namely, what one man builds as a reasoning method into his program, another can express as a fact using a richer ontology.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Then MYCIN might have to make a plan for getting rid of the patient's fever and verifying that it was gone as a part of the plan for using the antibiotic.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>However, this information is not obtained by using the formula for a falling body or the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>For example, if I spill the glass of water on the podium, everyone knows that the glass will break and the water will spill.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>or even "What bad things might happen if I give this patient penicillin?</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>I can see part of the front of a person in the audience, and my idea of his shape uses this information to approximate his total shape.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>There is often no clear separation in the program between determining what inferences are correct and the strategy for finding the inferences required to solve the problem at hand.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>This property or relation is constrained by some sentences taken as assumptions, but there is still some freedom left.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Suppose, for example, a certain antibiotic had the precondition for its usefulness that the patient not have a fever.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>An important new development in AI (since the middle 1970s) is the formalization of nonmonotonic reasoning.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>For example, if a patient has cholera, while the antibiotic is killing the cholera bacteria, the damage to his intestines is causing loss of fluids that are likely to be fatal.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>MYCIN's doesn't require this, but our hypothetical robot physician would have to draw conclusions from a patient's appearance, and computer vision is not ready for it.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Perhaps if I knew more about bacterial diseases, I would conclude that their treatment sometimes really does require planning and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Thus I don't expect him to stick out two feet in back even though I can't see that he doesn't.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Some concluded that therefore logic is not an appropriate formalism.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>If you then learn that my car is being fixed (which does not contradict what you knew before), you no longer conclude that you can get a ride.</a>
