<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>2) The simplest possibility for truths(c) for a particular context c is that it is an arbitrary set of propositions, i.e.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>2) Sentences about propositions and contexts are built up from a formula ist(c,p) which is to be understood as asserting that the proposition p is true in the context c.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The simplest approach to a logic of context is to treat ist(c,p) as a modal operator with p quantifier free.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>9) There is often a theory associated with a context|the set of sentences true in the context.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is a fact of epistemology (both of the physical world and the mathematical world).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>3) The second possibility is that truths(c) is closed under deduction in some logical system|perhaps the theory of contexts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As with truths(c), domain(c) may be an object, presumably in a higher level context, or it may be only in the metalanguage.</a>
