<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Different from other individuals, humans can actively link symbols to the physical space, and to the socio space through the physiological space, psychological space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As human behaviors will influence the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space through the cyber space, previous security issues isolated in one space will pass through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As shown in Fig.16, thoughts are inspired by the requirements raised in the socio space and the co-experiences in the physical space, socio space, artifact space, physiological space, and psychological space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(9) Emerging a semantic image according to a given network in the physical space or socio space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space so that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>As the effect of learning and using languages for interaction, languages develop with the evolution of the mental space and the symbol space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Languages are rules of composing symbols for indicating and linking semantic images in the mental space during interaction [24].</a>
