<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Thus the theory of sequential circuits is an approximate theory, and it is not an approximation to a definite less approximate theory of purely digital circuits.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We propose to extend the ontology of logical AI to include approximate objects, approximate predicates and approximate theories.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>6) The human reasoning processes involving common sense knowledge correspond only partly to the mathematical and logical reasoning processes that humans have used so successfully within scientific and mathematical theories.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>8) Key tools for common sense reasoning by machines will be approximate concepts and approximate theories.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The article treats successively approximate objects, approximate theories, and formalisms for describing how one object or theory approximates another.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>9) The most important notion of approximation for common sense reasoning is not the familiar numerical approximation but a new kind of logical approximation appropriate for common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Approximate concepts are essential for representing common sense knowledge and doing common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One approximate theory may be less approximate than another.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>are then approximate concepts, and the theory is an approximate theory.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The large number of approximate concepts we discuss are approximate in different ways, but we don't have a classification.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We want to discuss relations between sentences in a theory and sentences in a less approximate theory.</a>
