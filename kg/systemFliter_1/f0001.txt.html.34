<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) single text [Luhn et al., 1958], (2) multiple texts [McKeown, 1995] [Radev, et al., 1998, 2002] [Nanba et al., 1999] [Agarwal et al., 2011], and (3) hybrid, which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them so that readers can know more relevant contents.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Observing and rethinking the basic characteristics of human language use can inspire research on summarization as language use including listening, speaking, reading, writing, understanding, and thinking.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It is feasible to transform a citation network into a text by using some language patterns (for example, "the idea of A was extended by B", "the idea of A was used by B", and "the idea of A inspired B") to represent different citations, main roles, relations, and development track.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The above principle means that even people sharing the represented knowledge may not be the suitable person for summarizing the representation because they may not have the knowledge of representation.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
