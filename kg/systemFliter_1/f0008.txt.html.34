<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The hierarchical resource space can be transformed into the equivalent u'\u2018' flat' resource space by projecting each leaf node of the coordinate tree onto the axis where the root resides [35][36], but this projection makes a resource space lose abstraction layers.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To implement a smart resource space that can adapt itself, the resource space needs to trace the active points in the user's mental space and previous queries so that adaption is in line with the evolution of user's mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A resource space that does not satisfy 2NF is useful in applications since sometimes dependent coordinates cannot be avoided in applications due to the understanding gap between the resource space creater, the users who input resources, the users who retrieve resources, and the authors of the resources.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The resource space can automatically detect and upload resources by matching the pattern in resources and the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Discover the resource pattern in the candidate resource set according to the classification trees of the resource space and the given matching degree.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Without knowing the relations between coordinates, and the relations between coordinate and axis, it is difficult to calculate the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point according to the membership probability that the resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is because a resource in the probabilistic resource space can be inserted into a point if its membership probability belonging to this point is larger than 0.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A 1NF resource space can be transformed into a 2NF or a 3NF resource space by merging the inter-dependent coordinates at one axis into a complex coordinate.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If two resource spaces RS1(X1, ..., Xm, Y1, ..., Yn) and RS2(Y1, ..., Yn, Z1, ..., Zk) specify the same type of resources and have n common axes, then they can be put together as one resource space RS(X1, ..., Xm, Y1, ..., Yn, Z1, ..., Zk) such that RS1 and RS2 share these n common axes and RS = RS1 + RS2 u'\u2212' n.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A resource space with the same structure can be created in the cyber space according to the mental resource space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) Normal forms have more impact on resource distribution in the resource spaces than the distribution in the probabilistic resource spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a resource management model based on multi-dimensional classifications [35][36].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A resource space is an n-dimensional classification space represented as RS(X1, X2, ..., Xn), where Xi are dimensions (i.e., axes) defined by a set of coordinates.</a>
