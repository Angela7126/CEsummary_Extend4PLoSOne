<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Various metadata, information retrieval techniques, statistical techniques, classi u'\ufb01' cation techniques, reasoning techniques (relational, inductive and analogical reasoning), text analysis and social network analysis can suggest semantic links but are not su u'\ufb03' cient to create rich semantic images, which evolve with constant interaction.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Integrating these techniques, studying interaction behaviors, and tracing interactions and recording the content of interaction and the co-occurrence scenes, sounds, objects, individuals and events can obtain more indication when waving semantic images.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The SLN of texts enables individuals to read and write in natural languages through semantic lens so that a piece of text can be viewed from different facets, abstraction levels, scales and versions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In recent ten years, some researchers have moved focus from human intelligence to analyzing the artifacts of humans, e.g., to extract implicit and previously unknown rules from data [18].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Complex network analysis, data mining and semantic web initiate research independently but almost at the same time when researchers pay more attention to artifacts than human intelligence.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The study of interactive semantics would help individuals (humans and agents) to interact with each other cross times and cultures in the future cyber-society u'\u2014' the fusion of human society and virtual digital world.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantically linked points in the classi u'\ufb01' cation space S form a structure <S, L, Rules> that helps individuals build and explain semantic images through an internalization process and an externalization process.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ordinary image statically re u'\ufb02' ects object or scene, while semantic images dynamically re u'\ufb02' ect classi u'\ufb01' cation, object, individual, relation, rule, and interaction.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>During sensing or indicating, individuals continuously relate sense to previously built semantic images to update or rebuild semantic images.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The key issue is how to automatically link diverse types of resources and coordinate semantic link networks according to diverse individuals' interests that may change from time to time.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Different from the creationist point of view, Charles Darwin's theory on the origin of species argues that populations evolve over generations through a process of natural selection.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Explaining a point is to show its object items including indicators, attributes, explanations and experiences through the channels suitable for the object items.</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Newton perceived the natural semantics about object movement, built individual semantic image about the law, and then externalized the individual semantic image onto paper through language.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The SLN of points is a large granularity SLN where any point can include object and relevant sounds, symbols, events and scenes.</a>
