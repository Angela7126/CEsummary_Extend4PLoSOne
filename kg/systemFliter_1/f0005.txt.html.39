<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is the cognitive systems that discover knowledge through interacting with the physical space, representing information, building concepts, proposing and verifying assumptions in the representation space, and externalizing knowledge with a certain form of representation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(3) System-to-system interaction, e.g., interaction among information modeling system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge modeling system according to the rules for coordinating these systems.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Big data may mislead analysis if data are not hold by the dimensions of the observed complex system.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Big data are mapped into a data space by establishing and classifying links.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>So, it requests a representation that can help human recognize the complex system that generates big data.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Knowledge is the source and the result of data analysis.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>As a complex system, a big country like China generates big economic data everyday, with thousands of dimensions.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>If appropriate dimensions can be established on big data, a multi-dimensional space can significantly divide the volume of data (Zhuge, 2008;</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A multi-dimensional classification space can be designed by human according to domain analysis or automatically generated by extracting dimensions from the representations of data.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Human understand external representation according to the internal semantic link network of concepts.</a>
