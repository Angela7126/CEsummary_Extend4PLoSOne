<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Burning one's bridges, nailing the flag to the mast, and promising to love until death do us part are examples of actions that reduce choices.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a training set of (say) 32 combinations permits the ape to do the remaining 32 without further trial and error, it would be reasonable to conclude that the ape can predict the effects of the successive bounces.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He compares determinism and inevitability, and makes definitions so that in a deterministic world, not all events that occur are inevitable.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If we wanted robots susceptible to schizophrenia, we would have to program in something like schizophrenia, and it would be a complicated and unmotivated undertaking -- unmotivated by anything but the goal of imitating human schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, the number of possible tic-tac-toe positions is small enough so that one could make a program with the same external behavior that just looked up each position in a table to determine its move.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Starting with simple systems is the practice in AI, because only what is understood can be implemented in computer programs.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Do animals, even apes, ever make decisions based on comparing anticipated consequences?</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>If the patient's belief caused him to kill someone whom he imagined to be a CIA agent, he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>People and chess programs carry thinking about choice beyond the first level.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If the ape can mentally follow the prize as it would bounce from baffle to baffle, it will succeed.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>intentional behavior, because full generality is beyond the state of the art.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>I am doubtful about the generalization, because I don't see how to represent commonsense preferences between actions except in terms of preferring one resulting situation to another.</a>
