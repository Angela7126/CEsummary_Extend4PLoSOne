<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Language representations like tags indicate the usage of the pictures.</a>
