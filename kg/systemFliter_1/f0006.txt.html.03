<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Individual is the abstraction of natural resources, humans, and artefacts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(4) The separation of cyberspace from symbol space and artefact space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>CPSoc is a complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) The separation of symbol space from mental space and artefact space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Human bodies belong to the physical space, behaviours belong to social space, and thoughts belong to mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Essentially, only human can understand the information of the spaces and build the images (semantic images) in mind.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is a challenge to link thought to thought, and link thought to sketch, to design, and further to the process of production.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>More importantly, humans have the ability to link symbols to the mental space and to the physical space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(1) The separation of mental space from the physical space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>There is a big gap between the semantic image of human and data in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>3 depicts the structure of CPSoc and the relationships among CPSoc, IoT and CPS.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(5) Principles of interaction, transformation and flows.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>CPSoc will extend the ability of humans to reflect the physical space, to conveniently interact with each other, to classify/cluster/locate individuals, to search/surf/zoom in cyberspace, and to locate/reason/navigate in mental space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(2) The separation of society from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Similar to IoT, Web of Things (WoT) is to connect various devices and objects to the Web through Web standards [15].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Principles and methods in cyberspace, physical space or social space may not be suitable for the new space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In cyberspace, zooming is an effective means to navigate through different view levels and reduce the scope of destination.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>One tree will be different from the other tree, and one apple will be different from the other apple.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The cyberspace holds, links, and displays data as network.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>pHumans are able to observe and participate in social processes, to think, and to know the effect of establishing a relation.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>With the generation and development of human beings, individual mental spaces are gradually separated from physical human bodies.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The design of CPS needs to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way [16].</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Real-time modelling in Cyber-Physical Society is based on the network of data, especially big data.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Human beings will live and develop with Cyber-Physical Society (in short CPSoc), which consists of cyberspace, physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>understanding of the object and the physical world, and technology, e.g., transformation from physical characteristics into electronic characteristics.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Various interactions between individuals form and evolve the structure of spaces.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Cyber-Physical-Socio Intelligence studies intelligence in the complex space, concerning human intelligence, socio intelligence, machine intelligence, and complex intelligence [5].</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>With interaction among the natural physical space, society and economy, the data network keeps changing.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>It is also a science and engineering of developing and managing the new complex space.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Previous research on semantics, knowledge and Grid can be extended to explore the foundation of CPSoc [24] and [25].</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>However, models and theory sometimes cannot reflect the real due to the limitation of human understanding of the real world.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>CPSoc holds humans, machines and physical space.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Humans will play roles in the loop and out of the loop [19] and [20].</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Logistic processes will leave semantic images in cyberspace and can be adapted according to the change of demand.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>pNetworks pervade the nature, society, and virtual worlds, giving structure and function to a variety of resources and behaviours.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>Different from Cyber-Physical Systems, Cyber-Physical Society concerns the structure and function of the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space, and the study of its laws and principles.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>In super-link network, a node in any space can link to any node in any space, link can be of any type suitable for transmitting a certain type of information and influence can be in or through spaces.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Natural sciences concern the structures and laws of natural systems.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>The fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and socio space will fuse sciences and technologies specific to single space to form a new theory and method for studying and developing Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Human life is more and more in the artefact space and gradually away from the natural physical space.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>At current stage, humans are still far from understanding the physical space, and the state-of-the-art technology is not able to get the real information of things.</a>
