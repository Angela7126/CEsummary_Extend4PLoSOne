<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the Virtual Observatory, most the data will be remote.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The remote data volume may be huge;</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus, astronomy data on the Grid will generally reside in read-intensive databases that will be accessed by associative query interfaces that subset the data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus, the archives have only 12% of the total data and less than 25% of the public data (data is typically made public after a year).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The huge data volumes require a parallel search capability with direct random access of certain objects.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, while every instrument produces a steady data stream, there is an ever more complex worldwide network of facilities with large output data sets.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As the amount of data is doubling every year, in three years the data grows by eightfold.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>therefore, it makes sense to move as much of the data processing as near the data as possible, because in many cases after the first few steps of processing the output volume is dramatically smaller (e.g., extracting object catalogs).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As more and more data access is through automated facilities, it is increasingly important to capture the details of how the data was derived and calibrated.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>[15] (Chapter CONCEPTS), Open Grid Services Architecture [16] (Chapter OGSA), virtual data systems such as Chimera [17], SQL databases, and development environments like .Net and Websphere would have made the task much simpler.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Many potential astronomy applications require access at the granularity of objects rather than entire files.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Nevertheless, there are clear grammatical rules for encapsulating complex information in a machine-readable form, and there are style sheets that render XML data to various easily understandable formats.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As a result, data access to remote resources needs to be just as transparent as if it were local.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thus, the community's total processing, networking, and storage costs are likely to remain stable over time, despite exponential growth in data volumes.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>MAST, GLU, and AstroGrid are sample portals [1, 6, 8.] As one of the first experiments of the international Virtual Observatory effort, more than fifty different archives over the world provide a cone search interface for a Web search [3].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The requested data may be created by a complex pipeline on the fly, according to the user's specification, like a recalibration and custom object detection run on an image built as a mosaic from its parts.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The data and derived products were collected at great expense, so the data should be safely stored at two or more locations.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Astronomical data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling approximately every year as Moore's law improvements in semiconductors provide better computers and detectors.</a>
