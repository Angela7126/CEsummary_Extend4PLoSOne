<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The hierarchical resource space can be transformed into the equivalent u'\u2018' flat' resource space by projecting each leaf node of the coordinate tree onto the axis where the root resides [35][36], but this projection makes a resource space lose abstraction layers.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The probabilistic relational table satisfying 1NF is limited in ability to represent the probabilities of attribute values, and, using tuple probabilities to specify the probabilities of attributes' values could lead to information loss or combinatorial explosion of tuples.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to the current classification in the mental space, the user needs to outline the Classification Tree (denoted as CT) for each axis in the cyber resource space, where the higher layer consists of more general classifications, and the lower layer consists of more specific classifications.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) 1NF resource space RS1(Topics, Years, Locations), where Topics = {Browser&Interfaces, DataMining, e-Applications, Practice&Experience, Performance&Scalability, Ubiquitous, Search, Sercurity&Reliability, SemanticWeb, WebEngineering, XML&WebData, WebServices, Ontologies, E-Learning, WebMining, Multimedia}, Years = {2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007} and Locations = {Hong Kong, Hawaii, Budapest, New York, Chiba, Edinburgh, Banff}.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since a linear programming problem is tractable in polynomial time, the membership probability interval that any resource r belongs to point p can be obtained in polynomial time of the number of points in RS.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the resource spaces in the cyber space share some dimensions (axes) with the user mental space, users are easy to find the required resources.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(3) It enables users to access relevant class hierarchies of resource space at different probabilities when their mental spaces lack accurate classification about the target.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This paper firstly introduces the resource space model based on multi-dimensional classifications, and shows its characteristics by comparing with the relational data model in section 2.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The generalization and specialization on classifications enable users or applications to effectively organize and manage heterogeneous resources according to contents.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The relational data model is based on the flat relational table, and its normalization basis is the functional dependence relations between attributes.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Form the candidate resource set by merging the search result with the temporal set (initial state is empty).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Dataspace is to realize effective personal information management by integrating resources from various types of data sources that may be uncertain.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A resource space that does not satisfy 2NF is useful in applications since sometimes dependent coordinates cannot be avoided in applications due to the understanding gap between the resource space creater, the users who input resources, the users who retrieve resources, and the authors of the resources.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>To implement a smart resource space that can adapt itself, the resource space needs to trace the active points in the user's mental space and previous queries so that adaption is in line with the evolution of user's mental space.</a>
