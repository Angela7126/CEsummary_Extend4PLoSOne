<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Humans have the ability to summarize non-symbol representations, which can be regarded as a different dimension from text.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Important sentences can be extracted out according to the statistical analysis and experience on the input text while making abstraction needs knowledge on and beyond the text.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
