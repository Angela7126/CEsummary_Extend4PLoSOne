<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Knowledge is the source and the result of data analysis.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The intelligence and personal knowledge of a cognitive system can be examined by Turing test (Turing, 1950).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, it is meaningless to prove the correctness of a representation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It leads to the border of knowledge and essential reinvention.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(5) The reasoning architecture, which is responsible for deriving and justifying knowledge according to the lower cognitive layers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>and, (2) geometry knowledge, which provides the target of abstraction, meta-model and basic concepts for representing the law.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the meaning of representation and the meaning of mapping cannot be determined, the correctness of mapping cannot be proved.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, it is difficult for computer to determine and derive the meaning of representations, to calculate meaning, and to explain result.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(1) Propose the conjecture of the problem (e.g., man-machine symbiosis) in the target domain according to the source (bio-symbiosis relation) and the concepts of the target domain.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(3) Propose the conjecture of the solution according to the source solution and the concepts of the target domain.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Different data sets should be selected from the big data according to different strategies (e.g., on product distribution, price, and business network).</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, big data analysis can only be effective when data analyzers have the knowledge of business strategies, and can link the potential insights to business opportunities.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The natural differences (e.g., in structure, process and function) between human and machine determines that using human behaviors as the standard of evaluating machine is inappropriate.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Social networks form communities in society, which divides people and data they generate and use with the evolution of the communities.</a>
