<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The time dimension records the time of interaction, event occurrence, and adding a semantic link to the semantic link network so that the semantic lens can show semantic image through time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from the centrality principle in general network, linking a new node or adding a new semantic link to a semantic link network could generate new semantic links due to relational reasoning on semantic links.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>During internalizing and externalizing, any individual can access relevant semantic images (the interaction semantic images and individual semantic images) and objects through multiple channels and multiple communities with certain privilege.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) Individual semantic image is a semantic link network (a self-organized semantic model introduced in [51,52]) of objects or points in individual classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>An individual can use multiple semantic models or one model integrating multiple semantic models, e.g., Semantic Link Network + Resource Space Model, Resource Space Model + Database + OWL, etc.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A semantic link network SLN may change when adding a semantic link l to the network and then remove it, because the semantic links derived from the network with l may not be derived from the network without l.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Newton perceived the natural semantics about object movement, built individual semantic image about the law, and then externalized the individual semantic image onto paper through language.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individuals build their own semantic images based on semantic worldview while leaving tracks in the semantic image of the system.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Research on the semantic image will bene u'\ufb01' t from such research as self-organized semantic model, semantic community discovery, emerging semantics, and complex network analysis.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The semantic link network (SLN) and the classi u'\ufb01' cation space can be integrated by mapping the nodes or communities in the semantic link network into the points or subspaces of the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(6) Interaction semantic image is a semantic link network of objects or points in the classi u'\ufb01' cation space shared between individuals.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Various metadata, information retrieval techniques, statistical techniques, classi u'\ufb01' cation techniques, reasoning techniques (relational, inductive and analogical reasoning), text analysis and social network analysis can suggest semantic links but are not su u'\ufb03' cient to create rich semantic images, which evolve with constant interaction.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The simplest emerging principle focuses on a particular semantic path while the massive emerging principle emphasizes on the status of a semantic node or a semantic link in the whole network.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Therefore, the lens can zoom onto the semantic link network from the classi u'\ufb01' cation space or zoom onto the classi u'\ufb01' cation space from the semantic link network.</a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Richness of a semantic node in semantic image is in positive proportion to the number and diversity of the semantic links it has and the richness of its neighbors [51].</a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The re-focusing rate can contribute to the weight of a semantic image and then in u'\ufb02' uence other semantic images through semantic links.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>To become rich, a new node should link to enrich semantic links, that is, the new semantic link should be relevant to the potential neighbor semantic links.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Adding one semantic link to a semantic image could in u'\ufb02' uence the whole semantic image.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Further, when an individual reads the text, the words will be associated with the experiences in the points of the multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space, therefore, a semantic image (a semantic link network of experience) emerges.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Semantic communities are formed within semantic images and evolve with the evolution of semantic images.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The semantic link network can show different semantic views with only interested semantic links.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(1) Individuals tend to interact with each other on the topic relevant to the interaction semantic image or individual semantic images.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>(3) An individual semantic image is re u'\ufb02' ected to a certain degree by the interaction semantic images waved during interacting with other individuals.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>A semantic lens based on self-organized semantic link network and adaptive classi u'\ufb01' cation space is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>A semantic model such as the multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space and the semantic link network is explained by its meta-model, which is further explained by the ISB.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The semantically linked points in the classi u'\ufb01' cation space S form a structure <S, L, Rules> that helps individuals build and explain semantic images through an internalization process and an externalization process.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>The SLN of models enables semantic lens to access and manage objects through various semantic models such as OWL and relational data model.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The ISB provides the basic consensus for various existing or future semantic models to interact with each other and work in cooperation to form stronger semantic indication or explanation.</a>
