<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Virtual Observatory -- sometimes also called the World Wide Telescope -- is under construction in many countries [1, 2, 5, 7, 10] It seeks to provide portals, protocols, and standards that unify the world's astronomy archives into a giant database containing all astronomy literature, images, raw data, derived datasets, and simulation data -- integrated as a single intelligent telescope [25].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, about 25% of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey budget went into building the software pipelines that process the photographic and spectroscopic data and produce catalogs of stars, galaxies, quasi-stellar objects, spectrograms, spectral lines, and redshift estimates.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>[15] (Chapter CONCEPTS), Open Grid Services Architecture [16] (Chapter OGSA), virtual data systems such as Chimera [17], SQL databases, and development environments like .Net and Websphere would have made the task much simpler.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) enables an application to find out the precise calling convention of a remote resource and to build a compatible interface.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The role of author belongs to collaborations, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Human Genome Project, and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Today, both these efforts could exploit systems such as the Chimera virtual data toolkit [17] (which in turn builds on the Globus and Condor toolkits) to save a great deal of effort.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The VO need only provide clear standards, interfaces, documentation, and reference implementations in order to have most data providers adopt a set of core services.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MAST, GLU, and AstroGrid are sample portals [1, 6, 8.] As one of the first experiments of the international Virtual Observatory effort, more than fifty different archives over the world provide a cone search interface for a Web search [3].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The VOTable model specifies a standard coordinate system, standard representations for core astronomical concepts, and standard ways to represent both values and errors.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These complex SkyQuery jobs are excellent applications for facilities for submitting, executing, and managing batch computations, and other facilities for bulk data transfer of results.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Some of these Web services are OGSA services to run long-running analysis jobs on the archive's data and to produce derived datasets -- but most are interactive tasks that extract data on demand for portals and for interactive client tools.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Astronomical data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling approximately every year as Moore's law improvements in semiconductors provide better computers and detectors.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The number of discoveries made after the first few hundred square degrees of observations (high redshift quasars, brown dwarfs) was far out of proportion to the area of sky.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>SDSS, 2MASS, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm, and the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Survey, along with an image Web service.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>There is a slowly emerging trend to describe the processing pipelines in terms of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs:</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Archived astronomy data is usually the end product of a complicated processing pipeline, within which the details of the processing (e.g., detection thresholds for objects) are carefully tuned by each project.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>With current economics, there is rough parity between (1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network traffic, (3) 100,000 instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a terabyte of disk or LAN bandwidth.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Nevertheless, there are clear grammatical rules for encapsulating complex information in a machine-readable form, and there are style sheets that render XML data to various easily understandable formats.</a>
