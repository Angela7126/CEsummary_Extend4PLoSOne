<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Our object is to account for as much behavior as possible by saying the machine or person or animal does what it thinks will achieve its goals.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A more elaborate automatic teller that handles loans, loan payments, traveler's checks, and so forth, may have beliefs like, 'The payment wasn't made on time,' or, 'This person is a good credit risk.</a>
