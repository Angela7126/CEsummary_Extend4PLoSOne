<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>1) Conventional linguistic applications like the referents of pronouns can be treated using contexts as objects, but formalized contexts are also useful for more complex anaphora.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, our present applications of context would work equally well if sentences were used.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>[McC93] discusses lifting a simple theory of above(x,y) as the transitive closure of on(x,y) to an outer situation calculus context that uses on(x,y,s) and above(x,y,s).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>8) Because of the possibility of transcendence, the use of contexts as objects is not just a matter of efficiency.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, two contexts with the same theory need not be the same, because they may have different relations with other contexts.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As requested by Johan van Benthem, this is a brief introduction to the logical formalism for context being explored by John McCarthy and Sasa Buvac at Stanford University.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This presents problems beyond those presented by propositions, because in general the space of values of individual concepts will depend on some outer context.</a>
