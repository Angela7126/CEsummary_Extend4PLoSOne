<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Alain Colmerauer (1981) wrote such a program for rewriting the Pereira-Porto coloring program.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Moreover, just as in the map coloring problem, postponing some variables may remove enough goals involving other variables so that they in turn become postponable.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the programmer can arbitrarily rewrite the program, he may change the logic as well as the control.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, it is also possible for the user to specify that the compiler and/or run-time system look for postponable variables, perhaps by enclosing the clause or part of it within which postponable variables may be expected within a macro.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since some cases of postponability may depend on some variables already having values, additional postponements can be accomplished by a suitable interpreter.</a>
