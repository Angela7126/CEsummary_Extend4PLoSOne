<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Users will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using the network to actively promote the flows of material, energy, techniques, information, knowledge, and services in this environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Individual mental space consists of thoughts (including commonsense, concepts, rules, methods, principles, and theories) and imagination (derivation of links through thoughts).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Humans weave and maintain super-links between spaces, evaluate and evolve socio values, and make final decisions to change personal statuses and to influence the evolution of the spaces in Cyber-Physical Society at certain probability.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Internet of Things (IoT) is to create an Internet-centric network of various devices (Radio-Frequency Identification tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc.), which is expected to interact and cooperate with each other for common goals through unique addressing schemes [14].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It ensures healthy and meaningful life of individuals, and maintains a reasonable rate of expansion of individuals in light of overall capacity and the material, knowledge, and service flow cycles.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Modern city is a typical example of CPSoc, where people communicate through information flow network and knowledge flow network, use various equipments supported by energy flow network, influence through relational network, move through traffic network, and live with material (e.g., food and gas) flow network.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and socio space will fuse sciences and technologies specific to single space to form a new theory and method for studying and developing Cyber-Physical Society.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Different types of resources could be fused on demand to provide services through logistics of materials in physical space, information in cyberspace, knowledge in mental space, human and financial resources in social space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The statuses include health, current micro physical space, socio attributes, individuals who were or are trying to super-link their status, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals under privilege constraints.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Data is continually collected through sensors deployed in the physical space (e.g., temperature meters and cameras) and in socio space (e.g., ticket machines and mobile phones).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>pConnecting various networks and machines with nature, society, and human minds can create a new environment where individuals have semantic images to enhance mutual understanding.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>pNetworks pervade the nature, society, and virtual worlds, giving structure and function to a variety of resources and behaviours.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Interaction is a process of physical action and reaction, socio behaviours, thought exchange or information transmission that changes the statuses of involved individuals.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It enables socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as human physiological, psychological and mental status to be super-linked to create a panoramic interconnection environment for well-being and development.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The integration of the classification space and the semantic link network supports navigation with the features of triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating, and zooming through spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>pCyber-Physical Society is a multi-dimensional complex space that generates and evolves diverse subspaces to contain different types of individuals interacting with, reflecting or influencing each other directly or through cyber, physical, socio and mental subspaces.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Texts and photos in personal Web page will be displayed in real-time and through multi-dimensional senses such as time, location, event, audio and video about the person.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>New methodology should change the progress of science and technology, break boundaries of existing disciplines, and be more insightful and predictable on the nature, socio, humans and culture and on mutual-influence.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Research concerns the principles that individuals in different spaces interact with each other, transform from one form into another, and coordinate through appropriate information, thought, service, material and energy flows.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>With the generation and development of human beings, individual mental spaces are gradually separated from physical human bodies.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Humans make sense of things in a multi-dimensional context, including individual experience, language, history and culture [5].</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Human beings will live and develop with Cyber-Physical Society (in short CPSoc), which consists of cyberspace, physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Society is a space that contains socio individuals (humans, artefacts created and used by humans and events), relations between individuals, worth, authorities, and rules of activities.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Aeroplanes can sense and record some flying data such as location, height, temperature, and fuel, and they have communication ability and can even autopilot according to pre-designed route and program.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Different from Cyber-Physical Systems, Cyber-Physical Society concerns the structure and function of the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space, and the study of its laws and principles.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Study concerns competition, symbiosis and cooperation laws among individuals and among communities in the evolution process of the Cyber-Physical Society, as well as laws of networking, evolving and influencing the super-linked CPSocio networks [21] and [9].</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>In cyberspace, zooming is an effective means to navigate through different view levels and reduce the scope of destination.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Cyberspace plays the role of extending human sensation to cyberspace, physical space, and social space.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Cyber-Physical Society will reflect individuals, communities, interactions and events at multiple semantic layers and link semantic elements in different layers.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Ideally, this environment will be an autonomous, living, sustainable, and intelligent system within which society and nature evolve cooperatively.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Different from control processes and computer algorithms, Cyber-Physical Society works with pervasive interactions between individuals within and cross spaces.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Super-links enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of apple in cyberspace can link to an apple in supermarket or on an apple tree through sensors, and can further link to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>The ideas empirically represent aspirations of developing the future interconnection environment.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>Versatile individuals and socio roles coexist harmoniously yet evolve, provide appropriate on-demand information, knowledge and services for each other, transform from one form into another, interact with each other through various links, and self-organize according to socio value chains.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>An early notion of large-scale human?machine interconnection environment that unites physical space, virtual space and mental space was proposed in 2005 [1], which is actually a scientific definition of CPSoc.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>Many applications employed sensors and actuators to get data and control machines before the terms of IoT and CPS were coined.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Semantic communities at different levels support zooming on semantic link network to obtain semantic views of different abstraction levels.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>A falling apple in the physical space will be able to link to different devices in cyberspace, which incur relevant semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Smart mobile phones will play more important roles in collecting data about humans.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Therefore, IoT and CPS are not essentially new concepts from historical point of view, they can be regarded as the development of relevant techniques.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Super-links will be interactive channels, which will be able to transmit material, content and control information to realize real-time interaction between individuals cross spaces.</a>
