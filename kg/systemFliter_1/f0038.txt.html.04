<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since served data must travel over the PCI twice (once from the disk to memory and then from memory to network, brick input and output are limited to about 40 MBps in serving data to clients.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Compression and encryption can certainly be done with passive media, but the nice thing about storage bricks is that the compression and encryption algorithms are co-located with the data -- so one is archiving or exchanging both the data and the algorithms.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A more interesting possibility is that the operating system can encrypt all the data on the disks, and so prevent the data from being disclosed to anyone not knowing the decryption key.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It can compress the data and so our bricks could claim to be 2.5TB rather than 1TB and the data rate could claim to be 60MBps rather than 25MBps.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One stimulus for this work was our failed effort to move the 5 TB teraserver from one data center to another -- we could write the tapes (slowly) but we could never read them all.</a>
