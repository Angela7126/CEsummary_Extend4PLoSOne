<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(1) Search the resources in the cyber space according to the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to the membership probability on each coordinate, the membership probability on each axis/point in a probabilistic resource space can be calculated by the following methods.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Discover the resource pattern in the candidate resource set according to the classification trees of the resource space and the given matching degree.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(5) The key in P-RSM enables users to operate a resource space according to a part of its axes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>7 for example, the resource space RS(Classes, Courses, Gender) is used to manage student information according to their classes, courses and gender.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A resource space organizes resources by multi-dimensional classification according to the contents of resources, and it supports generalization and specialization on classifications.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Therefore, the normal forms of a given resource space can be automatically verified according to the relations between concepts in the ontology.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since a linear programming problem is tractable in polynomial time, the membership probability interval that any resource r belongs to point p can be obtained in polynomial time of the number of points in RS.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>So, the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point is a complex probabilistic event.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) It enables the mental space and the socio space to interact with the physical space through the cyber spaces, in addition to direct interaction.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A resource space with the same structure can be created in the cyber space according to the mental resource space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If the resource spaces in the cyber space share some dimensions (axes) with the user mental space, users are easy to find the required resources.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For a resource space RS, the point query operation is for selecting the desirable points according to the given restrictions.</a>
