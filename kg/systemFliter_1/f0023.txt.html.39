<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) includes the non-deterministic of Result used to compute which action leads to the better situation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding (2) makes the theory determinist by specifying which choice us made.1</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>SDFW is therefore a partial theory that requires extension when we need to account for these phenomena.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We can generalize SDFW by applying preferences to actions rather than to the situations resulting from actions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Just as with equation (1), we can say that person chooses an action that leads to more freedom at the next situation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>He compares determinism and inevitability, and makes definitions so that in a deterministic world, not all events that occur are inevitable.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>by saying what choice a person or machine will make.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>I am doubtful about the generalization, because I don't see how to represent commonsense preferences between actions except in terms of preferring one resulting situation to another.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Thinking about one's free will requires theoretical structure beyond or above SDFW.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We want to say that situation s1 is at least as free as situation s2, written s1 \geq_{freedom} s2, if every fluent achievable by a single action from s2 is achievable from s1.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Starting with simple systems is the practice in AI, because only what is understood can be implemented in computer programs.</a>
