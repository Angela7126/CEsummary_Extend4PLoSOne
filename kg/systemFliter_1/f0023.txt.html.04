<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Much human action and almost all animal action reacts directly to the present situation and does not involve anticipating the consequences of alternative actions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A system operating only with situation-action rules in which an action in a situation is determined directly from the characteristics of the situation does not involve free will.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Examining such trees of possibilities is an aspect of free will in the world, but the simplest form of free will in a deterministic world does not involve branching more than once.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We can now give a situation calculus theory for SDFW illustrating the role of a non-deterministic theory in determining what will deterministically happen, i.e.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We want to say that situation s1 is at least as free as situation s2, written s1 \geq_{freedom} s2, if every fluent achievable by a single action from s2 is achievable from s1.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>4) Whether a human or an animal uses simple free will in a type of situation is subject to experimental investigation -- as discussed in section 7.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They can involve fearing that one's preferences in the future might be different from one's present preferences for future actions or that making a commitment about one's future actions confers a present benefit.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This deterministic decision process uses a nondeterministic theory to present the set of available actions and the consequences of each of them.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We believe this simple theory covers the most basic phenomenon of human free will.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>When a person, animal, or machine reacts directly to a situation rather than comparing the consequences of alternative actions, free will is not involved.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As we see, greedy John has a choice of at least two actions in situation S0 and prefers a situation in which he has greater wealth to one in which he has lesser wealth.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>However, it is not an exercise of free will in my sense.2 On the other hand, deciding whether or not to go through some bushes where there was a danger of getting hit in the eye on the basis of weighing the advantages against the dangers would be an exercise of free will in my sense.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Thus when a frog sees a fly and flicks out its tongue to catch it, the frog is not comparing the consequences of catching the fly with the consequences of not catching the fly.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The theory of greedy John formalized by (3) may be about as simple as possible and still involves free will.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>3) It breaks the phenomenon of free will into parts and considers the simplest systems first -- in contrast to approaches that demand that all complications be understood before anything can be said.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>2) The above theory captures the most basic feature of human free will.</a>
