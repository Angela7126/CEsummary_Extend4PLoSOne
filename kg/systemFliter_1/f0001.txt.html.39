<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding indicate the following dimensions for evaluating a summarization:</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
