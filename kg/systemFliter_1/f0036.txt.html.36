<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(1) We can reduce disk accesses by caching popular (hot) pages in main memory, and writing a log of their changes to disk.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>* On random workloads, disk mirroring is preferable to RAID5 parity because it spends disk space (which is plentiful) to save disk accesses (which are precious).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So track-sized sequential transfers maximize disk bandwidth and arm utilization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a disk costs $1200 and does 120 accesses per second, then a disk access per second costs $10.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>disk cost 10$/MB in that era, five times what RAM costs today.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>RAID5 uses up to four disk accesses to do a write, and improves read bandwidth only if the data requests go to different disks.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>So 1990s disk data can afford to live in RAM today.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>By using RAID (mirroring or parity), administrators sacrifice disk storage capacity to protect against disk media failures.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This should be balanced against the cost of the disk to store the pages -- but as mentioned earlier, $12 will buy a LOT of disk space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These techniques will continue to yield benefits as disk accesses become even more precious.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>At that time a GB of disk cost about a million dollars, and so it made sense to have someone optimizing it and monitoring the use of disk space.</a>
