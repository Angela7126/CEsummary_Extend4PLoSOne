<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A big idea in computing history is to transform the thinking computing model u'\u23af' u'\uf8e7' Turing machine into an implementation model by viewing program as data and enabling programs to be fetched and stored in the same way as data (Neumann, 1958).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The information modeling system transforms data (e.g., texts) into information with computable information models (e.g., proposition network, cognitive map, probability models and generative models) and measures (e.g., measuring information quantity in text) through reading, or transforms information into text(s) according to information models (e.g., generative model).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A key task of data analysis is to select small number of dimensions, to ensure their independency and each of which can specify all data of the space so that all data can be access from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, big data analysis can only be effective when data analyzers have the knowledge of business strategies, and can link the potential insights to business opportunities.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If a system cannot answer a question but it can do within the given time after inputting the data (including tables, texts, images, videos), then we say that the system has obtained certain knowledge from the data and it has the ability of processing the data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The linked data is a method of enabling data on the Web from different sources to be connected and queried based on Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF, www.w3.org/RDF/), Web Ontology Language (OWL, www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and SPARQL query language for RDF (www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Big data may mislead analysis if data are not hold by the dimensions of the observed complex system.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This indicates that it is unreasonable to use human representation (e.g., human classification result) as criteria to evaluate machine representation (e.g., machine classification result), which is widely used in computing areas such as information retrieval and classification.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>How to provide real-time services for scientific exploration and thinking according to computing on big data is a research issue.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Big data are mapped into a data space by establishing and classifying links.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(2) Representation for computers to process and calculate (denoted as Rep(C) in table 1), which enables computers to store and compute, for example, data type and data structures.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>So, data should be collected with clear goal and plan of use, otherwise data make no sense no matter whether it is big or not.</a>
