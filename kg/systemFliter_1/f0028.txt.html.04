<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Scientists need a way (1) to use intelligent indices and data organizations to subset the search, (2) to use parallel processing and data access to search huge datasets within seconds, and (3) to have powerful analysis tools that they can apply to the subset of data being analyzed.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Database systems provide very powerful data definition tools to specify the abstract data formats and also specify how the data is organized.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Database systems provide two forms of data independence termed physical data independence and logical data independence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Science data centers that provide access to both the data and the applications that analyze the data are emerging as service stations for one or another scientific domain.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But the key point of this section is that an explicit and standard data access layer with precise metadata and explicit data access is essential for data independence.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>They provide non-procedural and parallel data search to quickly find data subsets, and a many tools to automate data design and management.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition, data analysis using data cubes has made huge advances, and now efforts are focused on integrating machine learning algorithms that infer trends, do data clustering, and detect anomalies.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>While physical data independence is used to hide changes in the physical data organizations, logical data independence hides changes in the logical organization of the data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Separating the data and the metadata from the programs that manipulate the data is crucial to data independence.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>When a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers, then there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>We argue that the smart notebook will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The system uses a combination of Oracle to manage some of the file archive and also a physics-specific data analysis system called Root for data analysis .</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Traditional database systems have lagged in supporting core scientific data types but they have a few things scientists desperately need for their data analysis:</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Some scientists may bring the small data extracts "home" for local processing, analysis and visualization -- but it will be possible to do all the analysis at the data center using the personal workspace.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Increasingly, the datasets are so large, and the application programs are so complex, that it is much more economical to move the end-user's programs to the data and only communicate questions and answers rather than moving the source data and its applications to the user's local system.</a>
