<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Updating an SLN schema concerns resource types, semantic link types, and reasoning rules.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) Compute the classification of the semantic link types in S according to the definition of the closure of semantic relative and the rule set rs denoted as {L1, L2,..., Lk}.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is easy to verify that all closures of the single semantic link types construct a classification for the semantic link types of the SLN schema, and we can decompose an SLN schema based on such a classification.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The resource type set and semantic link type set for the sub-schemas will also change.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>That means reasoning on such a semantic link network is closed.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The essence of semantic rule-constraint normal form is to classify the semantic link type set into different parts according to the rule set.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>All semantic link types at one semantic relative cycle construct an equivalent class according to Lemma 2.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This algorithm is efficient because the up-closure for a semantic link type may be much smaller than the original link type set, and the projection may be sparse in light of semantic links.</a>
