<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, if we examine closely how a human brain (or chess program) deterministically makes decisions, free will (or imitation free will if your philosophy forbids calling it real free will) must come back in.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We want to say that situation s1 is at least as free as situation s2, written s1 \geq_{freedom} s2, if every fluent achievable by a single action from s2 is achievable from s1.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>I am doubtful about the generalization, because I don't see how to represent commonsense preferences between actions except in terms of preferring one resulting situation to another.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If a training set of (say) 32 combinations permits the ape to do the remaining 32 without further trial and error, it would be reasonable to conclude that the ape can predict the effects of the successive bounces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thinking about one's free will requires theoretical structure beyond or above SDFW.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If asked to tell what it is doing, humans or some machine will tell about their choices for action and say that they intend to determine which action leads to the best consequence.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We can generalize SDFW by applying preferences to actions rather than to the situations resulting from actions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>SDFW is therefore a partial theory that requires extension when we need to account for these phenomena.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If we wanted robots susceptible to schizophrenia, we would have to program in something like schizophrenia, and it would be a complicated and unmotivated undertaking -- unmotivated by anything but the goal of imitating human schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Adding (2) makes the theory determinist by specifying which choice us made.1</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Burning one's bridges, nailing the flag to the mast, and promising to love until death do us part are examples of actions that reduce choices.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>He considers that freedom evolves in such a way as to make more and more events evitable, especially events that are bad for the organism.</a>
