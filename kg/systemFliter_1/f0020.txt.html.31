<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The article treats successively approximate objects, approximate theories, and formalisms for describing how one object or theory approximates another.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus the theory of sequential circuits is an approximate theory, and it is not an approximation to a definite less approximate theory of purely digital circuits.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This makes the concept of D flipflop itself approximate, perhaps not in the same sense as some other approximate theories.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Approximate concepts are essential for representing common sense knowledge and doing common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These present a general reason for using approximate concepts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Similar considerations would apply if we were relating it to a more comprehensive but still approximate theory.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A sentence involving an approximate concept may have a definite truth value even if the concept is illdefined.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>6) The human reasoning processes involving common sense knowledge correspond only partly to the mathematical and logical reasoning processes that humans have used so successfully within scientific and mathematical theories.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Suppose a robot uses T1 as a theory of the blocks world and takes actions accordingly, but the real world corresponds to T2.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As a logical theory it would have sentences like.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If this is too platonic for your taste, you can regard approximating the world as a different notion than that of one theory approximating another.</a>
