<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>However, this argument is at a meta-level to the Minsky and Stefanuk proofs and therefore can't claim to be non-creative.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Subtracting, one domino projects from the 3-diagonal to the 4-diagonal.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The reason is to establish that there is one idea in each of the cases.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is a kind of program, but it doesn't need a termination condition, because the termination is apparent to the problem solver.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>According to a 1999 personal communication, the idea can be expressed more concisely.</a>
