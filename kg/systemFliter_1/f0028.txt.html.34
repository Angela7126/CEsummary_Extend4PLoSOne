<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>These data models can also represent data lineage and other metadata by including narrative text, data definitions, and data tables within the file.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But the key point of this section is that an explicit and standard data access layer with precise metadata and explicit data access is essential for data independence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Increasingly, the datasets are so large, and the application programs are so complex, that it is much more economical to move the end-user's programs to the data and only communicate questions and answers rather than moving the source data and its applications to the user's local system.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this model, data analysis proceeds by searching all the relevant files -- opening each file, extracting the relevant data and then moving onto the next file.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Many scientists will prefer doing much of their analysis at data centers because it will save them having to manage local data and computer farms.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>So, it is paradoxical that the data management community has worked for 40 years to achieve something called data independence -- a clear separation of programs from data.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If scientists are to read data collected by others, then the data must be carefully documented and must be published in forms that allow easy access and automated manipulation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>By allowing such techniques, physical data independence allows performance improvements by reorganizing data for parallelism -- at little or no extra effort on the part of scientists.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So our focus here is on data exploration, interactive data analysis, and integration of Level 2 datasets.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Analyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies requires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects -- finding both needles in the haystack and finding very small haystacks that were undetected in previous measurements.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The scientific file-formats of HDF, NetCDF, and FITS can represent tabular data but they provide minimal tools for searching and analyzing tabular data.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Scientific instruments and computer simulations are creating vast data stores that require new scientific methods to analyze and organize the data.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Using a database allows queries to define more sophisticated mesh partitions and allows concurrent indexed access to the simulation data for visualization and computational steering.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Failed data can be automatically recovered from the redundant copies with no interruption to database access, much as RAID5 disk arrays do today.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Views are used to solve these problems by dynamically translating data to the appropriate formats (converting among character and number representations, converting among 6-digit and 9-digit postal codes, converting between long-and-short names, and hiding new information from old programs.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>As mentioned earlier, scientists often start with numeric data arrays from their instruments or simulations.</a>
