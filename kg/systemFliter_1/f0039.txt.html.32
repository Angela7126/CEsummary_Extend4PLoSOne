<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>My simple advice is to stick with low degrees of SMP and work hard on program locality so that you have streamed access to the memory.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If an astronomer is interested in a particular part of the dataset, she can copy that part to a local parallel server (costing 1k$/terabyte of disk including the processors to manage and search that terabyte).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Astronomers will be able to send queries to the server and get back answers either immediately (if it is a simple question) or within an hour (if the question requires scanning the entire archive).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>That is surprisingly rare (for a variety of reasons data in physics, in geology, in medicine, in finance, and in the Internet is encumbered by privacy and by commercial interests).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Moore's law applies more generally to microprocessor clock speeds (they have been doubling every 18 months for a long time), disk capacity (doubling every 12 months since 1990), and network bandwidth (doubling every 8 months according to George Gilder (and others) [Gilder].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Among other things it means that if you can afford to store the data for one time period (a year) then storing it forever only doubles the hardware cost.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>access ratios are changing, and forcing us to change our processing strategy by making things more sequential, and by using both pipeline and partition parallelism.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If we can put a Graphical query interface on the front of this, and a good data visualization system on the output, we should be able to allow astronomers to do data analysis without having to write programs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Now most operating systems are willing to offload much of the tcp/ip protocol to the NIC (checksums, DMA, interrupt moderation, buffering) so the software is much less of a bottleneck.</a>
