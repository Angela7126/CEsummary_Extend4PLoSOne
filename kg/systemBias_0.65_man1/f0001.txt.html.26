<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different persons can make different summaries for the same text, and one person can generate different summaries for the same text at different times.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Different summaries may represent different characteristics of the summarizer.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>So, the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A satisfied summary can be reached only through an open social process of interactions and representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(3) Making summarization through human-machine interaction, which can make full use of the advantages of both human and machines.</a>
