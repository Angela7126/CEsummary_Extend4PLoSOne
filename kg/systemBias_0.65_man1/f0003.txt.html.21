<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
