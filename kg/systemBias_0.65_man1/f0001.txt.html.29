<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(5) Transforming summarizations into the problem of searching suitable persons or summaries in the social networks of authors, readers, summarizers, representations and links.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A representation can be composed by a set of representations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different persons can make different summaries for the same text, and one person can generate different summaries for the same text at different times.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) Knowledge for representation (e.g., grammars and idioms) and knowledge to be represented (e.g., scientific knowledge) are separated.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A satisfied summary can be reached only through an open social process of interactions and representations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>So, the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The problem of designing a suitable summarizer can be transformed into the problem of searching a suitable summarizer in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This is to pursuit a suitable summary rather than the best summary.</a>
