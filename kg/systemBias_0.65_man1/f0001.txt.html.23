<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The following are principles of selecting a suitable summarizer.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(4) The use of language relies on knowledge.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This is to pursuit a suitable summary rather than the best summary.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(2) Knowledge for representation (e.g., grammars and idioms) and knowledge to be represented (e.g., scientific knowledge) are separated.</a>
