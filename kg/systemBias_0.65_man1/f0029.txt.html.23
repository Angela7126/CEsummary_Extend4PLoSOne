<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If this is an inexpensive test and if there are less than a thousand runs, then one can compute the overlapping run pairs by simply comparing all runs to all others.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.</a>
