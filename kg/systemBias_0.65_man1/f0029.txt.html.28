<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>O1 was on the edge of the run2 footprint and so not all its pixels were observed.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>

<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
