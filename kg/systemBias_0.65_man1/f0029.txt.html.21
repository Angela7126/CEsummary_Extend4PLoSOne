<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
