<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Several artificial intelligence researchers, for example Marvin Minsky (1974) have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>An advanced MYCIN might need to know that a patient won't take a bad tasting medicine unless he is convinced of its necessity.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If you now learn that the car will be out in half an hour you reverse yourself again.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Some concluded that therefore logic is not an appropriate formalism.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>If you then learn that my car is being fixed (which does not contradict what you knew before), you no longer conclude that you can get a ride.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>A judge will side with me.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Perhaps if I knew more about bacterial diseases, I would conclude that their treatment sometimes really does require planning and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>This fact can be used to make a noise, to avoid making a noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of a noise.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>I can see part of the front of a person in the audience, and my idea of his shape uses this information to approximate his total shape.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>This is often enough, but it doesn't cover the important case of concurrent events and actions.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>A mathematical description of circumscription is beyond the scope of this lecture, but the general idea is straightforward.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>For example, MYCIN cannot be asked on behalf of the patient or the administration of the hospital when the patient is likely to be ready to go home.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>For example, if a patient has cholera, while the antibiotic is killing the cholera bacteria, the damage to his intestines is causing loss of fluids that are likely to be fatal.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>For example, if I spill the glass of water on the podium, everyone knows that the glass will break and the water will spill.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>The fact that MYCIN doesn't give a prognosis is certainly a limitation.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Nevertheless, the logical system usually corresponds to a subset of first order logic.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Then MYCIN might have to make a plan for getting rid of the patient's fever and verifying that it was gone as a part of the plan for using the antibiotic.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Suppose, for example, a certain antibiotic had the precondition for its usefulness that the patient not have a fever.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>However, my idea of the shape of his back is less definite than that of the parts I can see.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>There may be some new conclusions, but every sentence that was a deductive consequence of the original hypotheses is still a consequence of the enlarged set.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>A major difficulty is in handling the kind of partial knowledge people ordinarily have.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Everyone knows that this will take a fraction of a second and that the water will not splash even ten feet.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>We could try to provide axioms that will determine whether each kind of object can fly, but this would make the database very large.</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>MYCIN's doesn't require this, but our hypothetical robot physician would have to draw conclusions from a patient's appearance, and computer vision is not ready for it.</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>It can also be used in specific situations involving a noise but also to understand general phenomena, e.g.</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>We will try to divide common sense capability into common sense knowledge and common sense reasoning, but even this cannot be made firm.</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>The situation with which MYCIN deals includes the doctor, the patient and the illness.</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>However, the latter can have problems in handling in a good way the generality he has introduced.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>In other domains, expert systems and other AI programs have to make plans, but MYCIN doesn't.</a>
