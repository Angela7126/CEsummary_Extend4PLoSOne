<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If one takes the controversial view that HDF, NetCDF, FITS, and Root are nascent database systems that provide metadata and portability but lack non-procedural query analysis, automatic parallelism, and sophisticated indexing, then one can see a fairly clear path that integrates these communities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Views serve many purposes including increased security (by hiding attributes from applications and/or users without a legitimate need for access) and enhanced performance (by materializing views defined by complex SQL queries over very large input tables).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In addition, data analysis using data cubes has made huge advances, and now efforts are focused on integrating machine learning algorithms that infer trends, do data clustering, and detect anomalies.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Analyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies requires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects -- finding both needles in the haystack and finding very small haystacks that were undetected in previous measurements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Visualization or better visual exploration is a prime example of an application where success is determined by the ability to map a question formulated in the conceptual framework of the domain ontology onto the querying capabilities of a (meta-) data analysis backend.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One approach to this is to use the MPI (Message Passing Interface) parallel programming environment to write procedural programs that stream files across a processor array -- each node of the array exploring one part of the hierarchy.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We argue that the smart notebook will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Metadata is the descriptive information about data that explains the measured attributes, their names, units, precision, accuracy, data layout and ideally a great deal more.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The schema for a database holds all metadata including table and view definitions as well as information on what indices exist and how tables are mapped to storage volumes (and nodes in a parallel database environment).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The real challenge is building this smart notebook that unlocks the data and makes it easy to capture, organize, analyze, visualize, and publish.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We are most familiar with the Universal Content Descriptors (UCD ) of the Astronomy community that define about a thousand core astrophysics units, measurements, and concepts.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Adaptive Finite Element simulations spend considerable time and programming effort on input, output, and checkpointing.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Modern database systems also provide logical data independence that insulates programs from changes to the logical database design -- allowing designers to add or delete relationships and to add information to the database.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The XML integration in modern Database Management Systems (DBMS) opens the door for existing standards like RDF and OWL.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Database systems are also approaching the peta-scale data management problem driven largely by the need to manage huge information stores for the commercial and governmental sectors.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Longer term, personal workspaces at the data center could become a vehicle for data publication -- posting both the scientific results of an experiment or investigation along with the programs used to generate them in public read-only databases.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Scientific instruments and computer simulations are creating vast data stores that require new scientific methods to analyze and organize the data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>JPEG files start with a header that describes the file layout, and often tells the camera, timestamp, and program that generated the picture.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>MP3 music files and PDF document files have similar roles -- each is in a standard format, each carries some metadata, and each has an application suite to process and generate that file class.</a>
