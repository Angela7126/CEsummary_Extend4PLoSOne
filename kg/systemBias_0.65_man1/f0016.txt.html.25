<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Several artificial intelligence researchers, for example Marvin Minsky (1974) have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>An advanced MYCIN might need to know that a patient won't take a bad tasting medicine unless he is convinced of its necessity.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Some concluded that therefore logic is not an appropriate formalism.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>A judge will side with me.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>If you then learn that my car is being fixed (which does not contradict what you knew before), you no longer conclude that you can get a ride.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>If you now learn that the car will be out in half an hour you reverse yourself again.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Perhaps if I knew more about bacterial diseases, I would conclude that their treatment sometimes really does require planning and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Circumscription allows us to make the known exceptions and to provide for additional exceptions to be added later -- again without changing existing statements.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>For example, penguins, ostriches and birds with certain feathers removed can't fly.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>We could try to provide axioms that will determine whether each kind of object can fly, but this would make the database very large.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>This much is often done by a simpler method -- the closed world assumption discussed by Raymond Reiter.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>We will try to divide common sense capability into common sense knowledge and common sense reasoning, but even this cannot be made firm.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>This common sense physics is contiguous with scientific physics.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>of objects.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Consider the fact that when two objects collide they often make a noise.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Most expert systems, including MYCIN, never infer general statements, i.e.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>a specific bacterium, against a general rule and get a new fact about those objects.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>Typically they match facts about specific objects, e.g.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>This fact can be used to make a noise, to avoid making a noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of a noise.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>Inventing a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events is a major unsolved problem of AI.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>A production rule embodies a fact only as part of a specific procedure.</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>We shall discuss various areas of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>It can also be used in specific situations involving a noise but also to understand general phenomena, e.g.</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>A mathematical description of circumscription is beyond the scope of this lecture, but the general idea is straightforward.</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>Understanding common sense capability is now a hot area of research in artificial intelligence, but there is not yet any consensus.</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>3) The world is extended in space and is occupied by objects that change their positions and are sometimes created and destroyed.</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>A major difficulty is in handling the kind of partial knowledge people ordinarily have.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>In other domains, expert systems and other AI programs have to make plans, but MYCIN doesn't.</a>
