<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary, and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The problem of designing a suitable summarizer can be transformed into the problem of searching a suitable summarizer in cyberspace.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(6) Enabling summarizers to know the background of representations, including technological, social and economic aspects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(5) Transforming summarizations into the problem of searching suitable persons or summaries in the social networks of authors, readers, summarizers, representations and links.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>So, the pursuit of the best summary is insignificant.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(3) Making summarization through human-machine interaction, which can make full use of the advantages of both human and machines.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The suitable person should have similar experience with the author (including education, work, etc.) through which knowledge is learned and shared.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A satisfied summary can be reached only through an open social process of interactions and representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The above separation principles lead to the natural obstacle of summarization.</a>
