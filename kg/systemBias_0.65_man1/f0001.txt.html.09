<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Summarization is involved in representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The core representations in one representation (e.g., text) render its topic.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>a) Core representation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Some summaries incorporate pictures, videos, graphs, or tables into texts.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The core representation renders the core idea of a representation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It is a natural idea to select and organize important sentences from the original text to form a summary.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A solution to implement this idea is to make use of existing summaries made by humans and the corresponding pictures in the networks of pictures, tags, summaries, source texts and people who involved in forming and using these things.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
