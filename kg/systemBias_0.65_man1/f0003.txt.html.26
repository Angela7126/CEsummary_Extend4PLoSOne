<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Versatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
