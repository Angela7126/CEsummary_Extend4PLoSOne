<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The system can display users' personal knowledge flow networks by finding their citations and their co-authors' citations, classifying the articles involved by discipline and chronology, expressing the category semantics for advanced services, linking the categories with the citations, and revealing knowledge flows using the citation network.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The environment records information flow such as email within a research team, extracts useful information flows, analyzes common interests and cooperation relations, and displays the evolution of the flows to help assess the teamwork's effectiveness, for example, whether team members' changing interests match their tasks.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The future interconnection environment will synergize data flows, control flows, and knowledge flows to support appropriate on-demand service flows [11, 12], from which knowledge flow networks will create a live knowledge space that develops independently of machines.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Based on the evolution of relevant knowledge flow networks, this service enables scientists to simulate and estimate the development of a discipline, and thus helps them plan research.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This service can recommend references by retrieving documents from the Web and digital libraries, ranking them according to their citation rates and the roles of the authors, and tracing and analyzing their citation networks to show the references as a network rather than as a list.</a>
