<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Co-experiencing in the physical space, socio space, cyber space and artifact space establishes the semantic links through the socio space, physical space, artifact space and cyber space, and evolves the semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In CP3SME, symbols will be linked to the cyber space, physical space, psychological space, physiological space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The psychological space links the physical space, physiological space and the mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Socio Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the socio space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The mental space reflects the interactions in the socio space, psychological space, physiological space, and symbol space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The symbols space interacts with the cyber space, socio space and mental space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The cyber space interacts with the physical space, socio space and symbol space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
