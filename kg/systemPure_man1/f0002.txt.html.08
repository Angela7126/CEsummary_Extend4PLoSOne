<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A knowledge flow spiral can generate and generalize knowledge during the processing and recycling of knowledge.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Maintaining knowledge energy differences between knowledge nodes and ensuring that only needed knowledge is passed between nodes are critical to realizing an effective knowledge flow spiral.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>self-replication happens in the nodes of hypercycles while external knowledge flow is between nodes of a knowledge flow spiral, and catalytic support happens between nodes while internal knowledge flow is within individual nodes of a knowledge flow spiral.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As a scientific research area evolves, the knowledge flow network evolves with the citation network and behaves differently during different phases.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Reflecting the development of a discipline, the distribution of knowledge energy in a network changes as its citation network evolves.</a>
