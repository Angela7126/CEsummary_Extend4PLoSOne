<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some summaries incorporate pictures, videos, graphs, or tables into texts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The core representations in one representation (e.g., text) render its topic.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>a) Core representation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Summarization is involved in representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A semantic link network of important concepts and relations can help readers quickly know the main cues and measures in representations.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The core representation renders the core idea of a representation.</a>
