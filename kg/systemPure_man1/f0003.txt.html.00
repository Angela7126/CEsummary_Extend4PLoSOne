<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Time dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Evolution simulation can be slowed down by stretching time, which enables the details of evolution to be clearly observed.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This requires CP3SME to have an elastic time dimension and the models for the evolution of communities and individuals.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>They can not only use languages to express ideas but also link the language representations to reasons in multiple spaces, to relevant research, and to applications.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Firstly, individuals can only know a small part of the large-scale networks due to energy limitation and privacy.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Fig.12 compares the hyperlink, the semantic link, and the complex link.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Once things are linked to the Web through the current Web/Internet standards, things will become a part of Web/Internet.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
