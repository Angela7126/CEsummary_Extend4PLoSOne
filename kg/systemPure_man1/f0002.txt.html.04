<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>self-replication happens in the nodes of hypercycles while external knowledge flow is between nodes of a knowledge flow spiral, and catalytic support happens between nodes while internal knowledge flow is within individual nodes of a knowledge flow spiral.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Maintaining knowledge energy differences between knowledge nodes and ensuring that only needed knowledge is passed between nodes are critical to realizing an effective knowledge flow spiral.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A knowledge node (scientist) can deliver knowledge to its peers by forwarding knowledge it has received (for example, forwarding an answer to the node that forwarded the query), or by passing on knowledge it generates (for example, send the answer to the querying node directly).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The future interconnection environment will synergize data flows, control flows, and knowledge flows to support appropriate on-demand service flows [11, 12], from which knowledge flow networks will create a live knowledge space that develops independently of machines.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An effective knowledge flow network enables a research team to be very powerful in generating new knowledge if every node can innovate and output new knowledge to appropriate members.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Invisible knowledge flow networks self-organize and evolve continuously and interact with each other through flows to form an autonomous knowledge space for providing advanced knowledge services.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Scientists can further find out who initiated a knowledge flow in an area, their roles in a flow, changes in their status, the effect of knowledge flows on different areas, and the evolution of a knowledge flow.</a>
