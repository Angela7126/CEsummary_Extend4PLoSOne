<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Knowledge flow spirals are formed when knowledge flows in a network.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>self-replication happens in the nodes of hypercycles while external knowledge flow is between nodes of a knowledge flow spiral, and catalytic support happens between nodes while internal knowledge flow is within individual nodes of a knowledge flow spiral.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A knowledge flow spiral can generate and generalize knowledge during the processing and recycling of knowledge.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Like energy in the physical world, knowledge energy reflects knowledge differences between nodes.</a>
