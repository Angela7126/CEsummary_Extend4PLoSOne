<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>After the coarse spatial match, different astronomers may want to use different morphological and attribute tests to detect spurious matches where a moving object has occluded or changed the attributes of some object or to tease apart adjacent members of a binary system.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Having the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For each Overlap record, this code uses the HTM fRegionGetObjectsFromRegionId function to search the catalog for run1 objects that are in the run1-run2 overlap region but do not yet have a run2 entry in the Match table.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is easy to compute the aggregate statistics for the bundle table once each match record has an assigned bundle ID.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As new runs are acquired, new records are added to the catalog and new records are added to the Match table (which is easily computed incrementally.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Summarizing, given two runs, an object in run1 may match (hit) one or more objects in run2, or it may be a miss in run2.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Masked misses, use the Overlap.run2MasksID which is region ID of the union of the run2 and the HTM code to identify all the Miss objects inside the mask region:</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For example, in Figure 2 object O1 matches O2 and O2 matches O3 but object O1 may not match O3.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
