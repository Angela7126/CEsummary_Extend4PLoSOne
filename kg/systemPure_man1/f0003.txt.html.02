<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Through socio interaction, humans actively create and maintain complex links between spaces, evaluate and evolve socio values, and make final decisions to change personal statuses and influence the evolution of the spaces with certain probability.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Research concerns origin and essence of material, energy, information, knowledge, service, life, mind and society in the environment, harmonious and sustainable development of the environment, and the methodology for studying, developing and maintaining the environment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In 1945, Vannevar Bush introduced the ideal of memex, which could browse and make notes in an extensive on-line text and graphical system, and contain a very large library, personal notes, photographs and sketches, and several screens and a facility for establishing a labeled link between any two points in the entire library [8].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic Web research has formed a research community, although there are some different opinions [45], for example, the logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of relevant phenomena related to semantics, and RDF is similar to SN and the classic conceptual modeling approaches such as entity-relation model and class diagrams in the object-oriented modeling.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, Minsky regarded minds as the collections of vast number of semi-autonomous, intricately connected agents, and gave an explanation of how minds relate to such functions as motivation, language, memory, learning, intentions, and metaphors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Complex links will enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of an apple in the cyber space can be linked to the apples in a supermarket with a price or on an apple tree with the information on temperature and nutrition in soil, linked to the relevant food web, and further linked to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Different from previous symbolized commonsense representation, commonsense in CP3SME will link symbols to semantic images, e.g., the word u'\u2018' professor' links to existing relevant sense and semantic images about teaching, research, publication, project and student.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The environment will ensure healthy and meaningful life of individuals, and maintain a reasonable expansion of population of various individuals and the scopes of behaviors according to the overall capacity and the material, energy, information, knowledge and service flow cycles.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It provides a computational path from sensing and motor action to words and speech acts by combing concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In the CP3SME, co-experiencing in multiple spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of various links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning are the basis of the cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Cyber semantic images reflecting the mental space and the complex space can be effectively preserved and accessed when individuals emerge questions, find answers, and select appropriate individuals to collaborate.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Situation includes health status, current micro environment, socio attributes, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The CP3SME needs a reflexive, self-organized, and adaptive architecture that can preserve semantic images of itself and versatile individuals in lifetime and manage significant behaviours, events and processes (e.g., in daily life, learning, creation and business).</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Experiments have demonstrated that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation to a certain extent [9].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Humans create the artifact space by designing the functions of artifacts, assigning semantic indicators to artifacts to reflect meaning or idea, and linking one another by direct or indirect referencing (e.g., paintings of the same author or times).</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
