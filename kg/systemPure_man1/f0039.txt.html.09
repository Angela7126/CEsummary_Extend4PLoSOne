<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Processor speeds are rising much faster than memory speeds, and processor bandwidth is rising much faster than memory bandwidth.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A single disk can deliver about 30 MBps of data if the disk is read sequentially.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Disk data is 10,000,000 clocks away.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the mean time, there is a tendency to put many processors on a shared memory (Shared Memory Processors or SMP).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>One ratio that is changing is the speed and bandwidth to memory.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>So, main memory speeds have improved about 10x in 40 years.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>storage access times and bandwidth are the scarce resources.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Therefore is increasingly important that large computations lay the data out on disk in a sequential order, and scan it sequentially if possible.</a>
