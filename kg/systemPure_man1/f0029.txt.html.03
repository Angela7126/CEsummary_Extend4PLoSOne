<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Our goal is to compute a table Match( run1, objectID1, run2, objectID2, hitOrMiss) Where the hitOrMiss field takes on one of the values Hit, Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As new runs are acquired, new records are added to the catalog and new records are added to the Match table (which is easily computed incrementally.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Summarizing, given two runs, an object in run1 may match (hit) one or more objects in run2, or it may be a miss in run2.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>ClassificationDistance(run1.positionError, run2.positionError), and run2MasksID is the ID of the union of all the mask regions in run2 (see Figure 1.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, using OpenGIS terminology, define buffer(run1, fuzz) as a region that expands region run1 by the fuzz.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Building the Match hits from a catalog is easy.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, in SDSS the average inter-object distance is 21".</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Now we categorize each miss and put that characterization in the Match table.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For each Overlap record, this code uses the HTM fRegionGetObjectsFromRegionId function to search the catalog for run1 objects that are in the run1-run2 overlap region but do not yet have a run2 entry in the Match table.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Such a test requires precise definitions of the run footprints (spatial extent), and for each run, a list of its masks and their footprints.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When this is done, the Miss table lists all the O1-Run2 misses.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>run1 is optical and run2 is radio or Xray), or O1 is a variable or transient object which varied below the detection threshold in run2, or O1 moved more than the classification distance between the two observations.</a>
