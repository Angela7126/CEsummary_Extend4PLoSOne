<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) single text [Luhn et al., 1958], (2) multiple texts [McKeown, 1995] [Radev, et al., 1998, 2002] [Nanba et al., 1999] [Agarwal et al., 2011], and (3) hybrid, which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them so that readers can know more relevant contents.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The above principle means that even people sharing the represented knowledge may not be the suitable person for summarizing the representation because they may not have the knowledge of representation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>On one hand, a very simple and short representation such as a short paragraph of text and a picture is unnecessary for summarization as they can be quickly understood.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>There could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected according to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences according to the semantic locality principle [Zhuge, 2010].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The closed systems designed by particular persons are unable to make satisfied summarization because only the persons sharing knowledge with the writer can make satisfied summarization.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As new pictures are continually added to the online systems, a good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.</a>
