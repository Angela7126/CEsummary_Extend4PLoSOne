<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Multi-dimensional summarization is a function S(P(d1, ..., dm)) = T(di, ..., dj), which transforms a representation p(d1=p1 ..., dm=pm) in the source space of representations P with dimensions d1, ..., and dm into a representation t(di=ti, ..., dj=pj) in the target space of representations T with dimensions di, ..., and dj (m u'\u2265' j u'\u2265' i u'\u2265' 1) such that t contains the core of p at dimensions di, ..., and dj.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The summarization S of a set of representations P is rendered by its intention Int(P) and extension Ext(B) as follows, where S(Int(P)) is the summarization of the intention of P, S(Int(P) U Ext(P)) is the summarization of the intention and extension of P, p -> p' means that p cites p', {Cite(pi -> p) i in [1, ..., m]} denotes the set of cite representations in pi that cites p, and Cite(pi -> p) describes p from the view of the author of pi.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The common point is regarding text summarization as an automatic process of distilling the most important language representation units from a text to produce an abridged version for a particular task and user [Mani and Maybury, 1999] [Mani, 2001].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) single text [Luhn et al., 1958], (2) multiple texts [McKeown, 1995] [Radev, et al., 1998, 2002] [Nanba et al., 1999] [Agarwal et al., 2011], and (3) hybrid, which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them so that readers can know more relevant contents.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>One form of representation like text usually links to other forms of representation like pictures, and possibly to video, audio and graph, which can be regarded as citation for explanation, complementation or extension.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
