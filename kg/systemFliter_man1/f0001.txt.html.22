<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The faceted navigation approach is not traditional text summarization, but it is a special summarization because it can extract different facets in large text(s) to enable users to read only the interested facet [Xu and Zhuge, 2012].</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
