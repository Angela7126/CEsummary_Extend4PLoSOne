<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Having the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is easy to compute the aggregate statistics for the bundle table once each match record has an assigned bundle ID.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, in Figure 2 object O1 matches O2 and O2 matches O3 but object O1 may not match O3.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Indeed, the SDSS catalog pre-computes the spatial join as the Neighbors table using the Zones algorithm described in [2].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Two objects are said to match if they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Given the bundle and match tables, the pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs, as follows:</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
