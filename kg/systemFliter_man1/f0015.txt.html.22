<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, artificial intelligence is a difficult branch of science and engineering, and, judging by present slow progress, it might take a long time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Daniel Dennett, Tufts University philosopher, has proposed three attitudes aimed at understanding a system with which one interacts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Much that we'll need to know concerns the information stored in computers, which is why we find ourselves using psychological words like 'knows', 'thinks', and 'wants' in referring to machines, even though machines are very different from humans and these words arose from the human need to talk about other humans.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Adopting this principle of rationality, we see that different machines have intellectual qualities to differing extents.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The design stance can usefully be applied to a thermostat -- it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to set it, no matter how it works.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft, it will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In general we cannot give definitions, because the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.</a>
