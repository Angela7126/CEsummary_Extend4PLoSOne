<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>it enables generic tools to understand the data, and it enables people to understand the data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Indeed, there is an emerging trend to store a personal workspace (a MyDB) at the data center and deposit answers there.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As file systems grow to petabyte-scale archives with billions of files, the science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the data is to be analyzed by generic tools, the tools need to "understand" the data.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The cost of learning the tools (data definition and data loading, and query) doesn't seem worth it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They routinely allow the data to be replicated so that it can be organized in several ways (by time, by space, by other attributes).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So, it is paradoxical that the data management community has worked for 40 years to achieve something called data independence -- a clear separation of programs from data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If scientists are to read data collected by others, then the data must be carefully documented and must be published in forms that allow easy access and automated manipulation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>They have a schema language (metadata) to define the metadata.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>They have a few indexing strategies, and a simple data manipulation language.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The demand for tools and computational resources to perform scientific data-analysis is rising even faster than data volumes.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Once you can put your types and your programs inside the database you get the parallelism, non-procedural query, and data independence advantages of traditional database systems.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>They have the start of non-procedural and parallel programming.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>When a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers, then there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In this model, data analysis proceeds by searching all the relevant files -- opening each file, extracting the relevant data and then moving onto the next file.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Indeed, the files themselves may become irrelevant (they are just containers for data.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>So our focus here is on data exploration, interactive data analysis, and integration of Level 2 datasets.</a>
