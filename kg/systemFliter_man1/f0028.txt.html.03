<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>it enables generic tools to understand the data, and it enables people to understand the data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>one-disk-at-a-time and they do a brute-force search of the data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Separating the data and the metadata from the programs that manipulate the data is crucial to data independence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Indeed, there is an emerging trend to store a personal workspace (a MyDB) at the data center and deposit answers there.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The data avalanche is creating billions of files and trillions of events.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the NASA terminology, the raw Level 0 data is calibrated and rectified to Level 1 datasets that are combined with other data to make derived Level 2 datasets.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As file systems grow to petabyte-scale archives with billions of files, the science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The tools would do data mining and machine learning on the data, and would make it easy to script workflows that analyze the data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>We believe this database, file system, and programming language integration will be the key to managing and accessing peta-scale data management systems in the future.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While physical data independence is used to hide changes in the physical data organizations, logical data independence hides changes in the logical organization of the data.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>At a minimum, the file hierarchy will be replaced with a database that catalogs the attributes and lineage of each file.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The system uses a combination of Oracle to manage some of the file archive and also a physics-specific data analysis system called Root for data analysis .</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>For example, raw astronomy data is converted to object catalogs of stars and galaxies.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Each of these science centers curates one or more massive datasets, curates the applications that provide access to that dataset, and supports a staff that understands the data and indeed is constantly adding to and improving the dataset.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This article is about the data and data analysis layer within such a smart notebook.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>There is a convergence of file systems, database systems, and programming languages.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Much science data is in the form of numeric arrays generated by instruments and simulations.</a>
