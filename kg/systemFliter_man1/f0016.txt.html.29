<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>An advanced MYCIN might need to know that a patient won't take a bad tasting medicine unless he is convinced of its necessity.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Several artificial intelligence researchers, for example Marvin Minsky (1974) have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Perhaps if I knew more about bacterial diseases, I would conclude that their treatment sometimes really does require planning and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>A judge will side with me.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Some concluded that therefore logic is not an appropriate formalism.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>If you then learn that my car is being fixed (which does not contradict what you knew before), you no longer conclude that you can get a ride.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>If you now learn that the car will be out in half an hour you reverse yourself again.</a>
