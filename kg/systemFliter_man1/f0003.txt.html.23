<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Fig.12 compares the hyperlink, the semantic link, and the complex link.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Reasoning leads to the dependence between semantic links and the dependence between operations.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Time dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Firstly, individuals can only know a small part of the large-scale networks due to energy limitation and privacy.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Practice (e.g., dictation) helps establish the links between the behaviors through different channels and between behaviors and semantic images.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>In the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.</a>
