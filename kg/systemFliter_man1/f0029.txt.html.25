<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These convolutions will broaden the Dirac delta.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Two objects are said to match if they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>run1 is optical and run2 is radio or Xray), or O1 is a variable or transient object which varied below the detection threshold in run2, or O1 moved more than the classification distance between the two observations.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This might be caused by the object moving, or it might just be an unusually large position error, or they might just be different objects.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
