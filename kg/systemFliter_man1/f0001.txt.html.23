<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>According to the efficiency principle and regional principle, the radius of the network should be small.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The scale of summary can be regarded as a dimension.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(6) Enabling summarizers to know the background of representations, including technological, social and economic aspects.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>With the development of sciences, researchers are limited in time and energy to read more and more publications.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
