<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is analogous to a computer, which only obeys its programming language, but can be programmed such that one can communicate with it in a different programming language, or in English.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The design stance can usefully be applied to a thermostat -- it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to set it, no matter how it works.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Adopting this principle of rationality, we see that different machines have intellectual qualities to differing extents.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The example is extreme, because most people don't need the word 'think' to understand how a thermostatic control works.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did, because there are many ways of knowing that a dog wants to go out.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is useful because of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, it is not hard to make a program look at itself, and many AI programs do look at parts of themselves.</a>
