<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match) because this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When the objectID1-run2 pair is a miss, then objectID2 is zero, and the hitOrMiss flag suggests why (Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge)</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If this is an inexpensive test and if there are less than a thousand runs, then one can compute the overlapping run pairs by simply comparing all runs to all others.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Of the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge because the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For example, in Figure 2 object O1 matches O2 and O2 matches O3 but object O1 may not match O3.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
