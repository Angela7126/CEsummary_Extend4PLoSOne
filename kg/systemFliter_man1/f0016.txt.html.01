<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Circumscription allows us to make the known exceptions and to provide for additional exceptions to be added later -- again without changing existing statements.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, penguins, ostriches and birds with certain feathers removed can't fly.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We could try to provide axioms that will determine whether each kind of object can fly, but this would make the database very large.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This common sense physics is contiguous with scientific physics.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We will try to divide common sense capability into common sense knowledge and common sense reasoning, but even this cannot be made firm.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This much is often done by a simpler method -- the closed world assumption discussed by Raymond Reiter.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>of objects.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Consider the fact that when two objects collide they often make a noise.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>a specific bacterium, against a general rule and get a new fact about those objects.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Typically they match facts about specific objects, e.g.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Most expert systems, including MYCIN, never infer general statements, i.e.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Inventing a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events is a major unsolved problem of AI.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>This fact can be used to make a noise, to avoid making a noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of a noise.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>We shall discuss various areas of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>A production rule embodies a fact only as part of a specific procedure.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>It can also be used in specific situations involving a noise but also to understand general phenomena, e.g.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>A mathematical description of circumscription is beyond the scope of this lecture, but the general idea is straightforward.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Understanding common sense capability is now a hot area of research in artificial intelligence, but there is not yet any consensus.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>In other domains, expert systems and other AI programs have to make plans, but MYCIN doesn't.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>3) The world is extended in space and is occupied by objects that change their positions and are sometimes created and destroyed.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>The fact that MYCIN doesn't give a prognosis is certainly a limitation.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>A major difficulty is in handling the kind of partial knowledge people ordinarily have.</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>Namely, what one man builds as a reasoning method into his program, another can express as a fact using a richer ontology.</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>We have a property applicable to objects or a relation applicable to pairs or triplets, etc.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>Robert Filman did an interesting thesis on observation in a chess world where many facts that could be obtained by deduction are in fact obtained by observation.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>One such method is circumscription, described in (McCarthy 1980).</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Formalized nonmonotonic reasoning turns out to give certain rules of conjecture rather than rules of inference -- their conclusion are appropriate, but may be disconfirmed when more facts are obtained.</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>Then MYCIN might have to make a plan for getting rid of the patient's fever and verifying that it was gone as a part of the plan for using the antibiotic.</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>The situation with which MYCIN deals includes the doctor, the patient and the illness.</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>4) The ability to represent and use knowledge about knowledge is often required for intelligent behavior.</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>should an intruder step on the gravel, the dog will hear it and bark.</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>Much artificial intelligence inference is not designed to use directly the rules of inference of any of the well known systems of mathematical logic.</a>
