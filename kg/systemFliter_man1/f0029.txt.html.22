<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Having the Match table makes it easy to reason about the observations of the same object and easy to collect statistics (average, variance, ...</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is easy to compute the aggregate statistics for the bundle table once each match record has an assigned bundle ID.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This representation dovetails with the HTM library [1] that makes it easy to find all points within a region.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
