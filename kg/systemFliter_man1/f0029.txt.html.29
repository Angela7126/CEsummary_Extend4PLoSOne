<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When the objectID1-run2 pair is a miss, then objectID2 is zero, and the hitOrMiss flag suggests why (Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge)</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Edge:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ephemeral:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The residual misses are neither edge nor masked so they must be ephemeral.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Masked:</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Of the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge because the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Two objects are said to match if they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>about the object's position, magnitude, classification, the number and types of misses that the object experienced, and other attributes.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
