<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Scientists summarize their ideas as abstracts placed before the main texts in papers so that readers can quickly know the main idea before reading the main text.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different persons can make different summaries for the same text, and one person can generate different summaries for the same text at different times.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Humans can make a humanized summarization because they have experience and knowledge out of pictures.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The satisfied summaries of a representation vary with time.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As new pictures are continually added to the online systems, a good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.</a>
