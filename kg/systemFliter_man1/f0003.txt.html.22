<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Humans create the artifact space by designing the functions of artifacts, assigning semantic indicators to artifacts to reflect meaning or idea, and linking one another by direct or indirect referencing (e.g., paintings of the same author or times).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Reading hypertext has no big difference from reading text in paper although different front sizes and colors of words can be easily set to attract readers' attention.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Brain nets navigate with a kind of triangle-based grid cells [18], while humans often use distance space (e.g., using orthogonal latitude and longitude to locate surface objects on map) to locate objects in the physical space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The similar relation can be detected by analyzing the contents of nodes based on such approaches as the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and the Vector Space Model (VSM) [46] [62].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The linked data is to connect Web data based on URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>8 depicts the way to enrich SLN for detailed function modeling by making use of OOMD, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), in the background of interactions between multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Regarding class or object as node, the object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, method, roles, and functional modeling in OOMD support the specialization of SLN.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This implies an approach to improving the current research in many areas such as the semantic web, natural language processing, and text understanding by adding a little interaction.</a>
