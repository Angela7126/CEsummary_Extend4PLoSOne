<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Adding semantic nodes or links to SLN or removing them from SLN may have different influence on the network since different semantic nodes and links play different roles.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space so that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Semantic nodes can include rich contents so that an SLN is not only for machines to process but also for humans to operate, emerge semantic images and reasoning.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
