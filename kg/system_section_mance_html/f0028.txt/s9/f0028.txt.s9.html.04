<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This new generation of object relational database systems treats any data type (be it a native float, an array, a string, or a compound object like an XML or HTML document) as an encapsulated type that can be stored as a value in a field of a record.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This linking-embedding object model nicely accommodates the integration of database systems and file systems -- files are treated as linked-objects.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once you can put your types and your programs inside the database you get the parallelism, non-procedural query, and data independence advantages of traditional database systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This collection of problems is generally called the impedance mismatch -- meaning the mismatch between the programming model and the database capabilities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We believe this database, file system, and programming language integration will be the key to managing and accessing peta-scale data management systems in the future.</a>
