<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This linking-embedding object model nicely accommodates the integration of database systems and file systems -- files are treated as linked-objects.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>But, database systems are changing.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Indeed we expect HDF and other file formats to be added as types to most database systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Conventional tabular database systems are adequate for analyzing objects (galaxies, spectra, proteins, events, etc.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The impedance mismatch has made it difficult to map many science applications into conventional tabular database systems.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We believe this database, file system, and programming language integration will be the key to managing and accessing peta-scale data management systems in the future.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This collection of problems is generally called the impedance mismatch -- meaning the mismatch between the programming model and the database capabilities.</a>
