<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The impedance mismatch has made it difficult to map many science applications into conventional tabular database systems.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once you can put your types and your programs inside the database you get the parallelism, non-procedural query, and data independence advantages of traditional database systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Queries can read and write these extended types using the same techniques they use on native types.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>They are being integrated with programming languages so that they can support object-oriented databases.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Conventional tabular database systems are adequate for analyzing objects (galaxies, spectra, proteins, events, etc.</a>
