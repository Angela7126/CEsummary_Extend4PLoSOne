<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Traditional database systems have lagged in supporting core scientific data types but they have a few things scientists desperately need for their data analysis:</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>non-procedural query analysis, automatic parallelism, and sophisticated tools for associative, temporal, and spatial search.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Scientific colleagues give one or more of the following answers when asked why they do not use databases to manage their data:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Why are tabular databases so successful in commercial applications and such a flop in most scientific applications?</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The cost of learning the tools (data definition and data loading, and query) doesn't seem worth it.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>4) They do not support our data types (arrays, spatial, text, etc.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some scientists use databases for some of their work, but as a general rule, most scientists do not.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If one takes the controversial view that HDF, NetCDF, FITS, and Root are nascent database systems that provide metadata and portability but lack non-procedural query analysis, automatic parallelism, and sophisticated indexing, then one can see a fairly clear path that integrates these communities.</a>
