<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Using a database allows queries to define more sophisticated mesh partitions and allows concurrent indexed access to the simulation data for visualization and computational steering.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Finally, while we have focused on the ability of databases to simplify and speedup the production of raw simulation data, we cannot understate its core competency:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We have also had considerable success in adding user defined functions and stored procedures to astronomy databases.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These dumps are two to four orders of magnitude larger than the input mesh and represent a performance challenge in both traditional and database environments.</a>
