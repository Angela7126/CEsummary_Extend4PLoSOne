<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Each worker in the MPI job gets its partition from the database (as a query) and dumps its progress to the database.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The speedup is due to better indexing and parallelism.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>One of us has shown that the doing analysis atop a database system is vastly simpler and runs much faster than the corresponding file-oriented approach .</a>
