<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Because data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Good metadata becomes central for data sharing among different disciplines and for data analysis and visualization tools.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Science data centers with computational resources to explore huge data archives will be central to enabling such notebooks.</a>
