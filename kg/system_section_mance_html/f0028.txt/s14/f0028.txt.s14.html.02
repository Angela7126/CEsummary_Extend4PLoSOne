<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>which focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Science data centers with computational resources to explore huge data archives will be central to enabling such notebooks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) extensive metadata and metadata standards that will make it easy to discover what data exists, make it easy for people and programs to understand the data, and make it easy to track data lineage;</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A larger group of scientists are exploring these archives the way previous generations explored their private data.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The traditional systems have the virtues of automatic parallelism, indexing, and non-procedural access, but they need to embrace the data types of the science community and need to co-exist with data in file systems.</a>
