<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Good metadata becomes central for data sharing among different disciplines and for data analysis and visualization tools.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We believe the emphasis on extending database systems by unifying databases with programming languages so that one can either embed or link new object types into the data management system will enable this synthesis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Science data centers with computational resources to explore huge data archives will be central to enabling such notebooks.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>which focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The goal is a smart notebook that empowers scientists to explore the world's data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The traditional systems have the virtues of automatic parallelism, indexing, and non-procedural access, but they need to embrace the data types of the science community and need to co-exist with data in file systems.</a>
