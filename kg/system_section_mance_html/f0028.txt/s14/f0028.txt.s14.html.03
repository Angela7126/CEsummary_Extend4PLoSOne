<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>One group of scientists is collecting the data and managing these archives.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The goal is a smart notebook that empowers scientists to explore the world's data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The traditional systems have the virtues of automatic parallelism, indexing, and non-procedural access, but they need to embrace the data types of the science community and need to co-exist with data in file systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Science centers will provide both the archives and the institutional infrastructure to develop these peta-scale archives and the algorithms and tools to analyze them.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Consequently, science centers will remain the core vehicle and federations will likely be secondary.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Because data is so large, and IO bandwidth is not keeping pace, moving code to data will be essential to performance.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) extensive metadata and metadata standards that will make it easy to discover what data exists, make it easy for people and programs to understand the data, and make it easy to track data lineage;</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>which focus primarily on the metadata issues and data interchange, and the traditional data management systems (SQL and others) that have focused on managing and analyzing very large datasets.</a>
