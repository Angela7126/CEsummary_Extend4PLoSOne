<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Because data collection is now separated from data analysis, extensive metadata describing the data in standard terms is needed so people and programs can understand the data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One group of scientists is collecting the data and managing these archives.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Science centers will provide both the archives and the institutional infrastructure to develop these peta-scale archives and the algorithms and tools to analyze them.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A larger group of scientists are exploring these archives the way previous generations explored their private data.</a>
