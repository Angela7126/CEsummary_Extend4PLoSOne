<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Indeed, there is an emerging trend to store a personal workspace (a MyDB) at the data center and deposit answers there.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These personal workspaces are also a vehicle for data analysis groups to collaborate.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This minimizes data movement and allows collaboration among a group of scientists doing joint analysis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Such systems have to have a mechanism in place to protect against data loss, and provide availability even with a less than full configuration -- a self-healing system is required.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Peta-scale data sets will require 1000-10,000 disks and thousands of compute nodes.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>it enables generic tools to understand the data, and it enables people to understand the data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>When a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers, then there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Many scientists will prefer doing much of their analysis at data centers because it will save them having to manage local data and computer farms.</a>
