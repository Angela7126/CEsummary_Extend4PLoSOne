<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Longer term, personal workspaces at the data center could become a vehicle for data publication -- posting both the scientific results of an experiment or investigation along with the programs used to generate them in public read-only databases.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Within a data center one can combine redundancy with a clever partitioning strategy to protect against failure at the disk controller or server level.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Each of these science centers curates one or more massive datasets, curates the applications that provide access to that dataset, and supports a staff that understands the data and indeed is constantly adding to and improving the dataset.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Failed data can be automatically recovered from the redundant copies with no interruption to database access, much as RAID5 disk arrays do today.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Some scientists may bring the small data extracts "home" for local processing, analysis and visualization -- but it will be possible to do all the analysis at the data center using the personal workspace.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Increasingly, the datasets are so large, and the application programs are so complex, that it is much more economical to move the end-user's programs to the data and only communicate questions and answers rather than moving the source data and its applications to the user's local system.</a>
