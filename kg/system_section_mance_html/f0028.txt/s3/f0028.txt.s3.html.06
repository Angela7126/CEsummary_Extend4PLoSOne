<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Science data centers that provide access to both the data and the applications that analyze the data are emerging as service stations for one or another scientific domain.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Geographic replication provides both data availability and protects against data loss.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some scientists may bring the small data extracts "home" for local processing, analysis and visualization -- but it will be possible to do all the analysis at the data center using the personal workspace.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>These personal workspaces are also a vehicle for data analysis groups to collaborate.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>All these scenarios postulate easy data access, interchange and integration.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Many scientists will prefer doing much of their analysis at data centers because it will save them having to manage local data and computer farms.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Longer term, personal workspaces at the data center could become a vehicle for data publication -- posting both the scientific results of an experiment or investigation along with the programs used to generate them in public read-only databases.</a>
