<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Geographic replication provides both data availability and protects against data loss.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Within a data center one can combine redundancy with a clever partitioning strategy to protect against failure at the disk controller or server level.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Peta-scale data sets will require 1000-10,000 disks and thousands of compute nodes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Replicating the data in science centers at different geographic locations is implied in the discussion above.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Science data centers that provide access to both the data and the applications that analyze the data are emerging as service stations for one or another scientific domain.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Failed data can be automatically recovered from the redundant copies with no interruption to database access, much as RAID5 disk arrays do today.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Such systems have to have a mechanism in place to protect against data loss, and provide availability even with a less than full configuration -- a self-healing system is required.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These personal workspaces are also a vehicle for data analysis groups to collaborate.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
