<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Each of these science centers curates one or more massive datasets, curates the applications that provide access to that dataset, and supports a staff that understands the data and indeed is constantly adding to and improving the dataset.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Indeed, there is an emerging trend to store a personal workspace (a MyDB) at the data center and deposit answers there.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Science data centers that provide access to both the data and the applications that analyze the data are emerging as service stations for one or another scientific domain.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>When a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers, then there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Some scientists may bring the small data extracts "home" for local processing, analysis and visualization -- but it will be possible to do all the analysis at the data center using the personal workspace.</a>
