<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Science data centers that provide access to both the data and the applications that analyze the data are emerging as service stations for one or another scientific domain.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If this is common, the two data centers will likely federate with one another to provide mutual data backup since the data traffic will justify making the copy.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When a scientist wants to correlate data from two different data centers, then there is no option but to move part of the data from one place to another.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Increasingly, the datasets are so large, and the application programs are so complex, that it is much more economical to move the end-user's programs to the data and only communicate questions and answers rather than moving the source data and its applications to the user's local system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The new work style in these scientific domains is to send questions to applications running at a data center and get back answers, rather than to bulk-copy raw data from the archive to your local server for further analysis.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Some scientists may bring the small data extracts "home" for local processing, analysis and visualization -- but it will be possible to do all the analysis at the data center using the personal workspace.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Longer term, personal workspaces at the data center could become a vehicle for data publication -- posting both the scientific results of an experiment or investigation along with the programs used to generate them in public read-only databases.</a>
