<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Database systems provide two forms of data independence termed physical data independence and logical data independence.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While physical data independence is used to hide changes in the physical data organizations, logical data independence hides changes in the logical organization of the data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But the key point of this section is that an explicit and standard data access layer with precise metadata and explicit data access is essential for data independence.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Modern database systems also provide logical data independence that insulates programs from changes to the logical database design -- allowing designers to add or delete relationships and to add information to the database.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One example of physical data independence is the ability of a database system to partition the rows of a table across multiple disks and/or multiple nodes of a cluster without requiring that any application programs be modified.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the scientific domain the analogy would be that you could take a working application program that uses a C struct to describe its data records on disk and change the physical layout of the records without having to rewrite or even recompile the application program (or any of the other application programs that access the same data).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Separating the data and the metadata from the programs that manipulate the data is crucial to data independence.</a>
