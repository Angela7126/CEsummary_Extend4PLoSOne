<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Views serve many purposes including increased security (by hiding attributes from applications and/or users without a legitimate need for access) and enhanced performance (by materializing views defined by complex SQL queries over very large input tables).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Modern database systems also provide logical data independence that insulates programs from changes to the logical database design -- allowing designers to add or delete relationships and to add information to the database.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The schema for a database holds all metadata including table and view definitions as well as information on what indices exist and how tables are mapped to storage volumes (and nodes in a parallel database environment).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One example of physical data independence is the ability of a database system to partition the rows of a table across multiple disks and/or multiple nodes of a cluster without requiring that any application programs be modified.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Views are used to solve these problems by dynamically translating data to the appropriate formats (converting among character and number representations, converting among 6-digit and 9-digit postal codes, converting between long-and-short names, and hiding new information from old programs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Data classes encapsulated with methods provide data independence and make it much easier to evolve the data without perturbing programs.</a>
