<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Separating the data and the metadata from the programs that manipulate the data is crucial to data independence.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>While physical data independence is used to hide changes in the physical data organizations, logical data independence hides changes in the logical organization of the data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One example of physical data independence is the ability of a database system to partition the rows of a table across multiple disks and/or multiple nodes of a cluster without requiring that any application programs be modified.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, it is paradoxical that the data management community has worked for 40 years to achieve something called data independence -- a clear separation of programs from data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Database systems use a schema to implement both logical and physical data independence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The mapping of the fields of each row of a relational table to different disks is another important example of physical data independence.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, in all cases the goal is to be able to change the underlying physical data organization without breaking any application programs that depend on the old data format.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Modern database systems also provide logical data independence that insulates programs from changes to the logical database design -- allowing designers to add or delete relationships and to add information to the database.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The separation of data and programs is artificial -- one cannot see the data without using a program and most programs are data driven.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is important to be able to make these changes without breaking the millions of lines of existing programs that want to see the data in the old way.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Database systems provide two forms of data independence termed physical data independence and logical data independence.</a>
