<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Analyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies requires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects -- finding both needles in the haystack and finding very small haystacks that were undetected in previous measurements.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We argue that the smart notebook will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The real challenge is building this smart notebook that unlocks the data and makes it easy to capture, organize, analyze, visualize, and publish.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Scientific instruments and computer simulations are creating vast data stores that require new scientific methods to analyze and organize the data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The raw instrument and simulation data is processed by pipelines that produce standard data products.</a>
