<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>one could focus on the science rather than needing to be an information-technology-professional with expertise in arcane computer data analysis tools.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We believe that most new science happens when the data is examined in new ways.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since these new instruments have extraordinary precision, the data quality is also rapidly improving.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Analyzing this data to find the subtle effects missed by previous studies requires algorithms that can simultaneously deal with huge datasets and that can find very subtle effects -- finding both needles in the haystack and finding very small haystacks that were undetected in previous measurements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Things were simpler then;</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In the NASA terminology, the raw Level 0 data is calibrated and rectified to Level 1 datasets that are combined with other data to make derived Level 2 datasets.</a>
