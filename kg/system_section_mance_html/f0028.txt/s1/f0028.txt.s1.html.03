<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The largest data analysis gap is in this man-machine interface.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We argue that the smart notebook will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We believe that most new science happens when the data is examined in new ways.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The real challenge is building this smart notebook that unlocks the data and makes it easy to capture, organize, analyze, visualize, and publish.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Many scientists envy the pen-and-paper days when all their data used to fit in a notebook and analysis was done with a slide-rule.</a>
