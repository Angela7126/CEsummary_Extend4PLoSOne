<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In the NASA terminology, the raw Level 0 data is calibrated and rectified to Level 1 datasets that are combined with other data to make derived Level 2 datasets.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So our focus here is on data exploration, interactive data analysis, and integration of Level 2 datasets.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We argue that the smart notebook will access data presented by science centers that will provide the community with analysis tools and computational resources to explore huge data archives.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Data analysis tools have not kept pace with our ability to capture and store data.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Scientific instruments and computer simulations are creating vast data stores that require new scientific methods to analyze and organize the data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The raw instrument and simulation data is processed by pipelines that produce standard data products.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This article is about the data and data analysis layer within such a smart notebook.</a>
