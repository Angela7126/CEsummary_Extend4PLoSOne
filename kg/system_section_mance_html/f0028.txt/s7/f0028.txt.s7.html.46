<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As file systems grow to petabyte-scale archives with billions of files, the science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Set-oriented file processing will make file names increasingly irrelevant -- analysis will be applied to "all data with these attributes" rather than working on a list of file/directory names or name patterns.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Indeed, the files themselves may become irrelevant (they are just containers for data.</a>
