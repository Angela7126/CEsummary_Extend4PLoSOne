<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this model, data analysis proceeds by searching all the relevant files -- opening each file, extracting the relevant data and then moving onto the next file.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The data avalanche is creating billions of files and trillions of events.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This Fortran/C/Java/Python file-at-a-time procedural data analysis is nearing the breaking point.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The file-oriented approach postulates that files are organized into directories.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Scientists need a way (1) to use intelligent indices and data organizations to subset the search, (2) to use parallel processing and data access to search huge datasets within seconds, and (3) to have powerful analysis tools that they can apply to the subset of data being analyzed.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When all the relevant data has been gathered in memory (or in intermediate files) the program can begin its analysis.</a>
