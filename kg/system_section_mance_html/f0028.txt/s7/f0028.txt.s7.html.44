<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this model, data analysis proceeds by searching all the relevant files -- opening each file, extracting the relevant data and then moving onto the next file.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Performing this filter-then-analyze, data analysis on large datasets with conventional procedural tools runs slower and slower as data volumes increase.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As file systems grow to petabyte-scale archives with billions of files, the science community must create a synthesis of database systems and file systems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Set-oriented file processing will make file names increasingly irrelevant -- analysis will be applied to "all data with these attributes" rather than working on a list of file/directory names or name patterns.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Indeed, the files themselves may become irrelevant (they are just containers for data.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Scientists need a way (1) to use intelligent indices and data organizations to subset the search, (2) to use parallel processing and data access to search huge datasets within seconds, and (3) to have powerful analysis tools that they can apply to the subset of data being analyzed.</a>
