<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Many analysis algorithms are super-linear, often needing N2 or N3 time to process N data points.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the last decade, while capacity has grown more than 100-fold, storage bandwidth has improved only about 10-fold.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>algorithmic intensity, nonlinearity, and bandwidth-limits mean that the analysis is taking longer and longer.</a>
