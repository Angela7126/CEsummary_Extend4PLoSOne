<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) More sophisticated algorithms consume more instructions to analyze each byte.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>And (3) IO bandwidth has not kept pace with storage capacity.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The demand for tools and computational resources to perform scientific data-analysis is rising even faster than data volumes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>To ameliorate these problems, scientists will need better analysis algorithms that can handle extremely large datasets with approximate algorithms (ones with near-linear execution time) and they will need parallel algorithms that can apply many processors and many disks to the problem to meet cpu-density and bandwidth-density demands.</a>
