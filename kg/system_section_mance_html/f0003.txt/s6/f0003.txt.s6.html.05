<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Cyber semantic images reflecting the mental space and the complex space can be effectively preserved and accessed when individuals emerge questions, find answers, and select appropriate individuals to collaborate.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The stimulus-response mechanism links the physical space and the socio space to the mental space through the physiological space and the psychological space.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
