<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Linking a new semantic image to an existing semantic image, feeding back physical, psychological, physiological, and socio effect, and remembering the links between the macro processes and the effects.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Individual mental space keeps emerging and evolving semantic images with lifetime learning and continuous socio interactions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Selecting the situation for reflection according to the active points in the mental space reflecting the physical, physiological, psychological, and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Photos are direct mappings from one physical object into another (film or digital memory) while paintings are externalization of semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is in line with the opinion that human brain develops its neural connections and nerve cells through continuous learning.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The process of painting concerns the process of experiencing, emerging, reasoning, evolving and externalizing semantic images.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The basic classification and linking mechanism in the mental space could be inherited and fused through learning, experiencing and influencing between individuals.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Reading can be regarded as a process of emerging semantic images with sensing the flow of language units in texts.</a>
