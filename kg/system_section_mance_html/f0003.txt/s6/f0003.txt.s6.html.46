<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because the semantic images in their minds are different.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Even for the author, different semantic images may emerge when sensing his/her artifact at different times, because semantic images in the author's mind keep evolving with experience.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Points can cooperate with each other for rendering and remembering semantic images as well as for generating and operating flows through semantic links.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The mental space can adapt its structure with continuously emerging semantic images and complex reasoning.</a>
