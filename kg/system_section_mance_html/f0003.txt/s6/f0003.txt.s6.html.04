<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Cyber semantic images reflecting the mental space and the complex space can be effectively preserved and accessed when individuals emerge questions, find answers, and select appropriate individuals to collaborate.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Even for the author, different semantic images may emerge when sensing his/her artifact at different times, because semantic images in the author's mind keep evolving with experience.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Mapping a situation or a sequence of situations in the physical space or socio space into the mental space as a semantic image ?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Imagination is the ability and process of linking one semantic image to the other, or significantly extending semantic images by complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(10) Linking one point to another point, linking one semantic image to another semantic image, and emerging effect from reasoning within limited time scale.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Points can cooperate with each other for rendering and remembering semantic images as well as for generating and operating flows through semantic links.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Linking a new semantic image to an existing semantic image, feeding back physical, psychological, physiological, and socio effect, and remembering the links between the macro processes and the effects.</a>
