<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because the semantic images in their minds are different.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Asking a group of students to draw paintings independently according to the same story, the paintings drawn by different students are different.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In contrast, any machine will output the same thing if it inputs the same thing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Even for the author, different semantic images may emerge when sensing his/her artifact at different times, because semantic images in the author's mind keep evolving with experience.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Points can cooperate with each other for rendering and remembering semantic images as well as for generating and operating flows through semantic links.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Cyber semantic images reflecting the mental space and the complex space can be effectively preserved and accessed when individuals emerge questions, find answers, and select appropriate individuals to collaborate.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Linking a new semantic image to an existing semantic image, feeding back physical, psychological, physiological, and socio effect, and remembering the links between the macro processes and the effects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Individual mental space keeps emerging and evolving semantic images with lifetime learning and continuous socio interactions.</a>
