<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The behaviors in one space can be extended to multiple spaces and be reflected in the other spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Individuals can zoom in the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space while co-experiencing.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is important to discover the implicit links between various symmetry and self-similarity in different spaces.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A falling apple in the physical space will be sensed and linked to different semantic layers, which inspires relevant reasoning in the cyber space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Exploring the symmetry and self-similarity in various spaces is an approach to understand the intrinsic principles in these spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>To create an adaptive model enables the cyber space to reflect the other spaces as depicted in Fig.5.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, the cyber space search can be extended to the socio space search, to the physical space search, to the artifact space search, and even to the physiological space search (for medical applications).</a>
