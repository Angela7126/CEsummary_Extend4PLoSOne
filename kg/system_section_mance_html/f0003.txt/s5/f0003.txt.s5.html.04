<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The phenomenon of a falling apple leaves semantic images at the reflection layer through sensors, at the commonsense layer (e.g., the concept "apple is fruit, fruit is food"), at the concept layer (e.g., physical concepts force f, the mass of an object m, acceleration a, and gravity), at the rule layer (e.g., rule of multiplication), at the method layer (e.g., the multiplication operation), at the principle layer (e.g., f=m?a), at the theory layer (e.g., physics), and at the semantic worldview layer (e.g., number of apples, external existence).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, the cyber space search can be extended to the socio space search, to the physical space search, to the artifact space search, and even to the physiological space search (for medical applications).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A falling apple in the physical space will be sensed and linked to different semantic layers, which inspires relevant reasoning in the cyber space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
