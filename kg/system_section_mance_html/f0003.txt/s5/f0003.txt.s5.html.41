<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different spaces have different types of distance, for example, friendship between individuals, the difference between interests, and the distance between offices.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Reflecting different aspects of the objects needs to use the distances in different spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Time, place, event, and individual will be linked when seeking the answer to the question about who, what, where, why, when, and how.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individuals can zoom in the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space while co-experiencing.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A falling apple in the physical space will be sensed and linked to different semantic layers, which inspires relevant reasoning in the cyber space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The triangle reasoning and navigation on the semantic link networks will be coordinated with the orthogonal locating in the multi-dimensional classification space in the mental space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, the cyber space search can be extended to the socio space search, to the physical space search, to the artifact space search, and even to the physiological space search (for medical applications).</a>
