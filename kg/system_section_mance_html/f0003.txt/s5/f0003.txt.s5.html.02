<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A falling apple in the physical space will be sensed and linked to different semantic layers, which inspires relevant reasoning in the cyber space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The phenomenon of a falling apple leaves semantic images at the reflection layer through sensors, at the commonsense layer (e.g., the concept "apple is fruit, fruit is food"), at the concept layer (e.g., physical concepts force f, the mass of an object m, acceleration a, and gravity), at the rule layer (e.g., rule of multiplication), at the method layer (e.g., the multiplication operation), at the principle layer (e.g., f=m?a), at the theory layer (e.g., physics), and at the semantic worldview layer (e.g., number of apples, external existence).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The triangle reasoning and navigation on the semantic link networks will be coordinated with the orthogonal locating in the multi-dimensional classification space in the mental space.</a>
