<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Individuals can zoom in the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space while co-experiencing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A falling apple in the physical space will be sensed and linked to different semantic layers, which inspires relevant reasoning in the cyber space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Linking spaces enables spaces to reflect one another while individuals co-experience in these spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, the cyber space search can be extended to the socio space search, to the physical space search, to the artifact space search, and even to the physiological space search (for medical applications).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>To create an adaptive model enables the cyber space to reflect the other spaces as depicted in Fig.5.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>At the same time, the cyber space can reflect the experiences and collect relevant real-time interaction from multiple spaces through various sensors.</a>
