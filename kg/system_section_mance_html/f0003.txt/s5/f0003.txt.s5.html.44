<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The socio space and the mental space cooperatively create, evolve and reflect the cyber space in real time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This enables the mental space to reflect more of the other spaces and enables the cyber space to support the complex space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>6 depicts how machine intelligence and human intelligence are extended in the complex space through reflecting, experiencing, linking, classifying, searching, navigating, locating, reasoning, interacting, influencing, and zooming in multiple spaces at multiple semantic levels.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different spaces have different types of distance, for example, friendship between individuals, the difference between interests, and the distance between offices.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Reflecting different aspects of the objects needs to use the distances in different spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Time, place, event, and individual will be linked when seeking the answer to the question about who, what, where, why, when, and how.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The phenomenon of a falling apple leaves semantic images at the reflection layer through sensors, at the commonsense layer (e.g., the concept "apple is fruit, fruit is food"), at the concept layer (e.g., physical concepts force f, the mass of an object m, acceleration a, and gravity), at the rule layer (e.g., rule of multiplication), at the method layer (e.g., the multiplication operation), at the principle layer (e.g., f=m?a), at the theory layer (e.g., physics), and at the semantic worldview layer (e.g., number of apples, external existence).</a>
