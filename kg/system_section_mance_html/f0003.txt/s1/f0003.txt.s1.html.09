<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The cyber-physical-socio space is the fusion of the physical space, the cyber space, and the socio space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Efforts have been made to link the cyber space to the physical space and the social space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Various links pervade the physical space, society, and cyber space, giving the structure and function to a variety of resources and behaviors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Fig.1 (b) depicts the extension from the cyber space to the physical space through various sensors.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Harmonious development of the physical space, society, and cyber space becomes more and more important.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The future interconnection environment was regarded as a large-scale human-machine environment that unites the nature, society and cyber space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Users can also change physical objects in the physical space, which can also be fed back into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Evolution from the cyber space to the cyber-physical-socio space is depicted in Fig.1.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Sensors are limited in ability to collect all information in the physical space, so users still need to directly collect the significant information in the physical space and then put them into the cyber space after analysis (including experiment).</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Web of things can be regarded as a kind of cyber-physical space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>one only allows users to read information in the cyber space like the Web, and the other allow users to read and write information in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The environment will be an autonomous, living, sustainable, and intelligent system in which the society and physical space evolve cooperatively.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Fig.1 (a) depicts two types of the cyber space:</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Some characteristics will be lost when things are transformed into the cyber space through various sensors.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Space stations and shuttles are advanced cyber-physical systems.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Since then, scientists have been pursuing an ideal cyber space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Users' status, interests and knowledge evolve with interacting with each other and operating the cyber space.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Hyperlinks and previous typed links are created for structuring the cyber space.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>He raised a new aim of enhancing the cyber space.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The situated or grounded issues have been studied, for example, how to linking language to the physical space [34].</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Both rely on humans to add information to the cyber space for sharing with others.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Not only individual's behaviors but also socio interactions can be fed back into the cyber space for further processing.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Fig.1 (d) depicts a simple cyber-physical-socio space.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Improving socio interaction will help establish a knowledge society by supporting socio activities at multiple levels (e.g., the physical level and the mental level) and in different spaces.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>From perspective of multiple disciplines, this paper explores the methodology of semantic linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence under the background of developing a complex space?</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>This enables the cyber space to adapt services according to the feedback since behavior change may indicate some psychological change.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Schemas serve as structured beliefs that are grounded in an agent's physical environment through a causal-predictive cycle of action and perception.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>The ideal of a harmoniously evolved interconnection environment Eco-Grid was proposed from the ecosystem point of view:</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Semantics is fundamental in artificial intelligence, computer science, and future interconnection environment.</a>
