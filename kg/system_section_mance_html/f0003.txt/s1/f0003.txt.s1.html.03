<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Various links pervade the physical space, society, and cyber space, giving the structure and function to a variety of resources and behaviors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A set of parameters of the environment was proposed in [79].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The notions of semantic worldview, interactive semantic base, semantic image, and semantic lens were proposed in [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Although the typed hyperlink was called semantic link sometimes[25], the semantics of semantic link and the laws of linking are ignored.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Natural semantics is the structure and laws of the nature.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Harmonious development of the physical space, society, and cyber space becomes more and more important.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The interactive semantics emphasizes the importance of interaction in forming, understanding and evolving semantics.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Commonsense is the basis of representing and understanding semantics.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To unveil the principle of mind and the interaction among minds is a grand challenge.</a>

<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Social semantics is the explanation, indication, or metaphor of natural and socio existence.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Efforts have been made to link the cyber space to the physical space and the social space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Relevant works include the Web/Internet of Things [30] and the cyber-physical systems.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The Web/Internet of things is to link things to the Web/Internet through devices.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(2) To explore the laws of semantic linking.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>It is important to explore the semantics of different categories by using different approaches [59].</a>

<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>one only allows users to read information in the cyber space like the Web, and the other allow users to read and write information in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Previous links are too simple to represent rich socio relations, and various link structures cannot reflect the semantics of real socio networks.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The key is to establish and maintain the semantic links between peers according to their schemas, and to develop routing strategies that can make use of the links.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Various data structures like the linked list and tree can be regarded as a kind of link on data or data types for machine processing rather than for human to read [85].</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>a database of nonlinear text, view filters for selecting information from the database, and views that structure the display of information for the terminal.</a>

<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Much research has shown the feasibility of establishing links between language units (e.g., a limited set of words) and brain signals [5][22][40].</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Exploring the uniformity and diversity in the complex environment will be a challenge.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>The future interconnection environment was regarded as a large-scale human-machine environment that unites the nature, society and cyber space.</a>
