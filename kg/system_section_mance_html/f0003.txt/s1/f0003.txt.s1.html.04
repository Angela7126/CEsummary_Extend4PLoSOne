<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Although the typed hyperlink was called semantic link sometimes[25], the semantics of semantic link and the laws of linking are ignored.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Semantic Web research has formed a research community, although there are some different opinions [45], for example, the logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of relevant phenomena related to semantics, and RDF is similar to SN and the classic conceptual modeling approaches such as entity-relation model and class diagrams in the object-oriented modeling.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>the replacement link for replacing the texts in the current window, the note link for displaying text in a pop-up window, and the reference link for bringing up a new window with the destination text [7].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The notions of semantic worldview, interactive semantic base, semantic image, and semantic lens were proposed in [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>the reference link for cross-referring, the summarization link for summarizing, the supersede link for versioning, and the precede link for ordering.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Assigning semantic indicators and rules to links enables some implicit links to be derived and some semantics to emerge with network motion [87][90].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Trigg described the Textnet system as supporting nonlinear text-text where documents are organized as primitive pieces of text connected with typed links to form a network similar to the semantic net.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Previous links are too simple to represent rich socio relations, and various link structures cannot reflect the semantics of real socio networks.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The typed link in the hypertext system is a link between documents or parts of document that includes information about the character of the link.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Various data structures like the linked list and tree can be regarded as a kind of link on data or data types for machine processing rather than for human to read [85].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The problems are whether brain signals are enough to reflect the rich semantics of various socio interactions and events, whether the mappings between brain signals and larger language units like the description of a story can be established, and whether the mappings between the traces of brain signals and the thinking processes can be established.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Sensors are limited in ability to collect all information in the physical space, so users still need to directly collect the significant information in the physical space and then put them into the cyber space after analysis (including experiment).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A set of semantic links such as implication, subtype, cause-effect and reference as well as a set of reasoning rules were suggested [77].</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>In 1945, Vannevar Bush introduced the ideal of memex, which could browse and make notes in an extensive on-line text and graphical system, and contain a very large library, personal notes, photographs and sketches, and several screens and a facility for establishing a labeled link between any two points in the entire library [8].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The similar relation can be detected by analyzing the contents of nodes based on such approaches as the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and the Vector Space Model (VSM) [46] [62].</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(1) To support intelligent applications by assigning semantic indicators and rules to links and enabling relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Some links between brain function and language have been found, e.g., Wernicke's area is more related to high-level understanding of language, and the facial motor cortex is related to the control of facial muscles that help produce sounds.</a>
