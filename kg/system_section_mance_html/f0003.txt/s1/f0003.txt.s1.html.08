<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Efforts have been made to link the cyber space to the physical space and the social space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The cyber-physical-socio space is the fusion of the physical space, the cyber space, and the socio space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Various links pervade the physical space, society, and cyber space, giving the structure and function to a variety of resources and behaviors.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Harmonious development of the physical space, society, and cyber space becomes more and more important.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Although the typed hyperlink was called semantic link sometimes[25], the semantics of semantic link and the laws of linking are ignored.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>one only allows users to read information in the cyber space like the Web, and the other allow users to read and write information in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>SLN can have schemas to regulate its semantics by specifying node types, link types, and reasoning rules [88].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Fig.1 (b) depicts the extension from the cyber space to the physical space through various sensors.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The future interconnection environment was regarded as a large-scale human-machine environment that unites the nature, society and cyber space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Sensors are limited in ability to collect all information in the physical space, so users still need to directly collect the significant information in the physical space and then put them into the cyber space after analysis (including experiment).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Fig.1 (a) depicts two types of the cyber space:</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Resources and semantic link instances are regulated by their types.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Users can also change physical objects in the physical space, which can also be fed back into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Hyperlinks and previous typed links are created for structuring the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Evolution from the cyber space to the cyber-physical-socio space is depicted in Fig.1.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Previous links are too simple to represent rich socio relations, and various link structures cannot reflect the semantics of real socio networks.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Semantics is classified into natural semantics and social semantics.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The environment will be an autonomous, living, sustainable, and intelligent system in which the society and physical space evolve cooperatively.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The typed link in the hypertext system is a link between documents or parts of document that includes information about the character of the link.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>An approach to automatically determining semantic links is to integrate statistical approaches and various reasoning mechanisms.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The notions of semantic worldview, interactive semantic base, semantic image, and semantic lens were proposed in [89].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Natural semantics is the structure and laws of the nature.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The interactive semantics emphasizes the importance of interaction in forming, understanding and evolving semantics.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>A global SLN schema reflects consensus on indicating the basic semantics of the domain.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Web of things can be regarded as a kind of cyber-physical space.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Commonsense is the basis of representing and understanding semantics.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Both rely on humans to add information to the cyber space for sharing with others.</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>Assigning semantic indicators and rules to links enables some implicit links to be derived and some semantics to emerge with network motion [87][90].</a>
