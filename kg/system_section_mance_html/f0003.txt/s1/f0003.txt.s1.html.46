<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some significant information in the physical space can be automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Fig.1 (b) depicts the extension from the cyber space to the physical space through various sensors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Sensors are limited in ability to collect all information in the physical space, so users still need to directly collect the significant information in the physical space and then put them into the cyber space after analysis (including experiment).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The linked data is to connect Web data based on URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The similar relation can be detected by analyzing the contents of nodes based on such approaches as the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and the Vector Space Model (VSM) [46] [62].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This enables the cyber space to adapt services according to the feedback since behavior change may indicate some psychological change.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Once things are linked to the Web through the current Web/Internet standards, things will become a part of Web/Internet.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Generally, data mining is to find the implicit link in large closed data set by using statistical method [31].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The motivation is to integrate the hypertext browsing with information retrieval.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) To support intelligent applications by assigning semantic indicators and rules to links and enabling relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Users can define SLN instances by instantiating the global schema, or defining a sub-schema first and then instantiating the sub-schema.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Improving socio interaction will help establish a knowledge society by supporting socio activities at multiple levels (e.g., the physical level and the mental level) and in different spaces.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>An important issue is how to automatically generate a schema from a set of SLN instances.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>This concerns the classification on students' behaviors (including micro expressions) and carrying out real-time analysis and adaptation.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Different from the schemas of databases, the self-organized SLN needs an adaptable schema that meets the need of changes because the clusters and links may need adapting when new instances are continuously generated.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>So, Web/Internet of Things can be regarded as an application of Web/Internet.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>An object-oriented SLN language was suggested to implement the SLN [66].</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Assigning semantic indicators and rules to links enables some implicit links to be derived and some semantics to emerge with network motion [87][90].</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Link structure was analyzed and used to improve web information retrieval [42][57].</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>The invention of telegraphy and telephone realizes real-time interaction cross regions for the first time in human history.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Effort has been made to detect whether people are telling the truth by analyzing magnetic-resonance images (MRI) [32].</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Using paranomes, one can coordinate the use of these multiple representations.</a>
