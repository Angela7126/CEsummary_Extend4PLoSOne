<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Semantic Web research has formed a research community, although there are some different opinions [45], for example, the logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of relevant phenomena related to semantics, and RDF is similar to SN and the classic conceptual modeling approaches such as entity-relation model and class diagrams in the object-oriented modeling.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In 1945, Vannevar Bush introduced the ideal of memex, which could browse and make notes in an extensive on-line text and graphical system, and contain a very large library, personal notes, photographs and sketches, and several screens and a facility for establishing a labeled link between any two points in the entire library [8].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It provides a computational path from sensing and motor action to words and speech acts by combing concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Trigg described the Textnet system as supporting nonlinear text-text where documents are organized as primitive pieces of text connected with typed links to form a network similar to the semantic net.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Experiments have demonstrated that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation to a certain extent [9].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The associate mechanism polynemes invoke partial states of agents for representing some different aspects of a thing's meaning, e.g., recognizing an apple arouses its properties and relevant experience.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>linked and windowing texts can be stored and retrieved, documents can have windows to other documents, the evolving corpus is continually expandable without fundamental change, and, new links and windows can continually add new access pathways to old materials.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Reading hypertext has no big difference from reading text in paper although different front sizes and colors of words can be easily set to attract readers' attention.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The similar relation can be detected by analyzing the contents of nodes based on such approaches as the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and the Vector Space Model (VSM) [46] [62].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The linked data is to connect Web data based on URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Improving socio interaction will help establish a knowledge society by supporting socio activities at multiple levels (e.g., the physical level and the mental level) and in different spaces.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Modern airplanes can sense and record flying data such as location, height, temperature, and fuel, have communication ability, and can even autopilot according to pre-designed program.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Can links semantically pass through spaces (e.g., physiological space, psychological space, and mental space) to extend machine intelligence and human intelligence?</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Efforts have been made to create large commonsense base in the cyber space, for example, the Cyc project (started in 1984) and the Open Mind Common Sense project (started in 1999).</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(1) To support intelligent applications by assigning semantic indicators and rules to links and enabling relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
