<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Secondly, to minimize energy, behaviors need to be localized.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The psychological space interacts with the mental space, the physiological space, and the socio space to regulate behaviors when humans co-experience in the physical space and socio space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In addition to the reflection through the cyber space and artifact space, direct reflection from the physical space and the socio space are important to establish the right semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There is a gap between the external existence in the physical space and socio space and the internal existence in the mental space (the semantic images).</a>
