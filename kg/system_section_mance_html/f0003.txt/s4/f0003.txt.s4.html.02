<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Symbols and the composition of symbols according to symbol rules instruct execution of machines and indicate semantic images in the mental space accompanying reading and writing behaviors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Interactions involve in motion in the physical space, computing and communicating in the cyber space, behaviors in the psychological space, socio space, and physiological space, and various flows that change the statuses of individuals.</a>
