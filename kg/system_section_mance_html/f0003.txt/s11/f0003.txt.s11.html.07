<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An interactive co-computing environment model incorporating machine computing, human reasoning and socio interaction is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The CP3SME concerns not only machine intelligence, human intelligence and social intelligence as emphasized in the interactive semantics but also the closed loops in the environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In addition, a harmonious human-machine interactive interface is an important aspect of integrating machine intelligence, human intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The interactive environment operates for ensuring harmonious development of individuals and the environment.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) Interaction requirements are raised in the physiological space, psychological space, socio space, and mental spaces from time to time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A fundamental difference between machine and human is that humans can co-experience in multiple spaces and emerge semantic images and motivations according to psychological, physiological and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is important for ensuring effective interaction since interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The cyber semantic image plays an important role in supporting effective interaction.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>and, the principles, laws and methods of interaction, influence, reasoning and explanation in the complex space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Individuals in different spaces evolve with the development of the environment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the CP3SME, co-experiencing in multiple spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of various links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning are the basis of the cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
