<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The CP3SME needs a reflexive, self-organized, and adaptive architecture that can preserve semantic images of itself and versatile individuals in lifetime and manage significant behaviours, events and processes (e.g., in daily life, learning, creation and business).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the CP3SME, co-experiencing in multiple spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of various links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning are the basis of the cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The architecture links socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as physiological, psychological and mental statuses to create a complex intelligent environment for well-being.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An interactive co-computing environment model incorporating machine computing, human reasoning and socio interaction is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A fundamental difference between machine and human is that humans can co-experience in multiple spaces and emerge semantic images and motivations according to psychological, physiological and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Traditional intelligent systems rely on humans to define a problem, and then design a computing process to solve the problem by machine languages.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(3) Minds reflect forms, emerge or enrich semantic images, generate motivation, and carry out reasoning.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The cyber semantic image plays an important role in supporting effective interaction.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In contrast, humans continually receive input from the environment and adjust behaviors when thinking and behaving.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In addition, a harmonious human-machine interactive interface is an important aspect of integrating machine intelligence, human intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
