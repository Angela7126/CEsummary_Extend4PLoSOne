<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An idea will be linked to sketch, to design, to the production processes, and further to the closed loops in the environment.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This concerns the modelling of the spaces, the mapping between spaces, the mechanism of influence, and the rules of linking and flows through links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The CP3SME is an open system since machines may be linked to existing machines from time to time or disconnected the current links according to the real-time requirement and rules in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is important for ensuring effective interaction since interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(5) The cyber space builds cyber semantic images during direct and indirect interactions so that it knows the past and present interactions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Turing machine is a closed system as its computing components and computing process is pre-defined and fixed, which cannot be changed by input and output.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The interactive environment operates for ensuring harmonious development of individuals and the environment.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The cyber semantic image plays an important role in supporting effective interaction.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individuals in different spaces evolve with the development of the environment.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In contrast, humans continually receive input from the environment and adjust behaviors when thinking and behaving.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The important thing is that the process of interaction is not predefined.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(2) Ability extension in complex space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Even for a single machine, its work process depends on real-time interactions and its semantic images.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1) Interaction requirements are raised in the physiological space, psychological space, socio space, and mental spaces from time to time.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>An interactive co-computing environment model incorporating machine computing, human reasoning and socio interaction is depicted in Fig.</a>
