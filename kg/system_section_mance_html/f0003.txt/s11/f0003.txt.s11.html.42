<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>An idea will be linked to sketch, to design, to the production processes, and further to the closed loops in the environment.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This concerns the modelling of the spaces, the mapping between spaces, the mechanism of influence, and the rules of linking and flows through links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The CP3SME is an open system since machines may be linked to existing machines from time to time or disconnected the current links according to the real-time requirement and rules in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is important for ensuring effective interaction since interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(5) The cyber space builds cyber semantic images during direct and indirect interactions so that it knows the past and present interactions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Turing machine is a closed system as its computing components and computing process is pre-defined and fixed, which cannot be changed by input and output.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The CP3SME needs a reflexive, self-organized, and adaptive architecture that can preserve semantic images of itself and versatile individuals in lifetime and manage significant behaviours, events and processes (e.g., in daily life, learning, creation and business).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the CP3SME, co-experiencing in multiple spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of various links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning are the basis of the cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The architecture links socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as physiological, psychological and mental statuses to create a complex intelligent environment for well-being.</a>
