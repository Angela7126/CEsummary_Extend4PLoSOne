<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A fundamental difference between machine and human is that humans can co-experience in multiple spaces and emerge semantic images and motivations according to psychological, physiological and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(6) Functions emerge from time to time with linking machines, services and humans as well as executing various flows such as information flow, knowledge flow, material flow, energy flow, and workflow in the environment [73][80].</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The CP3SME is an open system since machines may be linked to existing machines from time to time or disconnected the current links according to the real-time requirement and rules in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An interactive co-computing environment model incorporating machine computing, human reasoning and socio interaction is depicted in Fig.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The architecture links socio activities and processes, physical individuals, thoughts as well as physiological, psychological and mental statuses to create a complex intelligent environment for well-being.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It is important for ensuring effective interaction since interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In addition, a harmonious human-machine interactive interface is an important aspect of integrating machine intelligence, human intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Traditional intelligent systems rely on humans to define a problem, and then design a computing process to solve the problem by machine languages.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The CP3SME needs a reflexive, self-organized, and adaptive architecture that can preserve semantic images of itself and versatile individuals in lifetime and manage significant behaviours, events and processes (e.g., in daily life, learning, creation and business).</a>
