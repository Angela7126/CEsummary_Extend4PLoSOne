<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) Interaction requirements are raised in the physiological space, psychological space, socio space, and mental spaces from time to time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Laws of competition, symbiosis and cooperation among individuals and among communities in the evolution process of the environment need to be explored.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Turing machine is the model of computing and studying the extent of computing.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The logistic processes will leave semantic images in the environment and can be adapted according to the change of requirements.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The interactive environment operates for ensuring harmonious development of individuals and the environment.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Individuals in different spaces evolve with the development of the environment.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The CP3SME concerns not only machine intelligence, human intelligence and social intelligence as emphasized in the interactive semantics but also the closed loops in the environment.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An idea will be linked to sketch, to design, to the production processes, and further to the closed loops in the environment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This concerns the modelling of the spaces, the mapping between spaces, the mechanism of influence, and the rules of linking and flows through links.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The aim is a harmoniously evolved and sustainable environment.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(7) Rules of effective interaction among sense, language, semantics and reasoning.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In addition, a harmonious human-machine interactive interface is an important aspect of integrating machine intelligence, human intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This is not in line with the characteristics of human intelligence.</a>
