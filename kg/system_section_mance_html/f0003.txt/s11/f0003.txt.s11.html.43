<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This concerns the modelling of the spaces, the mapping between spaces, the mechanism of influence, and the rules of linking and flows through links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The CP3SME is an open system since machines may be linked to existing machines from time to time or disconnected the current links according to the real-time requirement and rules in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is important for ensuring effective interaction since interactions not only create links but also evolve semantic images.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(5) The cyber space builds cyber semantic images during direct and indirect interactions so that it knows the past and present interactions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Turing machine is a closed system as its computing components and computing process is pre-defined and fixed, which cannot be changed by input and output.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>and, the principles, laws and methods of interaction, influence, reasoning and explanation in the complex space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(5) Principles of interaction, transformation and flows.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) Interaction requirements are raised in the physiological space, psychological space, socio space, and mental spaces from time to time.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Laws of competition, symbiosis and cooperation among individuals and among communities in the evolution process of the environment need to be explored.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Turing machine is the model of computing and studying the extent of computing.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The logistic processes will leave semantic images in the environment and can be adapted according to the change of requirements.</a>
