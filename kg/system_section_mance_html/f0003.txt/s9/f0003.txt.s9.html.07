<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This type of complex link enables humans to understand and influence the cyber space through versatile artifacts like robots in the artifact space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The robots linked to the cyber space can also form cyber semantic images to reflect the physical space and themselves and to share with others.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
