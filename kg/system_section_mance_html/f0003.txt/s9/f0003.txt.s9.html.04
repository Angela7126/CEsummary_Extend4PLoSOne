<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Socio Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the socio space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The physiological, psychological, socio and mental status of individuals plays an important role in forming socio structure and socio development.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The influence of individual A on B through complex link l can be measured by the potential energy of nodes A and B, the potential energy of link l, and the times of effective interactions between A and B.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This is because the node with richer types of links offers higher probability to the new link to derive out more links so that communities have higher probability to be enriched or changed.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Complex links will enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of an apple in the cyber space can be linked to the apples in a supermarket with a price or on an apple tree with the information on temperature and nutrition in soil, linked to the relevant food web, and further linked to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can obtain the characteristics of the physical objects, and enables the mental space to reflect the real-time status of the physical objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The potential energy of an event can be measured by the number of involved individuals and the emerging rules of individuals in the complex link network.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Mental Space <-- Artifact Space --> Cyber Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the cyber space through the artifact space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Mental Space, which is the interaction between mental spaces through the cyber space.</a>
