<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Complex links will enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of an apple in the cyber space can be linked to the apples in a supermarket with a price or on an apple tree with the information on temperature and nutrition in soil, linked to the relevant food web, and further linked to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The physiological, psychological, socio and mental status of individuals plays an important role in forming socio structure and socio development.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This type of complex link enables humans to understand and influence the cyber space through versatile artifacts like robots in the artifact space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, complex links can link services of recommending restaurants to the favorite dish, to the best cooker, to the cooking process, to the food culture, and to the delivering service.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It can retrieve previous interaction topics, recommend potential partners, and inspire reasoning while interacting.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It can extract the SLNs from interactions, and make necessary abstraction and evolution during interaction based on the modeling of mental space and the translation between languages under different cultures.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Multiple candidate services would be available for selection or for composition to support effective interaction according to a service description language and the interaction interest.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>People who are good at communication can live longer than those with little socio interaction as helpful interaction can help relieve mental pressure and raise immunity [38].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can obtain the characteristics of the physical objects, and enables the mental space to reflect the real-time status of the physical objects.</a>
