<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Fig.12 compares the hyperlink, the semantic link, and the complex link.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, communities of different types will emerge and evolve according to different rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The semantic link connects semantic nodes with certain rules on relations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>They will influence the evolution of the network.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This is because the node with richer types of links offers higher probability to the new link to derive out more links so that communities have higher probability to be enriched or changed.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The hyperlink enables any web page to connect to any other page.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The node with richer types of links takes the higher priority to emerge than that with less or single type of links.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Different orders of operations may lead to different effects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An individual x in society has potential energy Ep(x) due to its centrality in complex link network and interaction.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>People who are good at communication can live longer than those with little socio interaction as helpful interaction can help relieve mental pressure and raise immunity [38].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The difference and competition among individuals leads to the formation of various network characteristics like the centrality [91].</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Therefore, the spouse relation is transformed into the divorce relation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It can extract the SLNs from interactions, and make necessary abstraction and evolution during interaction based on the modeling of mental space and the translation between languages under different cultures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Socio Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the socio space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The physiological, psychological, socio and mental status of individuals plays an important role in forming socio structure and socio development.</a>
