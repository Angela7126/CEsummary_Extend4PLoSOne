<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Fig.12 compares the hyperlink, the semantic link, and the complex link.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, communities of different types will emerge and evolve according to different rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>They will influence the evolution of the network.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The semantic link connects semantic nodes with certain rules on relations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The hyperlink enables any web page to connect to any other page.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Different orders of operations may lead to different effects.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The node with richer types of links takes the higher priority to emerge than that with less or single type of links.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is because the node with richer types of links offers higher probability to the new link to derive out more links so that communities have higher probability to be enriched or changed.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The difference and competition among individuals leads to the formation of various network characteristics like the centrality [91].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Therefore, the spouse relation is transformed into the divorce relation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>An individual x in society has potential energy Ep(x) due to its centrality in complex link network and interaction.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>People who are good at communication can live longer than those with little socio interaction as helpful interaction can help relieve mental pressure and raise immunity [38].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It can extract the SLNs from interactions, and make necessary abstraction and evolution during interaction based on the modeling of mental space and the translation between languages under different cultures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Complex links will enable interactions to pass through spaces, for example, text or image of an apple in the cyber space can be linked to the apples in a supermarket with a price or on an apple tree with the information on temperature and nutrition in soil, linked to the relevant food web, and further linked to the physical concepts like gravity.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The physiological, psychological, socio and mental status of individuals plays an important role in forming socio structure and socio development.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This type of complex link enables humans to understand and influence the cyber space through versatile artifacts like robots in the artifact space.</a>
