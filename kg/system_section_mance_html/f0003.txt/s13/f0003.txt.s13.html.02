<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Machine intelligence, human intelligence, and socio intelligence are extended in the complex space by linking within and through spaces, forming and improving the closed loops of complex links and flows through sensing, classifying, emerging, computing, communicating, interacting, controlling, behaving, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) Extending the hyperlink network to support some preliminary intelligence such as guided browsing, query implicit relations, question answering and explanation by introducing a semantic space and reasoning mechanisms such as relational reasoning, analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning, and complex reasoning.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This concerns new philosophical thinking, interactive computing model, nature of the complex linking such as dynamicity, symmetry and rules of various flows, the methods for improving various closed loops, and the methods for coordinating spaces, controlling and predicting evolution.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(2) Establishing a self-organized semantic networking model to support basic socio intelligence with some distinguished features such as self-organized peer-to-peer linking and high-performance routing, semantic communities and emerging principles, pervasive and effect-aware linking, and link recommendation.</a>
