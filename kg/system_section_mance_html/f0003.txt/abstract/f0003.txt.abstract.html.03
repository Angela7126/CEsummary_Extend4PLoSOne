<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Linking various spaces will create a complex space -- the Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-SocioMental Environment CP3SME.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>From multi-disciplinary perspective, this paper reviews previous ideas on various links, introduces the concept of cyberphysical society, proposes the ideal of the CP3SME including its definition, characteristics, and multi-disciplinary revolution, and explores the methodology of linking through spaces for cyber-physical-socio intelligence.</a>
