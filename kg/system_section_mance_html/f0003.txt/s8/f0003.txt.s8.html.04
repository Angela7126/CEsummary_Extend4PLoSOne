<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>concerns the location in the physical space (explanation may concern the real-time situation about the location), the location in the cyber space (e.g., the mail box or homepage), and the location in the socio space (e.g., at a friend's home, explanation may concern the status of the friend and relevant socio networks).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An artist in the socio space creates an artifact (e.g., sculpture) in the artifact space according to the semantic image emerged in the mental space, and then puts the artifact close to a physical object (e.g., hill) at latitude x and longitude y, and at time t.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Reasoning may include the unknown physical object (the black box) into a semantic image and derive relevant semantic links to other semantic images.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The mental space reflects the physical objects and the semantic links as abstract classes and conceptual relations (e.g., the nearby link), and links the classes when co-experiencing in multiple spaces (Fig.10 (b)).</a>
