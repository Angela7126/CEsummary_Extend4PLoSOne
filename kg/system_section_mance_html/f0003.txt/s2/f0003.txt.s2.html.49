<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Time dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be sensed and preserved as cyber semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This requires CP3SME to have an elastic time dimension and the models for the evolution of communities and individuals.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In the cyber space, zooming is an effective means to navigate from different facets, at different abstraction levels, and in different scopes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Health of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be linked to measures.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Evolution simulation can be slowed down by stretching time, which enables the details of evolution to be clearly observed.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>They can not only use languages to express ideas but also link the language representations to reasons in multiple spaces, to relevant research, and to applications.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Time compression accelerates evolution and enables interaction to pass through times.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Brain nets navigate with a kind of triangle-based grid cells [18], while humans often use distance space (e.g., using orthogonal latitude and longitude to locate surface objects on map) to locate objects in the physical space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space so that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Evidences of historical and cultural research will be easily available.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Coincidently, the Semantic Link Network reasons through triangle links [86].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Recommendation or evaluation will be explained from historical and cultural point of view.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>CP3SME will coordinate triangle reasoning/navigation, orthogonal locating and zooming.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>As the consequence of collaboration, the collaborators' mental spaces evolve toward more commonalities.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Both material culture and non-material culture will be preserved and efficiently shared.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Scientists will be able to access research objects and thoughts as well as their formation processes on demand through times.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The CP3SME will be efficient and low carbon as it will ensure optimal coordination between knowledge flow, information flow, material flow, energy flow, and value flow through spaces.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The dynamic human-centered micro-environment will be known by linking sensors to mobile phones and vehicles, collecting real-time information, and classifying information according to the location, distribution of population and pollution sources.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The statuses of artifacts (e.g., bridges) can be monitored in lifetime so that necessary maintenance can be carried out on time to ensure healthy status.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>This may lead to breakthrough in natural language processing.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>They are limited in ability to support effective intercultural collaboration as little semantics and culture are concerned.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>CP3SME reflects minds by establishing and evolving cyber semantic images for various behaviors in multiple spaces, for example, by tracing language using, interactions, and the change of various patterns during behaving.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>This means that they can not only communicate with peers but also access important thoughts through time.</a>
