<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Questions can be raised, answered and explained through the cooperation of multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the long-run, the global climate and the diversity of species in the physical space will be reflected in CP3SME through complex links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Time dimension can be compressed and stretched in the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(10) Energy and traffic.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(5) Society and life.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The CP3SME will reflect individuals, communities, interactions and events at multiple semantic layers.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Artifacts can be linked to the ideas, to the design processes, to the manufacturers, and to the manufacturing processes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) History and culture.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Health of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be linked to measures.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from the processes of controlling and computing, CP3SME executes with pervasive interactions between individuals within and cross spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The closed loop from production to consumption can be established to minimize the waste of material and energy with awareness of situations in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Different from digital archival, the CP3SME's preserving will be real-time, lifetime, and at multiple semantic layers.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The effect of psychological space, physiological space, mental space and socio space distinguishes the CP3SME from the Internet/Web of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In the long run, the CP3SME will also help individuals fulfill the meaning of life.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As human behaviors will influence the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space through the cyber space, previous security issues isolated in one space will pass through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Moreover, the individual to be viewed can sense the viewer, know the viewer, and presence virtually to events.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The well-being of humans and the harmony of the complex space take the priority.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>As individuals will live in a complex space, unhealthy individual or community in one space will influence the health of individuals or communities in the other spaces.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio (social and economic) space, and mental space cooperate with each other to extend human intelligence, machine intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Life Web pages will be the first stage of immigrating from the Web to the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>For human individuals, influence of unhealthy or sub-healthy will come from physical, physiological, psychological, socio, mental, and cyber spaces.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Change of individuals, communities or links in one space could influence those in the other spaces.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>This requires CP3SME to have an elastic time dimension and the models for the evolution of communities and individuals.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Situation includes health status, current micro environment, socio attributes, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Minds evolve with interaction between various individuals and reflect the patterns in different spaces.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>The CP3SME will be efficient and low carbon as it will ensure optimal coordination between knowledge flow, information flow, material flow, energy flow, and value flow through spaces.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>Children at home will be able to feel the presence of their parents who are not at home through complex links, and parents can know the situations around children, especially when special events occur.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>(7) Coordinating spaces.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>(8) Harmony.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>The environment and individuals have cyber semantic images to reflect their past and present status and the effect of interactions.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Evidences of historical and cultural research will be easily available.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>Energy supplies will link to requirements, road maps, patterns of traffic situation, parking spaces, and environment status.</a>
