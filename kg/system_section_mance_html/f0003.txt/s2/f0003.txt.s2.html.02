<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Through socio interaction, humans actively create and maintain complex links between spaces, evaluate and evolve socio values, and make final decisions to change personal statuses and influence the evolution of the spaces with certain probability.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Research concerns origin and essence of material, energy, information, knowledge, service, life, mind and society in the environment, harmonious and sustainable development of the environment, and the methodology for studying, developing and maintaining the environment.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Situation includes health status, current micro environment, socio attributes, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The environment will ensure healthy and meaningful life of individuals, and maintain a reasonable expansion of population of various individuals and the scopes of behaviors according to the overall capacity and the material, energy, information, knowledge and service flow cycles.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Energy supplies will link to requirements, road maps, patterns of traffic situation, parking spaces, and environment status.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Brain nets navigate with a kind of triangle-based grid cells [18], while humans often use distance space (e.g., using orthogonal latitude and longitude to locate surface objects on map) to locate objects in the physical space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Students can learn natural and socio laws not only from linguistic and mathematical description in textbooks but also from the linked physical, physiological, psychological and socio phenomena through times.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Photos in personal Web pages will be real-time images in the multi-dimensional classification space including such dimensions as time, location, event, audio, and video about the person.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The closed loop from production to consumption can be established to minimize the waste of material and energy with awareness of situations in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be sensed and preserved as cyber semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As human behaviors will influence the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space through the cyber space, previous security issues isolated in one space will pass through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The dynamic human-centered micro-environment will be known by linking sensors to mobile phones and vehicles, collecting real-time information, and classifying information according to the location, distribution of population and pollution sources.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Function, structure, designer, owner, developer, and even ecological, physiological, psychological and socio effects will be accessible.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio (social and economic) space, and mental space cooperate with each other to extend human intelligence, machine intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>CP3SME concerns harmonious development of the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space rather than just the speed and capacity of computing and communication.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>CP3SME reflects minds by establishing and evolving cyber semantic images for various behaviors in multiple spaces, for example, by tracing language using, interactions, and the change of various patterns during behaving.</a>
