<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As human behaviors will influence the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space through the cyber space, previous security issues isolated in one space will pass through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>CP3SME concerns harmonious development of the cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio space and mental space rather than just the speed and capacity of computing and communication.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Science fiction will not only imagine in the symbol space but also link imagination in the mental space to materials, culture and events in the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and social space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The cyber space, physical space, physiological space, psychological space, socio (social and economic) space, and mental space cooperate with each other to extend human intelligence, machine intelligence and socio intelligence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The effect of psychological space, physiological space, mental space and socio space distinguishes the CP3SME from the Internet/Web of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Situation includes health status, current micro environment, socio attributes, socio energy, and the lifetime semantic images of individuals.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As individuals will live in a complex space, unhealthy individual or community in one space will influence the health of individuals or communities in the other spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For human individuals, influence of unhealthy or sub-healthy will come from physical, physiological, psychological, socio, mental, and cyber spaces.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Through socio interaction, humans actively create and maintain complex links between spaces, evaluate and evolve socio values, and make final decisions to change personal statuses and influence the evolution of the spaces with certain probability.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Adding a time dimension to the multi-dimensional classification space can form the space for showing the change of resources when compressing and stretching the time dimension [82].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Cyber-Physical-Socio Ecology concerns how to keep a reasonable expansion of the cyber space and the socio space so that they can harmoniously evolve with the physical space otherwise it may form negative influence on the whole environment [64].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Change of individuals, communities or links in one space could influence those in the other spaces.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Evaluation result will be linked to socio influence through time.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Scientific thoughts will efficiently influence society through complex links.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The Cyber-Physical-Physiological-Psychological-Socio-Mental Environment CP3SME is a multi-dimensional complex space that generates and evolves diverse spaces to contain various types of individuals interacting with, reflecting, or influencing each other through various links within space or through spaces.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The CP3SME will reflect individuals, communities, interactions and events at multiple semantic layers.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Energy supplies will link to requirements, road maps, patterns of traffic situation, parking spaces, and environment status.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Individuals, family trees, thoughts, and socio events will be sensed and preserved as cyber semantic images that can be accessed through times.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Society will be safer and life quality will be higher as the status of key individuals (e.g., people, socio facilities, and production sites), communities, and events will have cyber semantic images that can help make precaution.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Health of individuals can be detected and evaluated on time, and evaluation results can be linked to measures.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Minds evolve with interaction between various individuals and reflect the patterns in different spaces.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The CP3SME will help people with different cultural backgrounds collaborate effectively by transforming symbol forms, linking symbols to different spaces, and establishing peers' semantic images in their mental spaces.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The environment and individuals have cyber semantic images to reflect their past and present status and the effect of interactions.</a>
