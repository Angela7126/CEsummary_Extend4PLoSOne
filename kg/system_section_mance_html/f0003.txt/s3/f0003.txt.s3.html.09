<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In CP3SME, symbols will be linked to the cyber space, physical space, psychological space, physiological space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from other individuals, humans can actively link symbols to the physical space, and to the socio space through the physiological space, psychological space, and mental space.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>To explore the interaction between the mental space, psychological space, physiological space, and socio space is fundamental to understand human intelligence.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Human bodies belong to the physical space, while human behaviors belong to the socio space, physiological space and psychological space, and thoughts belong to the mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>With the development of the socio space, subspaces such as art space and economic space were separated from the socio space to hold respective rules.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Versatile spaces such as the mental space and the socio space are generated as the effect of evolution.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Individuals have diversity and can belong to more than one space, e.g., artifacts belong to the physical space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(5) The generation of the socio space to contain socio individuals (e.g., human, behavior, good, and event), communities, relations, values, and rules.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
