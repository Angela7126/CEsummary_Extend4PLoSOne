<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) The generation of the psychological space to hold the perception, cognition, attention, emotion, motivation, behavior, and some underlying physiological and neurological processes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, the complex distance between individuals involved in a socio event can be defined according to the physical distances such as road length and straight-line distance, socio distances based on friendship or harmonious interaction, and symbol distances based on profiles.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
