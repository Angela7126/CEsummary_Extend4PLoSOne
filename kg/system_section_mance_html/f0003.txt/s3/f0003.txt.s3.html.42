<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, the event of volcanic eruptions in the physical space will lead to cancelation of relevant flights, and lead to cancelation of the socio events like conferences held within the region.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A significant event in the physical space may generate or influence an event in the socio space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The process of classification indicates the semantics of the form.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individuals can only know a small part of the space and will know relatively less due to the limitation of lifetime and unlimited expansion of documents.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Based on individual interactive semantic base, individual mental spaces can also self-organize into communities through multiple interaction channels.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(3) The generation of the psychological space to hold the perception, cognition, attention, emotion, motivation, behavior, and some underlying physiological and neurological processes.</a>
