<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The real-time status of an artifact (e.g., bridge) and the influence from the socio space and the physical space can be reflected in the cyber space through various sensors during the whole process of innovation and design.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The change of mental space will change semantic images, which will influence behaviors in the physical space, cyber space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, humans can view complex link networks in the socio space and relevant real-time events in the physical space while reading or writing in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>While drinking tea, humans can know the characteristics of the tea and its production process from the touch table, enjoy the tea-cultural performance in the physical space, verify the quality of the tea through the equipments linked to the touch table, and, access the soil status of the tea trees in the physical space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, linking the agricultural ecological system to the industrial ecological system enables some waste of industry to be used as the fertilizer of crops, and enables the agricultural products to be the raw materials of some industries.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(4) The mental space will develop new functions as it will emerge and evolve new semantic images when reflecting multiple spaces simultaneously.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Changes in the physical space such as the increase of roads and buildings will influence the cyber space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The material flows, information flows, and control flows within space and between spaces form closed loops within the environment.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Changes in the socio space and cyber space will influence interaction between humans, which will influence the mental space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Changes in the socio space like population increase will influence the physical space and the cyber space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
