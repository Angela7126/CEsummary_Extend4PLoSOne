<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The final design can lead to the artifacts in the artifact space through a manufacture process.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This indicates a new design paradigm that enables designers and users to co-experience during the whole design process.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Humans can not only sense from multiple channels but also form close loops through sensing, behaving, emerging semantic images, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Practice (e.g., dictation) helps establish the links between the behaviors through different channels and between behaviors and semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(5) Complex linking different spaces enables one space to make use of material, energy and information in the other space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This is why blind people cannot write in the normal natural languages.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Behaving through one type of channel (e.g., writing) accompanies sensing through another type of channel (e.g., vision).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(4) The mental space will develop new functions as it will emerge and evolve new semantic images when reflecting multiple spaces simultaneously.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, linking the agricultural ecological system to the industrial ecological system enables some waste of industry to be used as the fertilizer of crops, and enables the agricultural products to be the raw materials of some industries.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(3) The cyber-physical-socio effects of various behaviors are available so that appropriate decisions can be made to ensure harmonious development of various spaces.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The change of mental space will change semantic images, which will influence behaviors in the physical space, cyber space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Changes in the socio space like population increase will influence the physical space and the cyber space.</a>
