<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The change of mental space will change semantic images, which will influence behaviors in the physical space, cyber space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Changes in the socio space like population increase will influence the physical space and the cyber space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Changes in the socio space and cyber space will influence interaction between humans, which will influence the mental space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Changes in the physical space such as the increase of roads and buildings will influence the cyber space and the socio space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As shown in Fig.16, thoughts are inspired by the requirements raised in the socio space and the co-experiences in the physical space, socio space, artifact space, physiological space, and psychological space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A prototype can be refined through reflection and reference in the physical space, artifact space, and socio space as well as through reasoning processes in the mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The real-time status of an artifact (e.g., bridge) and the influence from the socio space and the physical space can be reflected in the cyber space through various sensors during the whole process of innovation and design.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For example, humans can view complex link networks in the socio space and relevant real-time events in the physical space while reading or writing in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(2) Multi-dimensional real-time status about individuals and communities in the physical space and the socio space can be captured.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Influence through spaces can also form closed loops.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For example, climate change in the physical space may influence agriculture, which may influence the society.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The final design can lead to the artifacts in the artifact space through a manufacture process.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The material flows, information flows, and control flows within space and between spaces form closed loops within the environment.</a>
