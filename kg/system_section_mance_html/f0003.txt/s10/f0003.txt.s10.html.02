<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Humans can not only sense from multiple channels but also form close loops through sensing, behaving, emerging semantic images, and reasoning.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For example, linking the agricultural ecological system to the industrial ecological system enables some waste of industry to be used as the fertilizer of crops, and enables the agricultural products to be the raw materials of some industries.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>15 depicts the closed loops of sensing, behaving and emerging semantic images through multiple channels.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, humans can view complex link networks in the socio space and relevant real-time events in the physical space while reading or writing in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>How do sense, behavior, language and reasoning interact with and influence each other is the foundation of cognition and is a challenge issue of sciences, technologies and socio development.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Complex link can be chained and closed for improving the performance of behaviors in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The closed loops of material flow and energy flow can achieve harmonious ecological effect [28].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The closed loop of flows through the spaces form a sustainable innovation environment.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(4) The mental space will develop new functions as it will emerge and evolve new semantic images when reflecting multiple spaces simultaneously.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As shown in Fig.16, thoughts are inspired by the requirements raised in the socio space and the co-experiences in the physical space, socio space, artifact space, physiological space, and psychological space.</a>
