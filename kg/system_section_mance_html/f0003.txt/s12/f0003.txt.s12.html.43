<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Psychological research indicates that brain uses different regions to process the first language and non first languages.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>New philosophical issues will arise in CP3SME research as the world people live and the way people interact with each other have been changed greatly with the generation and evolution of various spaces.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The epistemology has been emphasized in the effort to solve the semantics problem [77].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This implies an approach to improving the current research in many areas such as the semantic web, natural language processing, and text understanding by adding a little interaction.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The scientific pursuit of the CP3SME brings challenging philosophical issues.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A little interaction helps a lot in understanding since interactions enable individuals to co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Different semantic images may emerge when a form is sensed by different individuals because they have different experience.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Various encyclopedias are to establish consensus by collecting multiple definitions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Laozi respected the nature rather than action as he thought that unnatural act will break natural balance.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Form and semantics constitute a dimension of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>One form may be used to indicate different semantics by different individuals, and different forms may be used to indicate the same semantics.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Cultural and experience influence the way and effectiveness of using various forms to indicate semantics.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Experience, reason and social construction contribute to the formation of mind from different facets and scales.</a>
