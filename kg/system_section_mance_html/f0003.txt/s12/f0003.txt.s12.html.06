<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A semantic link network of forms can help individuals emerge semantic images.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Forms in more spaces provide richer experience for indicating semantic images.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Emerging semantic images through experience and reason.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Two individual mental spaces can emerge similar semantic images about one form, and the similarity can be increased through an interaction process.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Semantic linking through spaces extends experience and reasoning to more spaces.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For example, the symbol space evolves differently from the physical space, mental space, and cyber space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Semantic images emerge and evolve with continuous reflection and reasoning while co-experiencing in various spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(5) Similarity in emerging semantic images.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>An apple in the physical space we observed is form, its image in the cyber space is form, its weight and price in the socio space are forms, the word "apple" in the symbol space is form, and the brain signal reflection is also form.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>These ideas are in line with the method of modeling the mental space and semantic image ?</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Semantics emerges and evolves with various interactions through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>integrating the multi-dimensional classification space and the semantic link network [82][87].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>These are early ideas on social regulations and emerging semantics.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>All things in other spaces can be viewed as forms from the mental space.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>For example, a semantic link network of words and images can render semantic image better than just one word.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>physical world, subjective mental world, and objective knowledge world.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
