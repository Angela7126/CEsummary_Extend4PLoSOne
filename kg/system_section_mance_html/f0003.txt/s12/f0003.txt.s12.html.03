<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Form and semantics constitute a dimension of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One form may be used to indicate different semantics by different individuals, and different forms may be used to indicate the same semantics.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Cultural and experience influence the way and effectiveness of using various forms to indicate semantics.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Experience, reason and social construction contribute to the formation of mind from different facets and scales.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Socrates emphasized the importance of friendship and community in human life.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Their ideas are significant to explore socio relations and the harmony in CP3SME.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Ontology engineering and ontology mapping are topics in the semantic web area.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different from his static classification, the evolving space model proposed in this paper emphasizes the dynamicity and diversity of the spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>His philosophical idea emphasizes the unification of human and the nature.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This idea is in line with the statistical approaches and the interactive semantics [89].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For example, the symbol space evolves differently from the physical space, mental space, and cyber space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Rationalism and empiricism have different viewpoints on the formation of worldview and knowledge.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Two individual mental spaces can emerge similar semantic images about one form, and the similarity can be increased through an interaction process.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Kant believed that passive experience is not the beginning of understanding, and that there are some categories that human beings actively use to make sense of the world.</a>
