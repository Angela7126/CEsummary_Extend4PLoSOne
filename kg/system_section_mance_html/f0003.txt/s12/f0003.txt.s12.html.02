<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For example, Minsky regarded minds as the collections of vast number of semi-autonomous, intricately connected agents, and gave an explanation of how minds relate to such functions as motivation, language, memory, learning, intentions, and metaphors.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Human beings rely on innate fundamental concepts or categories in minds such as space and time to organize and interpret sense experience.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This implies an approach to improving the current research in many areas such as the semantic web, natural language processing, and text understanding by adding a little interaction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since the formation of modern science, many scientists such as Newton, Maxwell and Einstein have made great effort to explore the uniformity of the world.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>On the contrary, Dreyfus argued that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge [19].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Social constructionism like Berger and Luckmann argue that knowledge including commonsense derives from and evolves through social interactions [3].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from his static classification, the evolving space model proposed in this paper emphasizes the dynamicity and diversity of the spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>An apple in the physical space we observed is form, its image in the cyber space is form, its weight and price in the socio space are forms, the word "apple" in the symbol space is form, and the brain signal reflection is also form.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Laozi respected the nature rather than action as he thought that unnatural act will break natural balance.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Experience, reason and social construction contribute to the formation of mind from different facets and scales.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For example, Maxwell created the electromagnetic theory by unveiling the uniformity of electricity, magnetism and light.</a>
