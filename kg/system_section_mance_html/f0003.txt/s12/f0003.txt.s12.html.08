<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Ontology engineering and ontology mapping are topics in the semantic web area.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A semantic link network of forms can help individuals emerge semantic images.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, the symbol space evolves differently from the physical space, mental space, and cyber space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Forms in more spaces provide richer experience for indicating semantic images.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The terminology "ontology" was borrowed by computer scientists to solve the semantics problem.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Cultural and experience influence the way and effectiveness of using various forms to indicate semantics.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Form and semantics constitute a dimension of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>An apple in the physical space we observed is form, its image in the cyber space is form, its weight and price in the socio space are forms, the word "apple" in the symbol space is form, and the brain signal reflection is also form.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Semantic linking through spaces extends experience and reasoning to more spaces.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>All things in other spaces can be viewed as forms from the mental space.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Semantics emerges and evolves with various interactions through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Two individual mental spaces can emerge similar semantic images about one form, and the similarity can be increased through an interaction process.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>These are early ideas on social regulations and emerging semantics.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(2) Emerging semantic images through experience and reason.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The epistemology has been emphasized in the effort to solve the semantics problem [77].</a>
