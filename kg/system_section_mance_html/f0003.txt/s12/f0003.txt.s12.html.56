<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The epistemology has been emphasized in the effort to solve the semantics problem [77].</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Psychological research indicates that brain uses different regions to process the first language and non first languages.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The generation and evolution of spaces can be regarded as a continuous classification process.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>New philosophical issues will arise in CP3SME research as the world people live and the way people interact with each other have been changed greatly with the generation and evolution of various spaces.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>So, classification, link and rule are the basic form of the CP3SME.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This implies an approach to improving the current research in many areas such as the semantic web, natural language processing, and text understanding by adding a little interaction.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The scientific pursuit of the CP3SME brings challenging philosophical issues.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A little interaction helps a lot in understanding since interactions enable individuals to co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Different semantic images may emerge when a form is sensed by different individuals because they have different experience.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Various encyclopedias are to establish consensus by collecting multiple definitions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Laozi respected the nature rather than action as he thought that unnatural act will break natural balance.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A semantic link network of forms can help individuals emerge semantic images.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Forms in more spaces provide richer experience for indicating semantic images.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
