<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Only the mental space has the ability to emerge and explain socio semantics since the mental space has been reflecting various spaces and carrying out reasoning in lifetime.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An apple in the physical space we observed is form, its image in the cyber space is form, its weight and price in the socio space are forms, the word "apple" in the symbol space is form, and the brain signal reflection is also form.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This indicates that semantics cannot be got by operating forms, and that machines are limited in ability to generate social semantics by processing symbols without the participation of mental space, physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Semantic images emerge and evolve when forms are sensed, classified, linked, and reasoned according to the existing semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Social constructionism like Berger and Luckmann argue that knowledge including commonsense derives from and evolves through social interactions [3].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Human beings rely on innate fundamental concepts or categories in minds such as space and time to organize and interpret sense experience.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This implies that the current approaches to the semantic web, machine translation, and text understanding through processing symbols in the cyber space is questionable in essence.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Two individual mental spaces can emerge similar semantic images about one form, and the similarity can be increased through an interaction process.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A semantic link network of forms can help individuals emerge semantic images.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, a semantic link network of words and images can render semantic image better than just one word.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Multiple forms from different spaces can help indicate semantics, and the first language is more effective in indicating semantics than using the second language due to culture difference.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Forms in more spaces provide richer experience for indicating semantic images.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This implies an approach to improving the current research in many areas such as the semantic web, natural language processing, and text understanding by adding a little interaction.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>On the contrary, Dreyfus argued that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge [19].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Kant believed that passive experience is not the beginning of understanding, and that there are some categories that human beings actively use to make sense of the world.</a>
