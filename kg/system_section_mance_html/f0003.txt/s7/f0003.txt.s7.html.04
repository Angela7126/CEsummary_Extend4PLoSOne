<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>the classes of two ends, the semantic link triangle that contains the semantic link, the classes (subclass and superclass) in the classification hierarchy corresponding to the semantic link indicator, the rules that use or derive the semantic link, and the use cases of the semantic link.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Adding semantic nodes or links to SLN or removing them from SLN may have different influence on the network since different semantic nodes and links play different roles.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Potential semantic links may be derived out from SLN according to Rules when a semantic link l indicated by the concept hierarchy is added to SLN at time t, i.e., SLN(t+1) = Reason(SLN(t) U {l(t)}, Rules).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The semantic lens enables SLN to be viewed from a particular semantic node to its semantic communities at different levels [89].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Others reflect the behaviors between semantic nodes called behavior-based semantic link, e.g., friend relation reflects the satisfactory of interaction between semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Semantic nodes can include rich contents so that an SLN is not only for machines to process but also for humans to operate, emerge semantic images and reasoning.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Individuals have certain privilege to add semantic nodes, semantic links and rules to SLN or delete them from SLN.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Versatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The semantic image of an SLN emerges from mapping it into the semantic space and from linking it to commonsense, reasoning, evolution, and socio interaction.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different from previous symbolized commonsense representation, commonsense in CP3SME will link symbols to semantic images, e.g., the word u'\u2018' professor' links to existing relevant sense and semantic images about teaching, research, publication, project and student.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Some semantic links reflect the relations between attributes called attribute-based semantic link, e.g., olderThan reflects the order between age attributes.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>the classes of the emerging semantic nodes and semantic links according to the emerging principles and the class of the high-level community that includes it [87].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The cyber semantic image of an SLN emerges at different abstraction levels and scales through the semantic lens.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>A semantic node can participate in reasoning when necessary according to the known situation such as the neighbor semantic links and relevant rules.</a>
