<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Versatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Adding semantic nodes or links to SLN or removing them from SLN may have different influence on the network since different semantic nodes and links play different roles.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A semantic node can participate in reasoning when necessary according to the known situation such as the neighbor semantic links and relevant rules.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>the classes of the emerging semantic nodes and semantic links according to the emerging principles and the class of the high-level community that includes it [87].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Semantic nodes can include rich contents so that an SLN is not only for machines to process but also for humans to operate, emerge semantic images and reasoning.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Reasoning leads to the dependence between semantic links and the dependence between operations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Commonsense of a community is the result of socio classification and regulation on attributes, objects, classes, relations, behaviors and rules.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Regarding semantic nodes of SLN as agents, multi-agent (MA) techniques can be adopted to enhance SLN [72].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Adding a certain number of semantic links, different semantic covers on different topics may emerge [87][88].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The result of operation may be different if different orders of operations are applied to an SLN [74].</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The above discussion shows that SLN is different from previous links and graph-based models in goal, model, method and research issues.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Regarding class or object as node, the object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, method, roles, and functional modeling in OOMD support the specialization of SLN.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A semantic node can be a semantic link network.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>8 depicts the way to enrich SLN for detailed function modeling by making use of OOMD, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), in the background of interactions between multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Reasoning can carry out locally because it is not necessary to derive out all relations to overload storage.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>The semantic image of an SLN emerges from mapping it into the semantic space and from linking it to commonsense, reasoning, evolution, and socio interaction.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Socio requirements trigger self-organization of services based on SOA to meet the requirements.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Adding a semantic link to an SLN tends to reduce its semantic communities.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The basic services can be implemented by composing the classes defined in OOMD.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
