<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The semantic image of an SLN emerges from mapping it into the semantic space and from linking it to commonsense, reasoning, evolution, and socio interaction.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Versatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Adding a semantic link to an SLN tends to reduce its semantic communities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>the classes of two ends, the semantic link triangle that contains the semantic link, the classes (subclass and superclass) in the classification hierarchy corresponding to the semantic link indicator, the rules that use or derive the semantic link, and the use cases of the semantic link.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Individuals have certain privilege to add semantic nodes, semantic links and rules to SLN or delete them from SLN.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Removing a semantic link from an SLN tends to increase its semantic communities.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A semantic node can be a class, an instance, or a semantic link network.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The semantic lens enables SLN to be viewed from a particular semantic node to its semantic communities at different levels [89].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Others reflect the behaviors between semantic nodes called behavior-based semantic link, e.g., friend relation reflects the satisfactory of interaction between semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A semantic link indicates a relation between two semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Adding semantic nodes or links to SLN or removing them from SLN may have different influence on the network since different semantic nodes and links play different roles.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Potential semantic links may be derived out from SLN according to Rules when a semantic link l indicated by the concept hierarchy is added to SLN at time t, i.e., SLN(t+1) = Reason(SLN(t) U {l(t)}, Rules).</a>

<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Mapping SLN into the semantic space concerns the following mappings:</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>Adding new semantic links and rules to the SLN may incur new reasoning or influence.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>The cyber semantic image of an SLN emerges at different abstraction levels and scales through the semantic lens.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>A semantic node can participate in reasoning when necessary according to the known situation such as the neighbor semantic links and relevant rules.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(5) Mapping an SLN into a semantic range, which is determined by the minimum semantic cover ?</a>
