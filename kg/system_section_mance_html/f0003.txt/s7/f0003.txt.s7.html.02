<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Different from previous symbolized commonsense representation, commonsense in CP3SME will link symbols to semantic images, e.g., the word u'\u2018' professor' links to existing relevant sense and semantic images about teaching, research, publication, project and student.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The characteristics of SLN such as rules, complex reasoning, community, centrality, linking effect, decentralized semantic networking, self-organization, and semantic image will also enhance OOMD and MA by regarding classes, objects or agents as semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The basic semantic links in the physical space include the spatial relation, movement relation, symbiosis relation, energy transformation relation and material flow (e.g., water flow and nutrition flow through food web).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The massively collaborative online repositories such as Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org/) and ODP (Open Directory Project, www.dmoz.org/) can be used to build the hierarchy based on the analysis of how people define and evolve the classes.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>8 depicts the way to enrich SLN for detailed function modeling by making use of OOMD, OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture), in the background of interactions between multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Regarding class or object as node, the object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, method, roles, and functional modeling in OOMD support the specialization of SLN.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Commonsense of a community is the result of socio classification and regulation on attributes, objects, classes, relations, behaviors and rules.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Visualizing the evolution process and the effects of operations helps humans to link relevant semantic images.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Answering these questions needs to discover the implicit semantic links between linked objects based on uncertain reasoning.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Others reflect the behaviors between semantic nodes called behavior-based semantic link, e.g., friend relation reflects the satisfactory of interaction between semantic nodes.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>its class and subclasses, the semantic link triangle that includes the semantic node as vertex, the classes of the linked nodes, and its instances.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Some semantic links reflect the relations between attributes called attribute-based semantic link, e.g., olderThan reflects the order between age attributes.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Interaction incurs information flow through mental spaces and also inspires knowledge flow through the semantic images in the mental spaces.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The above discussion shows that SLN is different from previous links and graph-based models in goal, model, method and research issues.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>How can a query be efficiently routed in a large self-organized semantic link network through explicit or implicit semantic link paths?</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Semantic nodes can include rich contents so that an SLN is not only for machines to process but also for humans to operate, emerge semantic images and reasoning.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>The cyber semantic image of an SLN emerges at different abstraction levels and scales through the semantic lens.</a>
