<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The semantic image of an SLN emerges from mapping it into the semantic space and from linking it to commonsense, reasoning, evolution, and socio interaction.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Adding new semantic links and rules to the SLN may incur new reasoning or influence.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, professor is teacher (the professor class belongs to the teacher class), and teacher is human (the teacher class belongs to the human class).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The form of a semantic node can be denoted as n[c], where n is its name indicated in the symbol space, and c is its class.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Correspondingly, the semantic image of SLN changes with the evolution of SLN through human behaviors.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>the classes of two ends, the semantic link triangle that contains the semantic link, the classes (subclass and superclass) in the classification hierarchy corresponding to the semantic link indicator, the rules that use or derive the semantic link, and the use cases of the semantic link.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>

<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>A semantic node can participate in reasoning when necessary according to the known situation such as the neighbor semantic links and relevant rules.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>The change of semantic communities in an SLN reflects its obvious movement.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>A semantic node can be a class, an instance, or a semantic link network.</a>
