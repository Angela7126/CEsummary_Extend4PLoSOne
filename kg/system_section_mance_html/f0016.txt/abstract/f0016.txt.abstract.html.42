<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because patients aren't values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>By this is meant that they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don't recognize their own limitations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It would therefore be difficult to modify MYCIN to learn from its experience.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Doctors, hospitals, illness and death are absent.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>When a rule is activated, MYCIN tests whether the pattern part matches the database.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Programmers always develop the idea that the users of their programs are idiots, so the opinion that doctors aren't smart enough not to be misled by MYCIN's limitations may be at least partly a consequence of this ideology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Nevertheless, hardly any of them have certain common sense knowledge and ability possessed by any non-feeble-minded human.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When MYCIN is used in its intended manner it scores better than medical students or interns or practicing physicians and on a par with experts in bacterial diseases when the latter are asked to perform in the same way.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Some said it would be ok if there were a means of keeping MYCIN's database current with new discoveries in the field, i.e.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Others say that MYCIN is not even close to usable except experimentally, because it doesn't know its own limitations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>If not the pattern fails and MYCIN tries another.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This lack makes them "brittle".</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>At present it's popular, perhaps because new AI knowledge offers new hope of progress.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Common sense facts and methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The production formalism turned out to be suitable for representing a large amount of information about the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>After asking basic facts about the patient such as name, sex and age, MYCIN asks about suspected bacterial organisms, suspected sites of infection, the presence of specific symptoms (e.g.</a>
