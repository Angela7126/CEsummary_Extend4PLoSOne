<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The production formalism turned out to be suitable for representing a large amount of information about the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>After asking basic facts about the patient such as name, sex and age, MYCIN asks about suspected bacterial organisms, suspected sites of infection, the presence of specific symptoms (e.g.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult, and the number of scientists working in the area is still far too small.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Its major innovations over many previous expert systems were that it uses measures of uncertainty (not probabilities) for its diagnoses and the fact that it is prepared to explain its reasoning to the physician, so he can decide whether to accept it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>MYCIN's program, written in a general scheme called EMYCIN, is a socalled production system.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Programmers always develop the idea that the users of their programs are idiots, so the opinion that doctors aren't smart enough not to be misled by MYCIN's limitations may be at least partly a consequence of this ideology.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When MYCIN is used in its intended manner it scores better than medical students or interns or practicing physicians and on a par with experts in bacterial diseases when the latter are asked to perform in the same way.</a>
