<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This is because patients aren't values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>When a rule is activated, MYCIN tests whether the pattern part matches the database.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It would therefore be difficult to modify MYCIN to learn from its experience.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Nevertheless, hardly any of them have certain common sense knowledge and ability possessed by any non-feeble-minded human.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Doctors, hospitals, illness and death are absent.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>By this is meant that they are difficult to extend beyond the scope originally contemplated by their designers, and they usually don't recognize their own limitations.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If not the pattern fails and MYCIN tries another.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Others say that MYCIN is not even close to usable except experimentally, because it doesn't know its own limitations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Programmers always develop the idea that the users of their programs are idiots, so the opinion that doctors aren't smart enough not to be misled by MYCIN's limitations may be at least partly a consequence of this ideology.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>When MYCIN is used in its intended manner it scores better than medical students or interns or practicing physicians and on a par with experts in bacterial diseases when the latter are asked to perform in the same way.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Some said it would be ok if there were a means of keeping MYCIN's database current with new discoveries in the field, i.e.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This lack makes them "brittle".</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>At present it's popular, perhaps because new AI knowledge offers new hope of progress.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>We'll list some areas of common sense knowledge and reasoning ability and also apply the criteria to MYCIN and other hypothetical programs operating in MYCIN's domain.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>MYCIN conducts a question and answer dialog.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Many important applications will require common sense abilities.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It does reasonably well without common sense, provided the user has common sense and understands the program's limitations.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.</a>
