<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>An expert system is a computer program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I suppose this is partly a question of whether the doctor using MYCIN is trusted to understand the documentation about its limitations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When a rule is activated, MYCIN tests whether the pattern part matches the database.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The ontology of a program is the set of entities that its variables range over.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>While the dialog is in English, MYCIN avoids having to understand freely written English by controlling the dialog.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>However, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult, and the number of scientists working in the area is still far too small.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Some said it would be ok if there were a means of keeping MYCIN's database current with new discoveries in the field, i.e.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>It does reasonably well without common sense, provided the user has common sense and understands the program's limitations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>On the other hand it may be really true that some measure of common sense is required for usefulness even in this narrow domain.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We'll list some areas of common sense knowledge and reasoning ability and also apply the criteria to MYCIN and other hypothetical programs operating in MYCIN's domain.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The whole process of questioning and recommending is built up out of productions.</a>
