<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A production system is a collection of rules, each of which has two parts -- a pattern part and an action part.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>MYCIN's program, written in a general scheme called EMYCIN, is a socalled production system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If not the pattern fails and MYCIN tries another.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If so this results in the variables in the pattern being matched to whatever entities are required for the match of the database.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>MYCIN conducts a question and answer dialog.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This is because patients aren't values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>While the dialog is in English, MYCIN avoids having to understand freely written English by controlling the dialog.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The whole process of questioning and recommending is built up out of productions.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>After asking basic facts about the patient such as name, sex and age, MYCIN asks about suspected bacterial organisms, suspected sites of infection, the presence of specific symptoms (e.g.</a>

<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The ontology of a program is the set of entities that its variables range over.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, MYCIN has not been put into production use, and the reasons given by experts in the area varied when I asked whether it would be appropriate to sell MYCIN cassettes to doctors wanting to put it on their micro-computers.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The production formalism turned out to be suitable for representing a large amount of information about the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections.</a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>For example, MYCIN would have to be told about Legionnaire's disease and the associated Legionnella bacteria which became understood only after MYCIN was finished.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>An example of MYCIN not knowing its limitations can be excited by telling MYCIN that the patient has Cholerae Vibrio in his intestines.</a>
