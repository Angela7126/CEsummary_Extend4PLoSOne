<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When a rule is activated, MYCIN tests whether the pattern part matches the database.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the match is successful, then MYCIN performs the action part of the pattern using the values of the variables determined by the pattern part.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>MYCIN conducts a question and answer dialog.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We'll list some areas of common sense knowledge and reasoning ability and also apply the criteria to MYCIN and other hypothetical programs operating in MYCIN's domain.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the specific patient.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Many important applications will require common sense abilities.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>MYCIN's ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It does reasonably well without common sense, provided the user has common sense and understands the program's limitations.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The object of this lecture is to describe common sense abilities and the problems that require them.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An expert system is a computer program intended to embody the knowledge and ability of an expert in a certain domain.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A production system is a collection of rules, each of which has two parts -- a pattern part and an action part.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>An example of MYCIN not knowing its limitations can be excited by telling MYCIN that the patient has Cholerae Vibrio in his intestines.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>After asking basic facts about the patient such as name, sex and age, MYCIN asks about suspected bacterial organisms, suspected sites of infection, the presence of specific symptoms (e.g.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>While the dialog is in English, MYCIN avoids having to understand freely written English by controlling the dialog.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(MYCIN is very stubborn about new bacteria, and simply replies "unrecognized response".</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Common sense facts and methods are only very partially understood today, and extending this understanding is the key problem facing artificial intelligence.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This is because patients aren't values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two different patients.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Our discussion of MYCIN begins with its ontology.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>MYCIN's program, written in a general scheme called EMYCIN, is a socalled production system.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>However, expressing common sense knowledge in formal terms has proved very difficult, and the number of scientists working in the area is still far too small.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>If not the pattern fails and MYCIN tries another.</a>
