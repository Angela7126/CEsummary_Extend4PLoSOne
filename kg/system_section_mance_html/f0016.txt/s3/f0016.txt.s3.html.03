<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A mathematical description of circumscription is beyond the scope of this lecture, but the general idea is straightforward.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There may be some new conclusions, but every sentence that was a deductive consequence of the original hypotheses is still a consequence of the enlarged set.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Nevertheless, the logical system usually corresponds to a subset of first order logic.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We could try to provide axioms that will determine whether each kind of object can fly, but this would make the database very large.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>We have a property applicable to objects or a relation applicable to pairs or triplets, etc.</a>
