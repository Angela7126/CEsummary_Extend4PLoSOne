<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Circumscription allows us to make the known exceptions and to provide for additional exceptions to be added later -- again without changing existing statements.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For example, penguins, ostriches and birds with certain feathers removed can't fly.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We could try to provide axioms that will determine whether each kind of object can fly, but this would make the database very large.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This much is often done by a simpler method -- the closed world assumption discussed by Raymond Reiter.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Most expert systems, including MYCIN, never infer general statements, i.e.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Our ability to use common sense knowledge depends on being able to do common sense reasoning.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>of objects.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
