<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Circumscription allows us to make the known exceptions and to provide for additional exceptions to be added later -- again without changing existing statements.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Deductive reasoning in mathematical logic has the following property --called monotonicity by analogy with similar mathematical concepts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Circumscription allows us to express the assumption that only those objects can fly for which there is a positive statement about it.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ordinary human reasoning does not share this monotonicity property.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>of objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As an example, consider representing the facts about whether an object can fly in a database of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Moreover, more exceptions may be found and even exceptions to the exceptions.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Nonmonotonic reasoning also seems to be involved in human communication.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Now suppose we add additional assumptions.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
