<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Suppose I hire you to build me a bird cage, and you build it without a top, and I refuse to pay on the grounds that my bird might fly away.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Unless I told you that my bird couldn't fly, the judge will side with you.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A judge will side with me.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If you know that I have a car, you may conclude that it is a good idea to ask me for a ride.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If you now learn that the car will be out in half an hour you reverse yourself again.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If you then learn that my car is being fixed (which does not contradict what you knew before), you no longer conclude that you can get a ride.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However, we also have exceptions to the general statement that birds can fly.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Several artificial intelligence researchers, for example Marvin Minsky (1974) have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
