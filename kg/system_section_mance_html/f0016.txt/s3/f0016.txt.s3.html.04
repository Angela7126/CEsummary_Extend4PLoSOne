<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Deductive reasoning in mathematical logic has the following property --called monotonicity by analogy with similar mathematical concepts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Formalized nonmonotonic reasoning turns out to give certain rules of conjecture rather than rules of inference -- their conclusion are appropriate, but may be disconfirmed when more facts are obtained.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>There is often no clear separation in the program between determining what inferences are correct and the strategy for finding the inferences required to solve the problem at hand.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Robert Filman did an interesting thesis on observation in a chess world where many facts that could be obtained by deduction are in fact obtained by observation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Much artificial intelligence inference is not designed to use directly the rules of inference of any of the well known systems of mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Systems provide for inferring a fact about one or two particular objects from other facts about these objects and a general rule containing variables.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Thus there will be positive statements that birds and airplanes can fly and no statement that camels can fly.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We can therefore regard it as a communication convention that if a bird can fly the fact need not be mentioned, but if the bird can't fly and it is relevant, then the fact must be mentioned.</a>
