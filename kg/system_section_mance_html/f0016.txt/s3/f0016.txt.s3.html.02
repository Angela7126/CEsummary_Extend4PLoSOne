<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Deductive reasoning in mathematical logic has the following property --called monotonicity by analogy with similar mathematical concepts.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>There is often no clear separation in the program between determining what inferences are correct and the strategy for finding the inferences required to solve the problem at hand.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Several artificial intelligence researchers, for example Marvin Minsky (1974) have pointed out that intelligent computer programs will have to reason nonmonotonically.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, it has turned out that deduction in mathematical logic can be supplemented by additional modes of nonmonotonic reasoning, which are just as formal as deduction and just as susceptible to mathematical study and computer implementation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Robert Filman did an interesting thesis on observation in a chess world where many facts that could be obtained by deduction are in fact obtained by observation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On the other hand suppose you build it with a top, and I refuse to pay full price on the grounds that my bird is a penguin, and the top is a waste.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Formalized nonmonotonic reasoning turns out to give certain rules of conjecture rather than rules of inference -- their conclusion are appropriate, but may be disconfirmed when more facts are obtained.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Circumscription further constrains the property or relation by requiring it to be true of a minimal set of objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since we don't include negative statements in the database, we could provide for flying camels, if there were any, by adding statements without removing existing statements.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>MYCIN's doesn't require this, but our hypothetical robot physician would have to draw conclusions from a patient's appearance, and computer vision is not ready for it.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Human reasoning also involves obtaining facts by observation of the world, and computer programs also do this.</a>
