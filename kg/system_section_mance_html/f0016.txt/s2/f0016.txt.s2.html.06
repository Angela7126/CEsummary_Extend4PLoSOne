<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This common sense physics is contiguous with scientific physics.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Inventing a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events is a major unsolved problem of AI.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The situation with which MYCIN deals includes the doctor, the patient and the illness.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The fact that MYCIN doesn't give a prognosis is certainly a limitation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We shall discuss various areas of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>What will happen if I give this patient penicillin?</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Typically they match facts about specific objects, e.g.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A production rule embodies a fact only as part of a specific procedure.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>or even "What bad things might happen if I give this patient penicillin?</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
