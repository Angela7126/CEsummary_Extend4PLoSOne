<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This fact can be used to make a noise, to avoid making a noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of a noise.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The fact that MYCIN doesn't give a prognosis is certainly a limitation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is often enough, but it doesn't cover the important case of concurrent events and actions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>I can see part of the front of a person in the audience, and my idea of his shape uses this information to approximate his total shape.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then MYCIN might have to make a plan for getting rid of the patient's fever and verifying that it was gone as a part of the plan for using the antibiotic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, if I spill the glass of water on the podium, everyone knows that the glass will break and the water will spill.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, MYCIN cannot be asked on behalf of the patient or the administration of the hospital when the patient is likely to be ready to go home.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, if a patient has cholera, while the antibiotic is killing the cholera bacteria, the damage to his intestines is causing loss of fluids that are likely to be fatal.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
