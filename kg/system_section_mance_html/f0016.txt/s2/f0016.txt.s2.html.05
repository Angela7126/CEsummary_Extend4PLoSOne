<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This common sense physics is contiguous with scientific physics.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A production rule embodies a fact only as part of a specific procedure.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Typically they match facts about specific objects, e.g.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This fact can be used to make a noise, to avoid making a noise, to explain a noise or to explain the absence of a noise.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Consider the fact that when two objects collide they often make a noise.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>a specific bacterium, against a general rule and get a new fact about those objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It can also be used in specific situations involving a noise but also to understand general phenomena, e.g.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>We shall discuss various areas of common sense knowledge.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Inventing a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events is a major unsolved problem of AI.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>For example, if I spill the glass of water on the podium, everyone knows that the glass will break and the water will spill.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The fact that MYCIN doesn't give a prognosis is certainly a limitation.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>However, this information is not obtained by using the formula for a falling body or the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow.</a>
