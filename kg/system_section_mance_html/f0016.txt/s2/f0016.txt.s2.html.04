<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Inventing a formalism that will conveniently express people's common sense knowledge about concurrent events is a major unsolved problem of AI.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The common sense facts about this are difficult to express but are probably not important in the MYCIN example.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>1) The most salient common sense knowledge concerns situations that change in time as a result of events.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Much present AI research concerns how to represent facts in ways that permit them to be used for a wide variety of purposes.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Of course, the doctors who provided the information built into MYCIN considered the effects of the treatments.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is doubtful that the facts of the common sense world can be represented adequately by production rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>What airline flights there are to Singapore is recorded in the issue of the International Airline Guide current for the proposed flight day.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>4) The ability to represent and use knowledge about knowledge is often required for intelligent behavior.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A major difficulty is in handling the kind of partial knowledge people ordinarily have.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
