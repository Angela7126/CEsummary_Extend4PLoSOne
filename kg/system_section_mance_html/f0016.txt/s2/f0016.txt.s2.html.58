<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since MYCIN doesn't know about the doctor, it might plan the effects of the course of treatment on the patient.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In fact scientific physics is imbedded in common sense physics, because it is common sense physics that tells us what the equation s = 0.5gt^(2) means.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If MYCIN were extended to be a robot physician it would have to know common sense physics and maybe also some scientific physics.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Since MYCIN's actions are advice to the doctor, full planning would have to include information about the effects of MYCIN's output on what the doctor will do.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The most important events are actions, and for a program to plan intelligently, it must be able to determine the effects of its own actions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>However, all systems that I know about give the effects of an event in a situation by describing a new situation that results from the event.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>2) Various formalisms are used in artificial intelligence for representing facts about the effects of actions and other events.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ignoring prognosis is possible because of the specific narrow domain in which MYCIN operates.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>An advanced MYCIN might need to know that a patient won't take a bad tasting medicine unless he is convinced of its necessity.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Perhaps if I knew more about bacterial diseases, I would conclude that their treatment sometimes really does require planning and that lack of planning ability limits MYCIN's utility.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Smith knows about cholera, because he is a specialist in tropical medicine.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This common sense physics is contiguous with scientific physics.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Its rules give the recommended treatment as a function of the information elicited about the patient, but MYCIN makes no prognosis of the effects of the treatment.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The situation with which MYCIN deals includes the doctor, the patient and the illness.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>6) Common sense includes much knowledge whose domain overlaps that of the exact sciences but differs from it epistemologically.</a>
