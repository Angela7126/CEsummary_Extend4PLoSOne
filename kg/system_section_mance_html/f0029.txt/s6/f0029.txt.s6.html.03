<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The SDSS catalog is cross-matched with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B as part of the pipeline processing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>That is what we did for the QsoCatalog table of SDSS DR5 and for a 4-band NDWS pivoted cross-match.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, in SDSS the average inter-object distance is 21".</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, the SDSS QSO candidate objects organize the Target, Spectroscopic, and Best cross-match catalog in this way.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A simple strategy is to build the pairs table and bundles as described above and then build the pivoted cross-match as a join from the bundle table.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Even the SDSS cross-match with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B built pair tables.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In case multiple objects from one catalog qualify, there is usually a "primary" object from that catalog.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match) because this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Rather one must model the object's motion, and then predict where that object will be in the observational field.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If there are no matches in a catalog then that field is filled in with the relational null value.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>These objects cluster into 50M bundles described in the MatchHead table of the SDSS DR5.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The full-outer part of that expression means that there may be zero, one, or many items that match for each bundle.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Often a row containing the primary members is flagged as the primary cross-match of the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>When considering SDSS observations separated by days or years, only very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.</a>
