<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Query 15B of the standard 35 SDSS queries [8] shows how to extend the built-in pipeline cross-match to use the 5-band temporal observations find objects with even greater velocities.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>That query finds ten additional primary fast-moving objects in Data Release 5.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Unfortunately, model uncertainties accumulate with time -- especially for fast moving nearearth objects.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The SDSS is observed in five spectral bands -- each band's observation occurs about a minute after the previous band.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In general, a naive spatial match does not work for fastmoving objects.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The examples discussed so far built match pair tables.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A simple strategy is to build the pairs table and bundles as described above and then build the pivoted cross-match as a join from the bundle table.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Those five measurements allow cross-matching observations of objects with apparent motions of 0.01 to 10 arcminutes per minute (or a comparable number of degrees per day).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
