<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When considering SDSS observations separated by days or years, only very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Near-Earth object apparent motions are typically large and so measurements must be within minutes for the techniques described here to detect object pairs.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If there are no matches in a catalog then that field is filled in with the relational null value.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given the bundle and match tables, the pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs, as follows:</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We call such a cross-match representations a pivoted cross-match (as opposed to a pair-table cross-match) because this representation is the pivot of the pairs table on the match-head and run number.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Most objects are slow-moving so their displacement between observations is small compared to the average inter-object difference.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Of the 16% that are misses, 11% are ephemeral, 0.5% are masked, and 5% are edge because the SDSS overlap areas are typically longnarrow strips.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In case multiple objects from one catalog qualify, there is usually a "primary" object from that catalog.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The examples discussed so far built match pair tables.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For example, the SDSS QSO candidate objects organize the Target, Spectroscopic, and Best cross-match catalog in this way.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Even the SDSS cross-match with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B built pair tables.</a>
