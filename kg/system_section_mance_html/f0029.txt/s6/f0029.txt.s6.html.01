<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In case multiple objects from one catalog qualify, there is usually a "primary" object from that catalog.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The examples discussed so far built match pair tables.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>For example, the SDSS QSO candidate objects organize the Target, Spectroscopic, and Best cross-match catalog in this way.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Even the SDSS cross-match with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B built pair tables.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In general, a naive spatial match does not work for fastmoving objects.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The SDSS catalog is cross-matched with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B as part of the pipeline processing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Often a row containing the primary members is flagged as the primary cross-match of the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If there are no matches in a catalog then that field is filled in with the relational null value.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Expressed in relational terms this is a full-outer spatial join among the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>These objects cluster into 50M bundles described in the MatchHead table of the SDSS DR5.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>About 109M SDSS deblended objects lie in regions observed more than once.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>When considering SDSS observations separated by days or years, only very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Given the bundle and match tables, the pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs, as follows:</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>That query finds ten additional primary fast-moving objects in Data Release 5.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
