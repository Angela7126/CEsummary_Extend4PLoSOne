<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Query 15B of the standard 35 SDSS queries [8] shows how to extend the built-in pipeline cross-match to use the 5-band temporal observations find objects with even greater velocities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Those five measurements allow cross-matching observations of objects with apparent motions of 0.01 to 10 arcminutes per minute (or a comparable number of degrees per day).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But if the object moves more than a few arcseconds per year or if the object density is much higher, then the classification distance technique will hit a combinatorial explosion with too many false-positives.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These objects cluster into 50M bundles described in the MatchHead table of the SDSS DR5.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When considering SDSS observations separated by days or years, only very slow-moving objects can be detected with the cross-match techniques here.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>About 109M SDSS deblended objects lie in regions observed more than once.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For example, the SDSS QSO candidate objects organize the Target, Spectroscopic, and Best cross-match catalog in this way.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A simple strategy is to build the pairs table and bundles as described above and then build the pivoted cross-match as a join from the bundle table.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>That query finds ten additional primary fast-moving objects in Data Release 5.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>That is what we did for the QsoCatalog table of SDSS DR5 and for a 4-band NDWS pivoted cross-match.</a>
