<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The examples discussed so far built match pair tables.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given the bundle and match tables, the pivoted table can be constructed, using zero rather than null for missing objIDs, as follows:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In case multiple objects from one catalog qualify, there is usually a "primary" object from that catalog.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A simple strategy is to build the pairs table and bundles as described above and then build the pivoted cross-match as a join from the bundle table.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Even the SDSS cross-match with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B built pair tables.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>from Match</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>For example, the SDSS QSO candidate objects organize the Target, Spectroscopic, and Best cross-match catalog in this way.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In general, a naive spatial match does not work for fastmoving objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Expressed in relational terms this is a full-outer spatial join among the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The SDSS processing pipeline looks for such objects and records their apparent velocities (in units of degrees per day) in the catalog.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Building pivoted cross-matches is surprisingly difficult.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Often a row containing the primary members is flagged as the primary cross-match of the N catalogs.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But, it is sometimes the case that one wants a match table of the form (x, y, z) built from three surveys X, Y, Z where the match elements are the corresponding elements of the survey -- in general the problem involves more than three surveys or observations, but three is enough to demonstrate the issues.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>insert Pivoted (bundleID, x, y, z)</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The SDSS catalog is cross-matched with FIRST, RC3, ROSAT, Stetson, and USNO-B as part of the pipeline processing.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If there are no matches in a catalog then that field is filled in with the relational null value.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>That is what we did for the QsoCatalog table of SDSS DR5 and for a 4-band NDWS pivoted cross-match.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>That query finds ten additional primary fast-moving objects in Data Release 5.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>select distinct bundleID, objID1, run1</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>These objects cluster into 50M bundles described in the MatchHead table of the SDSS DR5.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
