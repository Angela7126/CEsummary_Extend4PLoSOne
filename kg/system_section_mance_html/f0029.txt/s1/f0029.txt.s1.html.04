<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Given a point in one run, the probability in finding another point at a separation r in another run, given perfect accuracy is the sum of a Dirac delta for the object plus the contribution from a spatial correlation function (from clustering) and a random Poisson component.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Some studies are interested in moving objects and other studies are working with data collected over an epoch where the earth's observational position affects the object's relative position.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>run1 is optical and run2 is radio or Xray), or O1 is a variable or transient object which varied below the detection threshold in run2, or O1 moved more than the classification distance between the two observations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The position uncertainty or astrometric precision is often a constant for all objects of an observation, but when comparing data from different instruments or from times with different seeing, the position uncertainties may differ.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The technique described here can handle slow-moving objects -- where the relative motion during the observational epoch is small compared to the average distance among objects.</a>
