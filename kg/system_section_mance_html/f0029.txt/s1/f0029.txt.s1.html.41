<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>These convolutions will broaden the Dirac delta.</a>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Two objects are said to match if they come from different runs and if their positions differ by less than their classification distance.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When comparing runs from different instruments the ephemeral issues may be even more dramatic -- the object may not be visible in the second instrument because it does not radiate in that spectral band, or the two instruments may have very different sensitivity.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
