<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>After the coarse spatial match, different astronomers may want to use different morphological and attribute tests to detect spurious matches where a moving object has occluded or changed the attributes of some object or to tease apart adjacent members of a binary system.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given a point in one run, the probability in finding another point at a separation r in another run, given perfect accuracy is the sum of a Dirac delta for the object plus the contribution from a spatial correlation function (from clustering) and a random Poisson component.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A rigorous statistical argument, based on mean density and other parameters can recommend an optimal Bayes classification distance.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Our goal is to compute a table Match( run1, objectID1, run2, objectID2, hitOrMiss) Where the hitOrMiss field takes on one of the values Hit, Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some studies are interested in moving objects and other studies are working with data collected over an epoch where the earth's observational position affects the object's relative position.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The position uncertainty or astrometric precision is often a constant for all objects of an observation, but when comparing data from different instruments or from times with different seeing, the position uncertainties may differ.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
