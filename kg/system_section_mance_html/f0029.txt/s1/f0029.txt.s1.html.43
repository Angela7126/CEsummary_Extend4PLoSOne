<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>O1 was on the edge of the run2 footprint and so not all its pixels were observed.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The observational errors, motions, and sizes all create their own errors, which must be convolved with this distribution.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When comparing runs from different instruments the ephemeral issues may be even more dramatic -- the object may not be visible in the second instrument because it does not radiate in that spectral band, or the two instruments may have very different sensitivity.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>When the objectID1-run2 pair is a miss, then objectID2 is zero, and the hitOrMiss flag suggests why (Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge)</a>
