<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Run2 misses may be caused by ephemeral, masking, or edge effects.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Our goal is to compute a table Match( run1, objectID1, run2, objectID2, hitOrMiss) Where the hitOrMiss field takes on one of the values Hit, Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>but it chose the high classification distance, 10x the astrometric precision, to include slowly-moving objects in the cross-match.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Masked:</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>When the objectID1-run2 pair is a miss, then objectID2 is zero, and the hitOrMiss flag suggests why (Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge)</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, SDSS Data Release 5 [6] chose a classification distance of 1.0".</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A rigorous statistical argument, based on mean density and other parameters can recommend an optimal Bayes classification distance.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The position uncertainty or astrometric precision is often a constant for all objects of an observation, but when comparing data from different instruments or from times with different seeing, the position uncertainties may differ.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Some studies are interested in moving objects and other studies are working with data collected over an epoch where the earth's observational position affects the object's relative position.</a>
