<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If only stationary objects are to be matched, then the classification distance can be a small multiple of the maximum of the two object's circular rms position errors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given two runs that overlap, if object O1 observed in run1 matches object O2 in run2, we call the pair an O1-run2 hit.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When comparing runs from different instruments the ephemeral issues may be even more dramatic -- the object may not be visible in the second instrument because it does not radiate in that spectral band, or the two instruments may have very different sensitivity.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Given several observations of the sky, called runs, astronomers often want to cross-match all the observations of each object from all runs that observed that object.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A typical first step is to process the runs to make an object catalog.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the SDSS about 84% of the match pairs avoid these problems, but 11% of the matches are ephemeral, about 0.5% are masked, and because the SDSS overlap areas are typically long-narrow strips, about 5% are edge objects.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>O1 is at the detection threshold and the seeing was good in run1 but not as good in run2 or O1 may be invisible if run2 is a different kind of instrument (e.g.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the SDSS were in the galactic plane, not to mention the galactic center, it would have very crowded fields, and would have a combinatorial explosion using such a large classification distance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
