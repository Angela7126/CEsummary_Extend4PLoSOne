<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This article is about when we're right or almost right in saying these things, and when it's a good idea to think of machines that way.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It won't be necessary for most people to know very much about how they work internally, but what we will have to know about them in order to use them is more complex than what we need to know about electric lights and telephones.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Ever since Descartes, philosophically minded people have wrestled with the question of whether it is possible for machines to think.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>When we interact with computers and other machines, we often use language ordinarily used for talking about people.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Is this an all-or-nothing question, or can we say that some machines do some of these things and not others, or that they do them to some extent?</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>According to some authorities, to use these words, the language of the mind, to talk about machines is to commit the error of anthropomorphism.</a>
