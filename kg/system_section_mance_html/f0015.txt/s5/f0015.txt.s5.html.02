<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>I suppose some philosophers, psychologists, and English teachers would maintain that the blanket manufacturer is guilty of anthropomorphism and some will claim that great harm can come from thus ascribing to machines qualities which only humans can have.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Perhaps Honeywell discovers that these compromises should be modified according to a social rank formula devised by its psychologists and determined by patterns of speech loudness.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In ten or twenty years Minneapolis-Honeywell, which makes many thermostats today, may try to sell you a really fancy home temperature control system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>He has ascribed the mental quality of wanting to the dog without claiming that the dog thinks like a human and can form out of its parts the thought, 'I want to go out'.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>When several are in the room it makes what it considers a compromise adjustment taking account who has most recently had to suffer having the room climate different from what he prefers.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Here's a somewhat fanciful example of a machine that might someday be encountered in daily life with more substantial mental qualities.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
