<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It also isn't shorthand for a specific prediction of what the dog is likely to do next.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did, because there are many ways of knowing that a dog wants to go out.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It doesn't commit the person who said it to an elaborate view of the mind of a dog.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It may believe that the room is too hot, or that it is too cold, or that it is ok.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The example of the thermostat is a very simple one.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>for example, it does not believe that it is a thermostat.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It has beliefs like, 'There's enough money in the account,' and 'I don't give out that much money'.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The example is extreme, because most people don't need the word 'think' to understand how a thermostatic control works.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft, it will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>And if all we wanted to think about were zero and one, we wouldn't bother with the concept of number.</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>He has ascribed the mental quality of wanting to the dog without claiming that the dog thinks like a human and can form out of its parts the thought, 'I want to go out'.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If we had only thermostats to think about, we wouldn't bother with the concept of belief at all.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>These rules say nothing about the meaning of the characters, just how to compute with them.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The rules tell him how to extract certain parts of a sequence of characters, how to re-arrange them, and how finally to send back another sequence of characters.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>It is useful because of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.</a>
