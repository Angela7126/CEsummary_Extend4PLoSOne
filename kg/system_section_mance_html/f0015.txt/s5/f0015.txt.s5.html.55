<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is analogous to a computer, which only obeys its programming language, but can be programmed such that one can communicate with it in a different programming language, or in English.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>1) It's trying to do the right thing, but it can't because the valve is stuck.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>2) It regards Grandpa as more important than me, and it is keeping the room hot in case he comes in.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>3) It confuses me with Grandpa.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>4) It has forgotten what climate I like.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Confronted with an uncomfortable room you form any of the following hypotheses depending on what other information you had.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>But then it should complain.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the control is placed on the window sill in a cold draft, it will 'think' the entire room is cold and will heat up your bed so it will be too hot.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The example is extreme, because most people don't need the word 'think' to understand how a thermostatic control works.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>And if all we wanted to think about were zero and one, we wouldn't bother with the concept of number.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>If we had only thermostats to think about, we wouldn't bother with the concept of belief at all.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It is useful because of its connection with all of these things and because what it says about the dog corresponds in an informative way with similar statements about people.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The statement isn't shorthand for something the dog did, because there are many ways of knowing that a dog wants to go out.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
