<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If the control is placed on a radiator or radiant heated floors, it will 'think' the entire room is hot and will lower your blanket temperature, making your bed too cold.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I suppose some philosophers, psychologists, and English teachers would maintain that the blanket manufacturer is guilty of anthropomorphism and some will claim that great harm can come from thus ascribing to machines qualities which only humans can have.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Perhaps Honeywell discovers that these compromises should be modified according to a social rank formula devised by its psychologists and determined by patterns of speech loudness.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
