<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Electron and quark are terms in a complicated theory that predicts the results of experiments.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Nevertheless we can give approximate criteria for some specific properties relating them to the more implicit properties of believing and wanting.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Tries -- This is important in understanding machines that have a variety of ways of achieving a goal including possibly ways that we don't know about.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Similarly the physicist doesn't give a definition of electron or quark.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>an intention may be caused by a variety of stimuli and predispositions and may result in action or be frustrated in a variety of ways.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In general we cannot give definitions, because the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Like most mental concepts, intention is an intermediate in the causal chain;</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A child learns to ascribe wants and beliefs to others in a complex way that he never learns to encapsulate in definitions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the machine may do something we don't know about but that can laterbe explained in relation to a goal, we have no choice but to use 'is trying' or some synonym to explain the behavior.</a>
