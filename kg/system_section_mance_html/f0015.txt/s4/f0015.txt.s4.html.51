<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Some of the above attributes of human self-consciousness are easy to program.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>For example, it is not hard to make a program look at itself, and many AI programs do look at parts of themselves.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, many present and future programs can best be described as partially self-conscious.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Others are more difficult.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Also animals cannot be shown to have more than a few.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In general we cannot give definitions, because the concepts form a system that we fit as a whole to phenomena.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Intends -- We say that a machine intends to do something if we can regard it as believing that it will attempt to do it.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the machine may do something we don't know about but that can laterbe explained in relation to a goal, we have no choice but to use 'is trying' or some synonym to explain the behavior.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Human self-consciousness involves at least the following:</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Similarly the physicist doesn't give a definition of electron or quark.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Electron and quark are terms in a complicated theory that predicts the results of experiments.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Like most mental concepts, intention is an intermediate in the causal chain;</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Tries -- This is important in understanding machines that have a variety of ways of achieving a goal including possibly ways that we don't know about.</a>
