<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Current AI approaches to ascribing specific mental qualities use the symbolism of mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Anthropomorphism is the ascription of human characteristics to things not human.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We understand human mental processes only slightly better than a fish understands swimming.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We need not ascribe to the teller machine the thought, 'There's no money in his account,' as its reason to refuse to give me cash.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Certain formulas of this logic are then axioms giving relations between the concepts and conditions for ascribing them.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Present machines have almost no emotional qualities, and, in my opinion, it would be a bad idea to give them any.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Since I advocate some anthropomorphism, I'd better explain what I consider good and bad anthropomorphism.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In that symbolism, speaking technically, a suitable collection of functions and predicates must be given.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It's difficult to be rigorous about whether a machine really 'knows', 'thinks', etc., because we're hard put to define these things.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Second what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.</a>
