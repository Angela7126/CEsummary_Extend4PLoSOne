<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Second what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Present machines have almost no emotional qualities, and, in my opinion, it would be a bad idea to give them any.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It helps understand what they will do, how our actions will affect them, how to compare them with ourselves and how to design them.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>These axioms are used by reasoning programs as part of the process whereby the program decides what to do.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We have enough trouble figuring out our duties to our fellow humans and to animals without creating a bunch of robots with qualities that would allow anyone to feel sorry for them or would allow them to feel sorry for themselves.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It's difficult to be rigorous about whether a machine really 'knows', 'thinks', etc., because we're hard put to define these things.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>I may make statements about it like, 'It won't give me any cash because it knows there's no money in my account,' or, 'It knows who I am because I gave it my secret number'.</a>
