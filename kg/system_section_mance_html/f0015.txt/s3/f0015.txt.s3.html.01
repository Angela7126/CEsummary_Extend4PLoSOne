<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Current AI approaches to ascribing specific mental qualities use the symbolism of mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Certain formulas of this logic are then axioms giving relations between the concepts and conditions for ascribing them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In that symbolism, speaking technically, a suitable collection of functions and predicates must be given.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The reason for ascribing mental qualities and mental processes to machines is the same as for ascribing them to other people.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These axioms are used by reasoning programs as part of the process whereby the program decides what to do.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The formalisms require too much explanation to be included in this article, but some of the criteria are easily given in English.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We understand human mental processes only slightly better than a fish understands swimming.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Second what the user knows about the machine can often best be expressed using mental terms.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>It is especially important to have what is called in AI an epistemologically adequate system.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Present machines have almost no emotional qualities, and, in my opinion, it would be a bad idea to give them any.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Namely, the language must be able to express the information our program can actually get about a person's or machine's 'state of mind' -- not just what might be obtainable if the neurophysiology of the human or the design of the machine were more accessible.</a>
