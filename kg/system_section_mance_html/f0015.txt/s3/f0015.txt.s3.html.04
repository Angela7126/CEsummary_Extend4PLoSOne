<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Current AI approaches to ascribing specific mental qualities use the symbolism of mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We understand human mental processes only slightly better than a fish understands swimming.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) are interested in the use of mental terms to describe machines for two reasons.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Certain formulas of this logic are then axioms giving relations between the concepts and conditions for ascribing them.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
