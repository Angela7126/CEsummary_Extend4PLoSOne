<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A knowledge node (scientist) can deliver knowledge to its peers by forwarding knowledge it has received (for example, forwarding an answer to the node that forwarded the query), or by passing on knowledge it generates (for example, send the answer to the querying node directly).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An effective knowledge flow network enables a research team to be very powerful in generating new knowledge if every node can innovate and output new knowledge to appropriate members.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Invisible knowledge flow networks self-organize and evolve continuously and interact with each other through flows to form an autonomous knowledge space for providing advanced knowledge services.</a>
