<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Knowledge flows along semantic links such as "co-author" and "supervise" prior to other links to constitute a knowledge map.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The knowledge dissemination model resembles the spread of infectious diseases.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Research has shown the contact network and the virus spread model determine the spread of epidemics [11], so the evolution of the contact network influences an epidemic.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>These semantic links constitute a scientific semantic map [10].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The future interconnection environment will synergize data flows, control flows, and knowledge flows to support appropriate on-demand service flows [11, 12], from which knowledge flow networks will create a live knowledge space that develops independently of machines.</a>
