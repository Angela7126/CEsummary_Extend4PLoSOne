<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>By extracting and mining from scientific data, activities, and documents of an area;</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This service can recommend references by retrieving documents from the Web and digital libraries, ranking them according to their citation rates and the roles of the authors, and tracing and analyzing their citation networks to show the references as a network rather than as a list.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>analyzing the relationships between results to enrich a knowledge flow network;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and tracing its evolution, an e-science environment can provide scientists with the following services:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Based on the evolution of relevant knowledge flow networks, this service enables scientists to simulate and estimate the development of a discipline, and thus helps them plan research.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>if there is a citation path in each direction between two articles, then the authors share common interest and knowledge.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The network can be a hierarchy that enables people to zoom in and out of the research area.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>By extracting comments and comparisons of the cited articles and then organizing them according to the time of publication, discovers and displays how the area has developed as a research literature.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This service can discover global interest groups by finding two types of citation relationship.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This service enables scientists to detect the emergence of a new area from the convergence of two areas, especially a mature area and a relevant new area.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The system can display users' personal knowledge flow networks by finding their citations and their co-authors' citations, classifying the articles involved by discipline and chronology, expressing the category semantics for advanced services, linking the categories with the citations, and revealing knowledge flows using the citation network.</a>
