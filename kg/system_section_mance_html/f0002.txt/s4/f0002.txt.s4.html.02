<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The environment records information flow such as email within a research team, extracts useful information flows, analyzes common interests and cooperation relations, and displays the evolution of the flows to help assess the teamwork's effectiveness, for example, whether team members' changing interests match their tasks.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Based on the evolution of relevant knowledge flow networks, this service enables scientists to simulate and estimate the development of a discipline, and thus helps them plan research.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This service can help scientists select peers by finding the dense cliques in knowledge flow networks by looking at the statistical results and distribution of authors, articles, and citations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This service can recommend references by retrieving documents from the Web and digital libraries, ranking them according to their citation rates and the roles of the authors, and tracing and analyzing their citation networks to show the references as a network rather than as a list.</a>
