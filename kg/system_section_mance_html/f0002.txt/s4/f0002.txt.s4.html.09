<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Based on the evolution of relevant knowledge flow networks, this service enables scientists to simulate and estimate the development of a discipline, and thus helps them plan research.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This service can help scientists select peers by finding the dense cliques in knowledge flow networks by looking at the statistical results and distribution of authors, articles, and citations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The system can display users' personal knowledge flow networks by finding their citations and their co-authors' citations, classifying the articles involved by discipline and chronology, expressing the category semantics for advanced services, linking the categories with the citations, and revealing knowledge flows using the citation network.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Scientists can further find out who initiated a knowledge flow in an area, their roles in a flow, changes in their status, the effect of knowledge flows on different areas, and the evolution of a knowledge flow.</a>
