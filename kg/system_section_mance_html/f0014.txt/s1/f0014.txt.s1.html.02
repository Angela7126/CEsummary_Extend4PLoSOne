<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since any test may be regarded as being performed by a Turing machine, this means that welldefined intellectual problems may be regarded as those of inverting functions and partial functions defined by Turing machines.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This paper deals with the problem of designing a Turing machine which, when confronted by the number pair (m,r), computes as efficiently as possible a function g(m,r) such that fm(g(m,r)) = r.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In case the proposed solution is a solution, the test must confirm this in a finite number of steps.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In fact, it has been shown that the existence of g(m,r) is an undecidable question in that there does not exist a Turing machine which will eventually come to a stop and print a 1 if g(m,r) does not exist.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In spite of this, it is easy to show that a Turing machine exists which will compute a g(m,r) if such exists.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It corresponds to looking for a proof of a conjecture by checking in some order all possible English essays.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Consider the problem of designing a machine to solve well-defined intellectual problems.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Our problem does not end once we have found this procedure for computing g(m,r) because this procedure is extremely inefficient.</a>
