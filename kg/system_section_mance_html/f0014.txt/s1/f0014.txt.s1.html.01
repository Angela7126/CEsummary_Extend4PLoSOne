<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In case the proposed solution is a solution, the test must confirm this in a finite number of steps.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Consider the problem of designing a machine to solve well-defined intellectual problems.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Since any test may be regarded as being performed by a Turing machine, this means that welldefined intellectual problems may be regarded as those of inverting functions and partial functions defined by Turing machines.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the proposed solution is not correct, we may either require that the test indicate this in a finite number of steps or else allow it to go on indefinitely.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We call a problem well-defined if there is a test which can be applied to a proposed solution.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This paper deals with the problem of designing a Turing machine which, when confronted by the number pair (m,r), computes as efficiently as possible a function g(m,r) such that fm(g(m,r)) = r.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Let fm(n) be the partial function computed by the mth Turing machine.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In spite of this, it is easy to show that a Turing machine exists which will compute a g(m,r) if such exists.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In fact, it has been shown that the existence of g(m,r) is an undecidable question in that there does not exist a Turing machine which will eventually come to a stop and print a 1 if g(m,r) does not exist.</a>
