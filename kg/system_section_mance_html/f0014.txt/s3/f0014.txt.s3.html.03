<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The straightforward approach would be to try to develop a formalized theory of Turing machines in which length of a computation is defined and then try to get a decision procedure for this formal theory.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Of course, it is then necessary to be able to express all other relevant properties as functions of the new enumeration.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is based on the plausible idea that, in searching for the solution to a problem, the given data should be taken into account.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This is based on the idea that the best procedure is more likely to be recursively simple, rather than merely to have a low number in the ordering.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(To be regarded as a current estimate of their validity and relevance, etc.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This suggests first of all that a function fk(x,y) be tried out first on simpler problems known to have simple solutions before very many steps of the computation fk(m,r) are carried out.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Here we remark that a property is useful mainly when it permits a new enumeration of the objects possessing it and not merely a test which can be applied.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This is known to be a hopeless task.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>For our purposes a formal theory is a decidable predicate V(p,t1,...,tk->t) which is to be regarded as meaning that p is a proof that the statements t1,...,tk imply the statement t in the theory.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The only kind of concrete proposition which we shall mention for now is P(m,n,r,k) meaning fm(n) = r in a computation of length u'\u2264' k.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In order to get around the fact that all formal systems which are anywhere near adequate for describing recursive function theory are incomplete, we avoid restriction to any one of them by introducing the notion of a formal theory (not for the first time, of course.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The theories and interpretations of them can be enumerated.</a>
