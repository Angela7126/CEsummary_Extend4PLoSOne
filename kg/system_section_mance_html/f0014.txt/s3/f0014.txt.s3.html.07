<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Systems much simpler than Turing machine theory have been shown to have unsolvable decision procedures.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The straightforward approach would be to try to develop a formalized theory of Turing machines in which length of a computation is defined and then try to get a decision procedure for this formal theory.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>More generally, the enumeration of partial recursive functions should give an early place to compositions of the functions which have already appeared.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An interpretation of a formal theory is a computable function i(t) mapping a class of statements of the theory into statements of other theories or concrete propositions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>With the enumeration the objects not possessing the property need not even be examined.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Of course, exhaustiveness in examining for usefulness can be attained for any effectively enumerable class of objects simply by going through the enumeration.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We now return to the question of how to design machines which make use of information concerning the structure of Turing machines.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A function of their Godel numbers is called a status function.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>First, let fk(x,y) be the function of two variables computed by the kth Turing machine.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Here we remark that a property is useful mainly when it permits a new enumeration of the objects possessing it and not merely a test which can be applied.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>What is needed is a general procedure which ensures that all relevant concepts which can be computed with are examined and that the irrelevant are eliminated as rapidly as possible.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In order to get around the fact that all formal systems which are anywhere near adequate for describing recursive function theory are incomplete, we avoid restriction to any one of them by introducing the notion of a formal theory (not for the first time, of course.</a>
