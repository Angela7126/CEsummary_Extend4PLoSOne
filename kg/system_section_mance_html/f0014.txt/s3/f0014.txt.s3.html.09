<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>More generally, the enumeration of partial recursive functions should give an early place to compositions of the functions which have already appeared.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The next complication which suggests itself is to revise the order in which recursive functions are considered.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Systems much simpler than Turing machine theory have been shown to have unsolvable decision procedures.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>With the enumeration the objects not possessing the property need not even be examined.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Of course, exhaustiveness in examining for usefulness can be attained for any effectively enumerable class of objects simply by going through the enumeration.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The straightforward approach would be to try to develop a formalized theory of Turing machines in which length of a computation is defined and then try to get a decision procedure for this formal theory.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>First, let fk(x,y) be the function of two variables computed by the kth Turing machine.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Here we remark that a property is useful mainly when it permits a new enumeration of the objects possessing it and not merely a test which can be applied.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A function of their Godel numbers is called a status function.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Our procedure consists in trying the numbers fk(m,r) in order (again diagonalizing to avoid computations which don't end.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>What is needed is a general procedure which ensures that all relevant concepts which can be computed with are examined and that the irrelevant are eliminated as rapidly as possible.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>However, enumerative methods are always inefficient.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Of course, it is then necessary to be able to express all other relevant properties as functions of the new enumeration.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The difficulty with the afore-mentioned methods and their elaborations is that they have no concept of partial success.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>An interpretation of a formal theory is a computable function i(t) mapping a class of statements of the theory into statements of other theories or concrete propositions.</a>
