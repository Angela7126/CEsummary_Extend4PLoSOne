<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In order to get around the fact that all formal systems which are anywhere near adequate for describing recursive function theory are incomplete, we avoid restriction to any one of them by introducing the notion of a formal theory (not for the first time, of course.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>More generally, the enumeration of partial recursive functions should give an early place to compositions of the functions which have already appeared.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Intuitively it seems that each successive complication improves the performance on difficult problems, but imposes a delay in getting started.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The straightforward approach would be to try to develop a formalized theory of Turing machines in which length of a computation is defined and then try to get a decision procedure for this formal theory.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>An interpretation of a formal theory is a computable function i(t) mapping a class of statements of the theory into statements of other theories or concrete propositions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Systems much simpler than Turing machine theory have been shown to have unsolvable decision procedures.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>An action scheme is a computation rule which computes from a status function (its Godel number) a new status function, perhaps gives an estimate of g(m,r) if it has determined this, and computes a new action scheme.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Of course, exhaustiveness in examining for usefulness can be attained for any effectively enumerable class of objects simply by going through the enumeration.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>What is needed is a general procedure which ensures that all relevant concepts which can be computed with are examined and that the irrelevant are eliminated as rapidly as possible.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>For our purposes a formal theory is a decidable predicate V(p,t1,...,tk->t) which is to be regarded as meaning that p is a proof that the statements t1,...,tk imply the statement t in the theory.</a>
