<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are certain difficulties here connected with the fact that the rate of computation is limited if the tape of the universal machine is finite dimensional, and hence the rate should probably be defined with respect to a machine whose tape is infinite dimensional but each square of which has at most two states and which has only two internal states.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It will be made at least plausible that a machine with Q internal states and S symbols should be considered as making about (1/2)log(QS) elementary steps per step of computation and hence the number of steps in a computation should be multiplied by this factor to get the length of the computation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Let this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The most obvious idea is to say that if T1 and T2 are two Turing machines each computing a g(m,r), then for a particular m and r the more efficient one is the one which carries out the computation in the fewest steps.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, this won't do since for any Turing machine there is another one which does k steps of the original machine in one step.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(Shannon shows elsewhere in these studies that it is possible to reduce the number of internal states to two at the cost of increasing the number of symbols and reducing the speed.</a>
