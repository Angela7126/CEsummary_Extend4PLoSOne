<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are certain difficulties here connected with the fact that the rate of computation is limited if the tape of the universal machine is finite dimensional, and hence the rate should probably be defined with respect to a machine whose tape is infinite dimensional but each square of which has at most two states and which has only two internal states.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It will be made at least plausible that a machine with Q internal states and S symbols should be considered as making about (1/2)log(QS) elementary steps per step of computation and hence the number of steps in a computation should be multiplied by this factor to get the length of the computation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Let this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Any machine can be modified into such a machine by adding to it facilities for testing a conclusion and having it spend a small fraction of its time trying the integers in order).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Having now an idea of what should be meant by the length L(m,r,T) of a particular computation of g(m,r) by the machine T, we can return to the question of comparing two Turing machines.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(Shannon shows elsewhere in these studies that it is possible to reduce the number of internal states to two at the cost of increasing the number of symbols and reducing the speed.</a>
