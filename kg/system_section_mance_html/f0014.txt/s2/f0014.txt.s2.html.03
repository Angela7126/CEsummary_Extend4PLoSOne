<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Having now an idea of what should be meant by the length L(m,r,T) of a particular computation of g(m,r) by the machine T, we can return to the question of comparing two Turing machines.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, it is not so easy to give a function which gives an over-all estimate of the efficiency of a machine at computing g(m,r).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The most obvious idea is to say that if T1 and T2 are two Turing machines each computing a g(m,r), then for a particular m and r the more efficient one is the one which carries out the computation in the fewest steps.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(Otherwise, a machine could be described for determining whether the computation of fm(n) terminates.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For any universal Turing machine there is a standard way of recoding on it the computation performed by the given machine.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For now, we only remark that dimensionality is meant to be lim_(n->inf)(log(V_n))/(log(n)) where Vn is the number of squares accessible to a given one in n steps.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Let this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It will be made at least plausible that a machine with Q internal states and S symbols should be considered as making about (1/2)log(QS) elementary steps per step of computation and hence the number of steps in a computation should be multiplied by this factor to get the length of the computation.</a>
