<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are certain difficulties here connected with the fact that the rate of computation is limited if the tape of the universal machine is finite dimensional, and hence the rate should probably be defined with respect to a machine whose tape is infinite dimensional but each square of which has at most two states and which has only two internal states.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(Shannon shows elsewhere in these studies that it is possible to reduce the number of internal states to two at the cost of increasing the number of symbols and reducing the speed.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Let this computation be recoded on a fixed universal Turing machine and count the number of steps in the new computation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The most obvious idea is to say that if T1 and T2 are two Turing machines each computing a g(m,r), then for a particular m and r the more efficient one is the one which carries out the computation in the fewest steps.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For any universal Turing machine there is a standard way of recoding on it the computation performed by the given machine.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Hence we offer the following revised definition of the length of a computation performed by a Turing machine.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This requires a mild generalization of the concept of Turing machines.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is probably also possible to increase the speed by increasing the number of internal states, though this is not so easy to show.</a>
