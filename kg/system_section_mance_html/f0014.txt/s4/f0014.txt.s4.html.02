<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This equivalence should not be made because a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The point is to do this so that the procedures we offer are general (will eventually solve every solvable problem) and also are improvable by the methods built into the machine.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In determining a procedure which has action schemes, theories, etc., we are imposing our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The reader should note that a formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Perhaps, a machine should be regarded as thinking if and only if its behavior can most concisely be described by statements, including those of the form "It now believes Pythagoras' theorem.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, an action scheme might modify the status of a whole class of theories simultaneously in some systematic way.</a>
