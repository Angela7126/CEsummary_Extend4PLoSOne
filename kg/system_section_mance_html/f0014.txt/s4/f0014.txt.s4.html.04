<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A status function would consist primarily of estimates of the validity of the separate theories and would place theories which had not been examined in an "unknown" category.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The reader should note that a formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This equivalence should not be made because a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>An important merit of a particular theory might be that in it the verification of a proof at the correlate of a certain concrete proposition is much shorter than thecomputation of the concrete proposition, i.e., shorter than k in P(m,n,r,k).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, an action scheme might modify the status of a whole class of theories simultaneously in some systematic way.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The point is to do this so that the procedures we offer are general (will eventually solve every solvable problem) and also are improvable by the methods built into the machine.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The relation of certain action schemes to certain theories might warrant our regarding certain statements in them as being normative, i.e., of the form "the next axiom scheme should be no.</a>
