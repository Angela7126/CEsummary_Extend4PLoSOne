<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The reader should note that a formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In determining a procedure which has action schemes, theories, etc., we are imposing our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, an action scheme might modify the status of a whole class of theories simultaneously in some systematic way.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Except for the concrete proposition none of the statements of a formal theory have necessary interpretations which are stateable in advance.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This equivalence should not be made because a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The relation of certain action schemes to certain theories might warrant our regarding certain statements in them as being normative, i.e., of the form "the next axiom scheme should be no.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A status function would consist primarily of estimates of the validity of the separate theories and would place theories which had not been examined in an "unknown" category.</a>
