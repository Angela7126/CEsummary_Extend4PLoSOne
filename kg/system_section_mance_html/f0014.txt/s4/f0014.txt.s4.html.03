<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This equivalence should not be made because a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>However, an action scheme might modify the status of a whole class of theories simultaneously in some systematic way.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The relation of certain action schemes to certain theories might warrant our regarding certain statements in them as being normative, i.e., of the form "the next axiom scheme should be no.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In determining a procedure which has action schemes, theories, etc., we are imposing our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This would not be the case for a phonograph record of a proof of Pythagoras1 theorem.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>An important merit of a particular theory might be that in it the verification of a proof at the correlate of a certain concrete proposition is much shorter than thecomputation of the concrete proposition, i.e., shorter than k in P(m,n,r,k).</a>
