<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In determining a procedure which has action schemes, theories, etc., we are imposing our ideas of the structure of the problem on the machine.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus, knowledge can be interpreted as a predisposition to act in certain ways under given conditions, and an action scheme can be interpreted as a belief that certain action is appropriate under these conditions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The reader should note that a formal equivalence could probably be established between formal theories and certain action schemes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This equivalence should not be made because a simple theory may have a very complicated interpretation as an action scheme and conversely, and in this inversion problem the simplicity of an object is one of its most important properties.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The point is to do this so that the procedures we offer are general (will eventually solve every solvable problem) and also are improvable by the methods built into the machine.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In particular, if there exist more or less satisfactory answers with no way of deciding whether an answer already obtained can be improved on a reasonable time, the problem is not well-defined.</a>
