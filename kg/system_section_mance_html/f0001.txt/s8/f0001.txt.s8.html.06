<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(3) Generating a small network of pictures from a large set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) Generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Discovering the semantic link networks that the pictures involved in can help automatic summarization.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(2) Selecting one picture to represent a set of related pictures.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The problem of summarizing texts, pictures, and videos can be generalized as one problem.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Select the representative tags of these pictures, search relevant texts according to these tags (or select the texts that contain or link to these pictures), and then summarize these texts.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The summarization of pictures also helps incorporate appropriate pictures into the summary as discussed before.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The establishment of the semantic links relies on the relations between their tags determined by existing texts and links and the categories of pictures.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>A solution to implement this idea is to make use of existing summaries made by humans and the corresponding pictures in the networks of pictures, tags, summaries, source texts and people who involved in forming and using these things.</a>
