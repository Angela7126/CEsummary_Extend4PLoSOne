<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Humans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements, but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It becomes more and more important with wide use of digital cameras in our society for security, news, entertainment, education, advertisements, etc.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Modern cameras can generate pictures with time and location information, so the summarization of pictures can be carried out in a space of four dimensions:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, summarization in these areas has the reasons of summarization and the correctness guarantee of using summaries.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Humans can make a humanized summarization because they have experience and knowledge out of pictures.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>There have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures with the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years due to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In some areas like CAD, graph components have formal specifications.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The key problem is to select a better picture from the candidates that have the same projections on the dimensions of time, location and topic, because the semantic links between pictures may be poor.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For particular applications like football games [Ekin, 2003], important sections such as slow-motion segments and goals in game are known by humans, so it is easy to find the important sections.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The patterns of events, conversations, and behaviors should be characterized to get semantically meaningful summaries of complicated video contents [Tewfik, 1999].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Current online movies contain subtitles, which provide a new condition for making summarization of videos through natural language processing.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Making abstraction on graph components can be done through mathematical derivation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Automatic video summarization is to enable machines to generate a clip of a long video or a set of long videos.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
