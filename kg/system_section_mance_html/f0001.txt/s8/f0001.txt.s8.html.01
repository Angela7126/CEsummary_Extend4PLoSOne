<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Transformation between different data structures can help summarization [Zhuge, 2008].</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Summarizing data streams supports more general fundamental queries on data streams such as point, range, and inner-product queries [G.Cormode and S.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Fuzzy set was used to summarize data structures [Yager, 1982] [G.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A unified representation such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) helps transformation and unify summarization.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Automatic video summarization is to enable machines to generate a clip of a long video or a set of long videos.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The summarization of relational database takes table as input and produces a reduced version of the table through rewriting and generalization.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Video summarization concerns the simplification of motion.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Summarizing a video requires machines to identify the essential characteristics of the video.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The Resource Space Model supports multi-dimensional generalization and specialization [Zhuge, 2008, 2012].</a>

<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>To realize more meaningful video summarization, it is important to represent body language, spoken language, emotion, habit and psychological activities in microscopic.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(1) Generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
