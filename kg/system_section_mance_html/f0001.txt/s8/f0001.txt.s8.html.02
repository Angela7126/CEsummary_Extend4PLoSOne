<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In macroscopic, it is important to represent the background of the video and relevant social structure, interests, fashion, rules, regulations, laws and culture of society in a summarization system.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>To realize more meaningful video summarization, it is important to represent body language, spoken language, emotion, habit and psychological activities in microscopic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A unified representation such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) helps transformation and unify summarization.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>and, (2) focusing on moving pictures (moving storyboard), a collection of image sequences, and the corresponding audio abstract extracted from the original sequence, which results in a short video clip.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There have been more and more real requirements of summarizing pictures with the explosion of digital pictures online in recently years due to the wide deployment of cameras and popularity of smart phones.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A solution to implement this idea is to make use of existing summaries made by humans and the corresponding pictures in the networks of pictures, tags, summaries, source texts and people who involved in forming and using these things.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Graphs are the generalization of various real networks in cyberspace (e.g., data structures), physical space (e.g., supply chains, material flow networks) and social space (e.g., social networks of things).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A video sequence can be represented as trajectory curves in a high-dimensional feature space, which can be decomposed into curve segments of low dimension for simplification [DeMenthon, et al., 1998].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans are able to make operations to summarize a movie according to their understandings and requirements, but are limited in ability to view and summarize huge volumes of videos generated everyday.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The patterns of events, conversations, and behaviors should be characterized to get semantically meaningful summaries of complicated video contents [Tewfik, 1999].</a>
