<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Summarizing a video requires machines to identify the essential characteristics of the video.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Summarizing data structures can provide more general data services.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Automatic video summarization can help humans quickly know the key content in big video volumes.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The problem of summarizing texts, pictures, and videos can be generalized as one problem.</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>To realize more meaningful video summarization, it is important to represent body language, spoken language, emotion, habit and psychological activities in microscopic.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(4) Generating a small network of texts according to a large set of pictures.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
