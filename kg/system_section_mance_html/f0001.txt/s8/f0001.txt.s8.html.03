<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The form of summary can be a semantic link network of texts, pictures, audios, and videos.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The problem of summarizing texts, pictures, and videos can be generalized as one problem.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A solution is to establish the semantic links between pictures, discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, select one picture to represent one community, and construct a network of the representative pictures.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Summarizing a large-scale graph of data is important to graph data management as it can render the patterns hidden in data [Navlakha, 2008] [Tian, 2008].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In macroscopic, it is important to represent the background of the video and relevant social structure, interests, fashion, rules, regulations, laws and culture of society in a summarization system.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Select the representative tags of these pictures, search relevant texts according to these tags (or select the texts that contain or link to these pictures), and then summarize these texts.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>So, summarization in these areas has the reasons of summarization and the correctness guarantee of using summaries.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Another way is to establish basic semantic links between pictures, find the best matched text, and make necessary text summarization.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Some approaches focus on some contents about who, what, where, and when in the framework of the video contents to produce a concept-level summary [Chen, 2009].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(1) Generating a piece of text to represent a set of pictures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The relations between texts, between pictures, and between videos can be mutually enforced, explained and rendered.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The key problem is to select a better picture from the candidates that have the same projections on the dimensions of time, location and topic, because the semantic links between pictures may be poor.</a>
