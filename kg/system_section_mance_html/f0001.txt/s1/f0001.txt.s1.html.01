<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It is a natural idea to select and organize important sentences from the original text to form a summary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Summarization is involved in representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) extractive summarization (extracting important sentences from the given text) [Edmundson, 1969] [Mihalcea, 2005] [Shen, et al., 2007], and (2) synthesized summarization (summarization is a reformulated, compressed, abstracted, or synthesized text) [McKeown, et al., 1999] [Knight, 2002].</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The main focus of research is on text itself.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Humans experience with representation (at multiple levels), understanding and summarization in lifetime.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The abstractive summarizers can use different (probably more general) words to represent the main meaning of text.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Important sentences can be extracted out according to the statistical analysis and experience on the input text while making abstraction needs knowledge on and beyond the text.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The common point is regarding text summarization as an automatic process of distilling the most important language representation units from a text to produce an abridged version for a particular task and user [Mani and Maybury, 1999] [Mani, 2001].</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>And, the knowledge for summarization is often beyond text.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Summarization process excludes humans.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Text understanding is modeled by proposition network.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The extractive summarizers select appropriate phrases or sentences from the text and then compose them.</a>
