<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It is a natural idea to select and organize important sentences from the original text to form a summary.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Methods based on natural language analysis were used in summarization [Barzilay, et al., 1997] [Silber and McCoy, 2002] [Erkan, 2004].</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The common point is regarding text summarization as an automatic process of distilling the most important language representation units from a text to produce an abridged version for a particular task and user [Mani and Maybury, 1999] [Mani, 2001].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Summarization is involved in representation and understanding.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Text summarization research has been extended to multi-medias and social events.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Humans experience with representation (at multiple levels), understanding and summarization in lifetime.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Research on automatic text summarization started half century ago [Luhn et al., 1958] [Baxendale, 1958].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Machine learning methods apply statistical techniques to extraction, including Bayes Methods [Kupiec et al.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Important sentences can be extracted out according to the statistical analysis and experience on the input text while making abstraction needs knowledge on and beyond the text.</a>
