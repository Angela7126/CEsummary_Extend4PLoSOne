<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) single text [Luhn et al., 1958], (2) multiple texts [McKeown, 1995] [Radev, et al., 1998, 2002] [Nanba et al., 1999] [Agarwal et al., 2011], and (3) hybrid, which inputs one text and retrieves multiple relevant texts and then summarizes them so that readers can know more relevant contents.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The faceted navigation approach is not traditional text summarization, but it is a special summarization because it can extract different facets in large text(s) to enable users to read only the interested facet [Xu and Zhuge, 2012].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) extractive summarization (extracting important sentences from the given text) [Edmundson, 1969] [Mihalcea, 2005] [Shen, et al., 2007], and (2) synthesized summarization (summarization is a reformulated, compressed, abstracted, or synthesized text) [McKeown, et al., 1999] [Knight, 2002].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Important sentences can be extracted out according to the statistical analysis and experience on the input text while making abstraction needs knowledge on and beyond the text.</a>
