<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>New generation search engines have integrated pictures, the summaries of texts and hyperlinks in their formatted search results, which provides richer content for users than the link list provided by old search engines.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The strategy is to make use of sensors and create semantic links between pictures and texts by detecting common projections at physical and social dimensions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Current smart cameras (e.g., smart phones) can record the time and physical location of taking photos, which are the projections of pictures on the time dimension and the location dimension.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different from image retrieval (e.g., search images according to keywords), the picture-based summarization approach has a ground of texts (a network of source texts or summaries) when searching the picture-text repository.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>One advantage of incorporating pictures into summary is that pictures provide a different bridge between language units (e.g., sentences), especially when connection sentence cannot be found in original text.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The radius can be defined as the maximum length of link chain from the center (determined by core nodes) to any node.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>In real application, a summarization system should enable readers to adjust the radius according to requirement.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
