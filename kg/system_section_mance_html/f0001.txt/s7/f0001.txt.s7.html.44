<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>An explanation is that the summary with pictures gives readers stronger impression and provides more dimensions for rendering meaning, and establishes more links to render meaning.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As new pictures are continually added to the online systems, a good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>There could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected according to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences according to the semantic locality principle [Zhuge, 2010].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The summary with pictures is more attractive than the text-only summary.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The summary incorporating pictures can enhance reader's short-term and long-term memory.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Web 2.0 provides the platform for people to upload and tag pictures on the Web.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A picture can convey meaning in about 1-10 seconds due to its familiarity and complexity to the viewer.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In contrast, readers need to scan the whole text to know the text-only summary.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The generated summary is not unique as the tag sets of different pictures may be overlapped.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Existing summaries can be put into the space and linked to the tag set.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The core words such as "CIKM2012", "hotel", "golf" and "garden" can be identified by comparing the source text and tags.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>According to the efficiency principle and regional principle, the radius of the network should be small.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In this way, the existing summaries can be reused when making new summarizations.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Then, the relations like "back of" relying on the core words can be identified.</a>
