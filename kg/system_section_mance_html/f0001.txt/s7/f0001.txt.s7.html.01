<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>e) Construct a semantic link network of pictures, tags and language representations in relevant texts as the summary.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, the techniques of text summary can be extended to the construction of semantic link network and image retrieval [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Language representations like tags indicate the usage of the pictures.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Figure 8 depicts the idea of constructing a semantic link network of pictures and tags as a summary.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Image retrieval techniques can help find candidate pictures [Gudivada and Raghavan, 1995].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Pictures take the priority in conveying meaning while reading the summary with pictures.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>b) Select and use pictures to replace the texts in summary.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>From the evolution construction and social construction point of views [Zhuge, 2012], tags might have been used in some texts by people.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Humans are specialized in recognizing pictures as they experience and reflect the physical space and form knowledge in mind.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>One advantage of incorporating pictures into summary is that pictures provide a different bridge between language units (e.g., sentences), especially when connection sentence cannot be found in original text.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) browse all the pictures -> read the text beside each picture, and (2) view a picture -> read beside text -> ...</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Existing approaches such as feature-based approaches and machine learning approaches can be used to classify pictures.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A picture reflects a view of the physical space while natural language indicates a semantic image in mind.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different from image retrieval (e.g., search images according to keywords), the picture-based summarization approach has a ground of texts (a network of source texts or summaries) when searching the picture-text repository.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The Web 2.0 provides the platform for people to upload and tag pictures on the Web.</a>
