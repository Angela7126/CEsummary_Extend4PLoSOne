<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>One advantage of incorporating pictures into summary is that pictures provide a different bridge between language units (e.g., sentences), especially when connection sentence cannot be found in original text.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There could be different ways to arrange pictures in displays but picture should be selected according to the core sentences and arranged near the core sentences according to the semantic locality principle [Zhuge, 2010].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is a natural idea to incorporate pictures into summary since pictures have been widely used to render meaning in many representations.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The strategy is to make use of sensors and create semantic links between pictures and texts by detecting common projections at physical and social dimensions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As new pictures are continually added to the online systems, a good summarization system should be able to keep up-to-date pictures in summarization.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A summary rendered by both pictures and natural language provides more indicators for readers to build semantic images.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Current smart cameras (e.g., smart phones) can record the time and physical location of taking photos, which are the projections of pictures on the time dimension and the location dimension.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Figure 8 depicts the idea of constructing a semantic link network of pictures and tags as a summary.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Pictures and texts may be viewed again but pictures still take priority during reviewing.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>An explanation is that the summary with pictures gives readers stronger impression and provides more dimensions for rendering meaning, and establishes more links to render meaning.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>For example, the picture with tags a and b (e.g., hotel and garden u'\uff0c' indicating "a picture of hotel with nice garden") can bridge the sentence containing a (e.g., garden, indicating "It is a beautiful garden"), and the sentence containing b (e.g., hotel, indicating "The hotel is near the sea").</a>
