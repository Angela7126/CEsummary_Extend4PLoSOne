<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A summary should match the reader's cognitive level.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, concepts at the reader's cognitive level should be selected.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Input should also be evaluated because some representations are unnecessary for summarization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A summarizer can understand the input representation better if it knows more about the author, including the relevant articles and social networks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This also implies that a summarizer should be able to interact with readers so that it can select the appropriate representations (e.g., sentences) and use the representations that the reader is familiar with.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>On one hand, a very simple and short representation such as a short paragraph of text and a picture is unnecessary for summarization as they can be quickly understood.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The closed systems designed by particular persons are unable to make satisfied summarization because only the persons sharing knowledge with the writer can make satisfied summarization.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Summarization is involved in individual and social construction processes, so it concerns multiple dimensions.</a>
