<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This axiom is the basis of representation (including using languages) and summarization (especially, for multi-document summarization).</a>

<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.</a>
