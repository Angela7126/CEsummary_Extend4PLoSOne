<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations:</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Dictionaries explain words in texts, so they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>From this point of view, any text has a set of basic citations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>U p, and a set of representations {p, ..., p}.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some implicit citations just reuse others' sentences or clauses without any mark word.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Some implicit citations have mark words such as "someone says" and according to "someone's opinion".</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>appeared in text implicitly cite the scenario used in 1599 in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, and "into thin air" cites the book written by Jon Krakauer published in 1997 and many other earlier works.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, the above statement is suitable for text.</a>

<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Humans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times, so we have the following axiom.</a>
