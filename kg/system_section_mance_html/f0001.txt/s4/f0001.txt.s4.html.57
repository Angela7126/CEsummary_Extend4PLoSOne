<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A representation can be composed by a set of representations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations:</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>From this point of view, any text has a set of basic citations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>U p, and a set of representations {p, ..., p}.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Dictionaries explain words in texts, so they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Axiom (Additive Axiom).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If representation A cites a set of representations B, then B constitutes an extension of A.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>So, the above statement is suitable for text.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Therefore, it is necessary to understand citation when studying summarization.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>{p, ..., p}, which represents a recursive structure of an abstraction p(p), an union p U ...</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Humans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times, so we have the following axiom.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Some implicit citations have mark words such as "someone says" and according to "someone's opinion".</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>appeared in text implicitly cite the scenario used in 1599 in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar, and "into thin air" cites the book written by Jon Krakauer published in 1997 and many other earlier works.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>In scientific papers, the core representations usually appear in the front and in the end (e.g., title, abstract and conclusion) so that readers can be impressed before and after reading the main body.</a>
