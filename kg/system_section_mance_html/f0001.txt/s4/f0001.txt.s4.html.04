<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The summarization S of a set of representations P is rendered by its intention Int(P) and extension Ext(B) as follows, where S(Int(P)) is the summarization of the intention of P, S(Int(P) U Ext(P)) is the summarization of the intention and extension of P, p -> p' means that p cites p', {Cite(pi -> p) i in [1, ..., m]} denotes the set of cite representations in pi that cites p, and Cite(pi -> p) describes p from the view of the author of pi.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from static text, the citation network dynamically renders the source, the formation and evolution of the area, the backbone, the impact of researchers and institutions, potential knowledge flows through citation links [Zhuge, 2006], and the networks of cooperation between researchers and between institutions with the evolution of the area.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Cite representation in scientific papers is rendered by the paragraph or the sentence that includes the cite mark commonly used in a community.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The intention of representation is indicated by core representations and by citation from other representations.</a>
