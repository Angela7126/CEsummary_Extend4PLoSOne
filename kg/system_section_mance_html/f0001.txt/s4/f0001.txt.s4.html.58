<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>These implicit citations can be located and transformed into explicit citation by searching these mark words and the references according to author names mentioned in text and then inserting uniform citation marks like scientific papers.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Dictionaries explain words in texts, so they can be regarded as the basic implicit citations to all texts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A representation can be composed by a set of representations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some implicit citations have mark words such as "someone says" and according to "someone's opinion".</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>From this point of view, any text has a set of basic citations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, a representation p can be formalized as a structure of representations:</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Citation is a basic semantic link of constructing a complex text.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Some implicit citations just reuse others' sentences or clauses without any mark word.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If representation A cites a set of representations B, then B constitutes an extension of A.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, the above statement is suitable for text.</a>

<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In scientific papers, the core representations usually appear in the front and in the end (e.g., title, abstract and conclusion) so that readers can be impressed before and after reading the main body.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Humans have been composing complex representations and making summarization through times, so we have the following axiom.</a>
