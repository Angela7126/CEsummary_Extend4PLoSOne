<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A semantic link network of important concepts and relations can help readers quickly know the main cues and measures in representations.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(3) Semantic link network.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The semantic link network can be regarded as the map of the cyberspace and social space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic link network can be regarded as the extension of the semantic net (Quillian, 1966) and correlational nets (Ceccato, 1961), which represents the relations between concepts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A semantic link network is a way to organize multimedia.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Figure 5 shows a three-dimensional space for organizing representations through time dimension, author dimension and topic dimension.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This priority arranges relevant representations distributed in the original representation at the places close to the core representations in the summary.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Relevant representations are arranged at the places closed to the core representation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The core representations in one representation (e.g., text) render its topic.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The function 'Classifying & Linking' classifies representations according to the given dimensions, connects representations by discovering implicit relations, transforming implicit relations into explicit relations, discovering communities, and identifying appropriate representations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The key is how to extract appropriate nodes and links from representations.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) Transform representations (including, citation structure) into a multi-dimensional classification space (denoted as A in Figure 7) by classifying and linking representations.</a>
