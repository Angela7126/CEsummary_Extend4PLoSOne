<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Figure 5 shows a three-dimensional space for organizing representations through time dimension, author dimension and topic dimension.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Organizing representations in time order or reverse time order.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Time order is in line with human innate sense of time and the process of reading.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The linear order of traditional text representations is in line with human physiological characteristics and innate sense of time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) Topic relevancy threads within a period at the time dimension.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The core representations in one representation (e.g., text) render its topic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This priority arranges relevant representations distributed in the original representation at the places close to the core representations in the summary.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(2) Time threads within a topic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>topic, region, time and author, each of which is defined by a tree structure.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Relevant representations are arranged at the places closed to the core representation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A dimension like topic can organize coordinates as a tree representing multi-level generalization and specialization.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It enables readers to know the topic movement of a particular author or a group of authors through time.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(1) Generalization and specialization threads through a topic tree.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The original structure of the core representations takes the priority to appear in summary.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) Time.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Features such as location, front size and color render a core representation.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>It also enables readers to know the role of author such as the source and the novice during the development of a topic at certain time.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(1) Transform representations (including, citation structure) into a multi-dimensional classification space (denoted as A in Figure 7) by classifying and linking representations.</a>
