<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>This priority arranges relevant representations distributed in the original representation at the places close to the core representations in the summary.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The function 'Classifying & Linking' classifies representations according to the given dimensions, connects representations by discovering implicit relations, transforming implicit relations into explicit relations, discovering communities, and identifying appropriate representations.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The linear order of traditional text representations is in line with human physiological characteristics and innate sense of time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For a set of closely relevant representations, the order of organizing representations in a summary should consider the formation process of the set, which reflects certain semantics of the set.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Figure 5 shows a three-dimensional space for organizing representations through time dimension, author dimension and topic dimension.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Inventing a new interface that can easily convey representations through multiple channels is a way to improve human understanding.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This function is to emerge pictures or video clips relevant to the important representations in viewing scope while displaying.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An appropriate form concerns the innovative cyber display based on human mental structure, psychological structure and innovative display.</a>
