<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Simple structures such as list, tree and grid have been widely used to summarize representations in daily life, e.g., displaying table of contents, family trees, organization structures, and properties on map.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The function 'Classifying & Linking' classifies representations according to the given dimensions, connects representations by discovering implicit relations, transforming implicit relations into explicit relations, discovering communities, and identifying appropriate representations.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The linear order of traditional text representations is in line with human physiological characteristics and innate sense of time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Semantic link network can be regarded as the extension of the semantic net (Quillian, 1966) and correlational nets (Ceccato, 1961), which represents the relations between concepts.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A semantic link network of important concepts and relations can help readers quickly know the main cues and measures in representations.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Previous research on text summarization neglects the innovation of displaying summary as researchers assume that the form of output is the same as the input.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Summarization carries out in an interaction environment where people read, write, cite and communicate with personal spaces.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This form of representation looks similar to the wind-rose plot, which can efficiently convey the meaning of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a location.</a>
