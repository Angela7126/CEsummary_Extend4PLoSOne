<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>and, (3) the form of summary is diverse and summarization carries out through multiple dimensions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Further, some basic behaviors of summarization are studied in the complex space consisting of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.</a>
