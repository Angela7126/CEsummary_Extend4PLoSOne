<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Knowledge representation approaches such as the production rule [Davis, et al, 1977], the frame [Minsky, 1975] and the semantic net [Quillian, 1966] are symbol systems that can carry out reasoning for solving problems.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) uniformly represented business processes and behaviors, software architectures, processes and behaviors, and data structures.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Cyberspace consists of huge links among texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, corresponding to human senses and the structures of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Discovering unity in diversity is a scientific research method, which has generated many important scientific principles and theories, for example, Maxwell successfully unified electricity and magnetism.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Physical instruments such as functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI and electroencephalography EGG have been used to detect the physical status of mind [Turkeltaub, 2002].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A complex semantic link network of different forms enables one form (e.g., movies) to link to other forms (e.g., novel, script, pictures of actors and actress, posters, comments, related movie, etc).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Cognitive psychologists have been exploring mental concepts through rational definition, prototype, exemplar and knowledge studies.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cognitive psychologists argue that people usually remember meaning rather than exact representation and that meaning represents through the perceptual and motor systems for interacting with the world.</a>
