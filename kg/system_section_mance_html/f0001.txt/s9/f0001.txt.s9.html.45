<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(2) If the cognitive level of the original representation is higher than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A summary is suitable if its cognitive level is the same as the reader's cognitive level.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It stands for the basic cognitive level of all the authors in the field.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The cognitive level for a particular research field can be reflected by all of its papers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The reason is that a reader can easily and quickly understand the summary if the dimension of the target space is the same as the dimension of the reader's personal space, which represents the reader's mind (cognitive architecture).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This enables summarization systems to use more general or specific concepts in summary.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The scale of summary can be regarded as a dimension.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This indicates that human mind uniformly processes various things at certain cognitive level.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts, pictures, videos and graphs.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>A distinguished characteristic is that humans generate behaviors (including mental behaviors) different from the input.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Summarization is a special transformation that operates dimension reduction for easier understanding.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>However, unifying different theories is hard because it needs to uncover the common nature behind existing theories, and different theories may represent different aspects of a domain and use different representation systems that are difficult to be unified.</a>
