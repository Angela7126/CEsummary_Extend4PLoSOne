<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A cognitive level determines a representation lattice.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Cyberspace consists of huge links among texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, corresponding to human senses and the structures of cyberspace, physical space and social space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A complex semantic link network of different forms enables one form (e.g., movies) to link to other forms (e.g., novel, script, pictures of actors and actress, posters, comments, related movie, etc).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>(3) If the cognitive level of the original representation is lower than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more general concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
