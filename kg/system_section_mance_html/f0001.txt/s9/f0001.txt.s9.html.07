<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A cognitive level determines a representation lattice.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A unified method for summarizing different forms can be developed by transforming texts, videos, pictures and graphs into semantic link networks.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(3) If the cognitive level of the original representation is lower than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more general concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>(2) If the cognitive level of the original representation is higher than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A complex semantic link network of different forms enables one form (e.g., movies) to link to other forms (e.g., novel, script, pictures of actors and actress, posters, comments, related movie, etc).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The basic cognitive level can be established for the hierarchy of universal concepts.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
