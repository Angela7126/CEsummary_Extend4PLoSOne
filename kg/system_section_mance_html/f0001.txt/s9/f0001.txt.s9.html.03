<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Ontology helps establish a general representation from the nature of the world, knowledge and knowing.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Externalization of the internal representation involves in complex mental, physical and social behaviors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different representations of the same thing can be linked to the same semantic image for understanding and thinking [Zhuge, 2010, 2011, 2012].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The scale of summary can be regarded as a dimension.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is important to ensure the understandability and expressiveness of the integrated representation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This indicates the possibility of creating a unified method for processing different objects such as texts, pictures, videos and graphs.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A text can be transformed into a semantic link network of words, sentences and paragraphs.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The cognitive hierarchy of different communities corresponds to different sub-graphs of the hierarchy and has different basic cognitive levels.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The size of summary depends on user requirement and cognitive level.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>In addition, voice and music can render the link between videos.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The reason is that a reader can easily and quickly understand the summary if the dimension of the target space is the same as the dimension of the reader's personal space, which represents the reader's mind (cognitive architecture).</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The union of representations integrates different representations to provide a global view of these representations.</a>
