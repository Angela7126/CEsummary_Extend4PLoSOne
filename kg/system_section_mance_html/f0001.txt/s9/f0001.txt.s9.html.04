<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Multi-dimensional summarization is a function S(P(d1, ..., dm)) = T(di, ..., dj), which transforms a representation p(d1=p1 ..., dm=pm) in the source space of representations P with dimensions d1, ..., and dm into a representation t(di=ti, ..., dj=pj) in the target space of representations T with dimensions di, ..., and dj (m u'\u2265' j u'\u2265' i u'\u2265' 1) such that t contains the core of p at dimensions di, ..., and dj.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One form of representation like text usually links to other forms of representation like pictures, and possibly to video, audio and graph, which can be regarded as citation for explanation, complementation or extension.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>A complex semantic link network of different forms enables one form (e.g., movies) to link to other forms (e.g., novel, script, pictures of actors and actress, posters, comments, related movie, etc).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
