<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The union of the semantic link network and the classification space forms a complex classification space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The basic cognitive level can be established for the hierarchy of universal concepts.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The general summarization inputs a representation and a cognitive level at certain ontology and then outputs a representation lattice and a recommended representation.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A cognitive level determines a representation lattice.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(3) If the cognitive level of the original representation is lower than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more general concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A complex space incorporating multi-dimensional classification space and semantic link network was used to represent and organize semantic images.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) If the cognitive level of the original representation is the same as the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use the core representations in the original representation.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>(2) If the cognitive level of the original representation is higher than the reader's cognitive level, the summary should use more specific concepts in the commonsense category hierarchy.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Representations can be generalized, united, classified and semantically linked to form a lattice of representations at a cognitive level of ontology as shown in Figure 9.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>One semantic link network of texts can link to the other semantic link networks of texts to form a larger semantic link network through such relations as citation and coauthor.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Ontology helps explain representation and establish the links between representations.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The cognitive hierarchy of different communities corresponds to different sub-graphs of the hierarchy and has different basic cognitive levels.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The form of summary can be a small semantic link network of texts, videos, audios, pictures and graphs, which provides more semantic indicators than single type of form like silent movie.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The union of representations integrates different representations to provide a global view of these representations.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Externalization of the internal representation involves in complex mental, physical and social behaviors.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Ontology helps establish a general representation from the nature of the world, knowledge and knowing.</a>
