<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This is because the establishment of rich social relations indicates common individual characteristics and social characteristics.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The person who shares the represented knowledge and the knowledge for representation is suitable for summarization.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>However, authors have limited time and may be influenced by individual characteristics (e.g., health and mood, and worldview) and social characteristics (e.g., culture, economy and influence).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary, and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary.</a>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The suitable summarizer for summarizing a representation is rendered by the social network of its writers and readers.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Ranking reviews to encourage contribution and competition among reviews reflect social value in a summarization environment.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The problem of designing a suitable summarizer can be transformed into the problem of searching a suitable summarizer in cyberspace.</a>

<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(4) Enabling different summaries to cooperate and compete with each other for impact at multiple dimensions (e.g., acceptance for reading and adoption for generating new summaries).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This is because the represented knowledge was shared and the knowledge for representation is at the same level.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The suitable person should have similar experience with the author (including education, work, etc.) through which knowledge is learned and shared.</a>
