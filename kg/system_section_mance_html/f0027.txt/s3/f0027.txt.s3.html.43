<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In this way, a reviewer with access to public data could reproduce the data sets and analysis procedures.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>And so large data archives are becoming increasingly 'isolated' in the network sense -- one can copy gigabytes across the Internet today, but not petabytes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For example, a data-mining paper needs to include the explicit description (data-base query) of how the data that were analysed in the paper were collected and filtered, but not the data themselves.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Are we reaching the limits of what one scientist, or one lab, can expect to achieve in data handling and analysis?</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This required new standards for data exchange, and a semantic dictionary that offers a controlled vocabulary of astronomy terms.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For the analysis to be repeatable in 20 years' time requires archiving both data and tools.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If so, this will have implications for how we review and publish our work.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>To encourage data sharing, it should be rewarded.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So we can expect tentimes more data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Astronomers created the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (www.IVOA.net), integrating most of the world's medium and large astronomy archives.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Likely computer-performance improvements by 2011 include tenfold more processing, storage and network bandwidth per dollar.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The speed of the Internet has not kept pace with the growth of scientific datasets.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>But the management of distributed computations raises new questions of security, free access to public data and cost.</a>
