<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>that is, ascientist may collect new data, combine themwith data from other archives, and ultimately deposit the summary data back into a common archive.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This required new standards for data exchange, and a semantic dictionary that offers a controlled vocabulary of astronomy terms.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Astronomers created the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (www.IVOA.net), integrating most of the world's medium and large astronomy archives.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And so large data archives are becoming increasingly 'isolated' in the network sense -- one can copy gigabytes across the Internet today, but not petabytes.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The publication process itself is increasingly electronic, with new ways to disseminate scientific information (such as the preprint repository arXiv.org).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Multidisciplinary databases also provide a rich environment for performing science;</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In the future, working with large data sets will typically mean sending computations to the data, rather than copying the data to your workstation.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Insteadthey 'mine' available databases, looking fornew patterns and discoveries, without everpicking up a pipette.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Public data creators and publishers should be given credit, and archives must be able to automatically provide provenance details.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In this way, a reviewer with access to public data could reproduce the data sets and analysis procedures.</a>
