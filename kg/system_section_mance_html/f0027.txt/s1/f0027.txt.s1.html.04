<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If we can no longer examine all the data on a single piece of paper, how can we 'see' a new pattern or find a data point that does not fit a hypothesis?</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But there are few tools to properly visualize data across multiple scales and data sets.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Scientists must labour to organize, sort and reduce the data, with each analysis step producing smaller data sets that eventually lead to the big picture.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This worked fine when small amounts of data were entered into notebooks and the analysis was computed alongside them.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But data volumes are doubling every year in most areas of modern science and the analysis is becoming more and more complex, exceeding the capacity of the paper notebook.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Many experiments today load their data into databases before attempting to analyse them.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>With data correlated over many dimensions and millions of points, none of the old steps -- do experiment, record results, analyse and publish -- is straightforward.</a>
