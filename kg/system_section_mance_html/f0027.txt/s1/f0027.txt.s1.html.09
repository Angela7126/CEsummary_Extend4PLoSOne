<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Scientists must labour to organize, sort and reduce the data, with each analysis step producing smaller data sets that eventually lead to the big picture.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>But there are few tools to properly visualize data across multiple scales and data sets.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Matlab, Mathematica and Excel are popular analysis tools.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>These computers also perform data analysis;</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Many experiments today load their data into databases before attempting to analyse them.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As data volumes grow, it is increasingly arduous to extract knowledge.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Fortunately there are database tools, such as data cubes, that we believe can fulfil this role (see 'Data cubes' overleaf).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Today, most scientists have replaced or enhanced their notebooks with desktop computers that record their results, provide a portal to the scientific literature, and link them to collaborators via email.</a>
