<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Databases provide tools to organize large data sets, find objects that match certaincriteria, compute statistics about the data, and analyse them to find patterns.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Scientists must labour to organize, sort and reduce the data, with each analysis step producing smaller data sets that eventually lead to the big picture.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Matlab, Mathematica and Excel are popular analysis tools.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These computers also perform data analysis;</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But there are few tools to properly visualize data across multiple scales and data sets.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As data volumes grow, it is increasingly arduous to extract knowledge.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Fortunately there are database tools, such as data cubes, that we believe can fulfil this role (see 'Data cubes' overleaf).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Many experiments today load their data into databases before attempting to analyse them.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Analysing terabytes of data (one terabyte is 1,000 gigabytes) is a challenge;</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>but petabyte data sets (of more than 1,000terabytes) are on the horizon.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>But none of these programs scale up to handle millions of data records -- and they are primitive by most standards.</a>
