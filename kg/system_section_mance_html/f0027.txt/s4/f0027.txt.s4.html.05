<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, not all experiments will experience exponential growth.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A similar phenomenon occurred with DNA chips and gene sequencers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>And once these peta-scale experiments are switched on they will produce roughly the same amount of data each year -- merely linear growth.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>But in the scaling-out model, experiments that deploy an array of small instruments can exploit the coming explosion in cheaper commodity technology.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Such facilities are not easily leapfrogged.</a>
