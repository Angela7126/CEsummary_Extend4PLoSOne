<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This system integrates local environmental data from a sensor network with regional data on hydrology, climate, biodiversity and biogeochemistry.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Standards for sharing data are crucial, for example, in understanding soil ecosystems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>It is difficult to capture all the model numbers, software revisions, parameter settings and process steps in an enduring format.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Procedures already involve instruments and software with myriad parameters.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>We are helping to build a system for measuring long-term environmental trends that affect soil biodiversity (www.lifeunderyourfeet.org;</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Increasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>both Matlab and GenBankwill change enormously in that time.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>There are collaborations sharing data across departments and time zones, and important discoveries are made by scientists and teams who combine different skill sets -- not just biologists, physicists and chemists, but also computer scientists, statisticians and data-visualization experts.</a>
