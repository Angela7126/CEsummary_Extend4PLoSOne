<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>There are collaborations sharing data across departments and time zones, and important discoveries are made by scientists and teams who combine different skill sets -- not just biologists, physicists and chemists, but also computer scientists, statisticians and data-visualization experts.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This system integrates local environmental data from a sensor network with regional data on hydrology, climate, biodiversity and biogeochemistry.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Increasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>We do not have a solution for this problem, but it is important to recognize it as such, and to do what is possible to capture the workflows and to develop protocols for documenting instruments, procedures and measurements in ways that will be usable in several decades' time.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>For these data to be useful to others, they must be published using a controlled vocabulary and instandard forms, and the instruments and measurements must be well specified.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>As experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex, data become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.</a>
