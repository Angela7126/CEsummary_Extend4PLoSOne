<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Increasingly, scientists are analysing complex systems that require data to be combined from several groups and even several disciplines.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>they need to know some data management, computational concepts and statistical techniques.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There are collaborations sharing data across departments and time zones, and important discoveries are made by scientists and teams who combine different skill sets -- not just biologists, physicists and chemists, but also computer scientists, statisticians and data-visualization experts.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is important to realize that today's graduate students need formal training in areas beyond their central discipline:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>in formatting, so that data written by one group can be easily read and understood by others;</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Too much effort is wasted on converting from one proprietary data format to another.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A collaboration involving hundreds of Internet-connected scientists raises questions about standards for data sharing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>For these data to be useful to others, they must be published using a controlled vocabulary and instandard forms, and the instruments and measurements must be well specified.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>and in workflows, so that analysis steps can be executed across the Internet and reproduced by others at a later date.</a>
