<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Procedures already involve instruments and software with myriad parameters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex, data become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>both Matlab and GenBankwill change enormously in that time.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Experiments are themselves becoming electronic as computers become essential parts of scientific instruments;</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This system integrates local environmental data from a sensor network with regional data on hydrology, climate, biodiversity and biogeochemistry.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The output is cross-correlated with a sequence archive (GenBank) and the results are analysed with Matlab.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Fully documenting these steps would be arduous, and there is little chance that someone could repeat the exact procedure 20 years from now;</a>
