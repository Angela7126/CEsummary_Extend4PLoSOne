<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Fully documenting the sensors and data-collection process is arduous, and there are few standards for us to draw on.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>they are used not only to manage and analyse vast data sets, but also to acquire them in the first place.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>and in workflows, so that analysis steps can be executed across the Internet and reproduced by others at a later date.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For these data to be useful to others, they must be published using a controlled vocabulary and instandard forms, and the instruments and measurements must be well specified.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As experiments yield more data, and analysis becomes more complex, data become increasingly difficult to document and reproduce.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Standards for sharing data are crucial, for example, in understanding soil ecosystems.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>We do not have a solution for this problem, but it is important to recognize it as such, and to do what is possible to capture the workflows and to develop protocols for documenting instruments, procedures and measurements in ways that will be usable in several decades' time.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>It is difficult to capture all the model numbers, software revisions, parameter settings and process steps in an enduring format.</a>
