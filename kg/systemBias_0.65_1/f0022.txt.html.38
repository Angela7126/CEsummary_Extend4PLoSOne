<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Odd + odd is even so the total is even, but the total is 31.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Taking into account the jog one gets an answer as to the parity of the number of vertical dominoes.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>However, this argument is at a meta-level to the Minsky and Stefanuk proofs and therefore can't claim to be non-creative.</a>
