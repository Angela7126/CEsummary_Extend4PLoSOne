<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>On the other hand, the legal concept of a person's taxable income is refined by defining more.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Thus in the context of a particular grocery, an object is a lemon if and only if it is a small yellow fruit.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A sentence involving an approximate concept may have a definite truth value even if the concept is illdefined.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Thus the theory of sequential circuits is an approximate theory, and it is not an approximation to a definite less approximate theory of purely digital circuits.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Suppose an approximate concept represented by a predicate p(x) has a sufficient condition suff(x) and a necessary condition nec(x).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Suppose a robot uses T1 as a theory of the blocks world and takes actions accordingly, but the real world corresponds to T2.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some approximate concepts can be refined by learning more and some by defining more and some by both, but it isn't possible in general to make them well-defined.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This makes the concept of D flipflop itself approximate, perhaps not in the same sense as some other approximate theories.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The article treats successively approximate objects, approximate theories, and formalisms for describing how one object or theory approximates another.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If this is too platonic for your taste, you can regard approximating the world as a different notion than that of one theory approximating another.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>In the simpler theory T1, there is a list of names of mountains paired with lists of climbing expeditions or names of climbers.</a>
