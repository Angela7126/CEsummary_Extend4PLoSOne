<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Moreover, just as in the map coloring problem, postponing some variables may remove enough goals involving other variables so that they in turn become postponable.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the programmer can arbitrarily rewrite the program, he may change the logic as well as the control.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Alain Colmerauer (1981) wrote such a program for rewriting the Pereira-Porto coloring program.</a>
