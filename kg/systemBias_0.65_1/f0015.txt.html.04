<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>I suppose some philosophers, psychologists, and English teachers would maintain that the blanket manufacturer is guilty of anthropomorphism and some will claim that great harm can come from thus ascribing to machines qualities which only humans can have.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>My answer is based on work in the field of artificial intelligence (usually abbreviated AI) which is the science and engineering of making computers solve problems and behave in ways generally considered to be intelligent.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Some programs acquire information from people or other programs and plan actions for people that involve what other people do.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Long before we can make machines with human capability, we will have many machines that cannot be understood except in mental terms.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Tries -- This is important in understanding machines that have a variety of ways of achieving a goal including possibly ways that we don't know about.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Current AI approaches to ascribing specific mental qualities use the symbolism of mathematical logic.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>He has ascribed the mental quality of wanting to the dog without claiming that the dog thinks like a human and can form out of its parts the thought, 'I want to go out'.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Much that we'll need to know concerns the information stored in computers, which is why we find ourselves using psychological words like 'knows', 'thinks', and 'wants' in referring to machines, even though machines are very different from humans and these words arose from the human need to talk about other humans.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>AI research usually involves programming a computer to use specific concepts and to have specific mental qualities.</a>
