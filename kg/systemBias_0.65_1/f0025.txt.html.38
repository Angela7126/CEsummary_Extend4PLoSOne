<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>8) Because of the possibility of transcendence, the use of contexts as objects is not just a matter of efficiency.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, the resulting flat theory can no longer be transcended within the formalism, because it is not an object that can be referred to as a whole.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Thus a robot designed in this way is not stuck with the concepts it has been given.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In such a theory, formulas express relations among contexts would be primary rather than the propositions true in the contexts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>[McC93] discusses lifting a simple theory of above(x,y) as the transitive closure of on(x,y) to an outer situation calculus context that uses on(x,y,s) and above(x,y,s).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>7) We can deal with this phenomenon in our formalism by ensuring that it is always possible to transcend the outermost context used so far.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, two contexts with the same theory need not be the same, because they may have different relations with other contexts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>1) Conventional linguistic applications like the referents of pronouns can be treated using contexts as objects, but formalized contexts are also useful for more complex anaphora.</a>
