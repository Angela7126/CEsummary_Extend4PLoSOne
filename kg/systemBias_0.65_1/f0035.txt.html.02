<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Tom Barclay, Tamas Budavari, Tanu Malik, Peter Kunszt, Don Slutz, Jan Vandenberg, Chris Stoughton, and Ani Thakar, helped build the SkyServer and SkyQuery.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Automatically answering this query requires a uniform naming, coordinate system, measurement units, and error handling.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The SkyServer database was designed to answer 20 queries that typify the kinds of questions an astronomer might ask of an archive [Szalay.] A typical query is "Find gravitational lens candidates.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Astronomers typically get archival data by requesting large parts of the archive on magnetic tape, or smaller parts by File Transfer Protocol (FTP) over the Internet.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>GUI client interface that lets users pose SQL queries, while Python and EMACS interfaces allow client scripts to access the database.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Using web services technologies, it federates the optical SDSS archive at Fermi Lab with a radio survey [FIRST] archive at Johns Hopkins, and a Two Meter All Sky Survey (2MASS) archive at Cal Tech.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Using this information, astronomers can extract hundreds of object attributes including the magnitude, extent, probable structure and morphology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The scientist then analyzes the data with a combination of a scripting language (tcl and Python are popular) and a personal analysis toolkit acquired during their careers.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Astronomy was early to adopt computational techniques to model stellar and galactic formation and celestial mechanics.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This and similar experiences convince us that interactive access to scientific data and datamining tools can have a huge impact on scientists' productivity.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Database query systems have automatic indexing and parallel search that let people explore huge databases.</a>
