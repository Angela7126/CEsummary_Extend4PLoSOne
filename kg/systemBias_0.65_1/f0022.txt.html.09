<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The number of dominoes projecting from the top row to the second row is odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Likewise the the number of horizontal dominoes is odd.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Starting with the top row, compute the parity of the number of dominoes projecting down out of each row.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Stefanuk proofs are just as uncreative a Minsky proofs.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A student said something like, "An odd number of dominoes project down from the top row and an odd number down from the second row to the third ...</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Counting colors shows that Stefanuk proofs and Minsky proofs always work on any even board.</a>
