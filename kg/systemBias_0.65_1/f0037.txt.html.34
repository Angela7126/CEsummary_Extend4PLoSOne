<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, shared disk systems have morphed to partitioned served-disk systems to improve locality.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Things are going so well that the company decides to (1) do a leveraged buyout of a much larger company and asks you to integrate your site with theirs, (2) form a consortium with two other companies to provide some new services, (3) internationalize the operation offering services in the 20 major languages and 50 major currencies and 500 tax codes, and (4) embrace the latest technology fad, which today is UDDI, WSDL, schemas, XLANG, SOAP, and XML.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The next step is to have redundant servers and a load balancing system that can redistribute the load as servers fail.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Sites must be geo-plexed to achieve more than four 9s of availability -- that is the data is stored in two different geographic locations, and clients are routed to be fallback site if the primary site is down.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>But, they have to have exactly the same data (or nearly so).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The chairman of IBM is calling for the return of the mainframe, asserting it is cheaper to run 1,000 Linux systems on a mainframe than it is to run 1,000 Intel boxes -- mostly because the management costs dominate.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So, paradoxically, shared-memory and shared-disk systems are becoming shared-nothing systems as they aim for better data locality.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>So the first requirement for any system is that it has useful applications.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In part this is due to Moore's law, in part it is due to our finally bringing the software base to a modular and partitionable architecture that maps well to shared-nothing arrays (and hence to shared memory and shared disk arrays).</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Taking Microsoft as an example, the most spectacular MSN outages of late have been due to operations mistakes (misconfigured a router) and sabotage (denial of service attacks).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>So, paradoxically, shared memory systems have been successful by adopting a shared-nothing software architecture.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Clearly, these problems have magnified in the recent past and it seems likely that they will increase.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>If high-volume Intel platforms price performance is normalized to 1, then the minis cost 10$ per unit and the mainframes cost 100$ per unit.</a>
