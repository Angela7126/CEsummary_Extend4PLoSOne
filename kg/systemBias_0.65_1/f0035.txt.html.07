<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Automatically combining data from multiple data sources, each with its own data lineage, data units, data quality, and data conventions is a huge challenge.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(2) Data mining algorithms and tools that can recognize and categorize data anomalies and trends.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Astronomers used data analysis tools to explore and visualize the data catalogs.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>(1) Good database plumbing to store, organize, query, and access the data -- both in huge single-site archives, and in the distributed Internet database involving all the archives.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First, it will require the active participation of the many Astronomy groups that gather data and produce catalogs.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>(3) Finally, good data visualization tools are needed that make it easy to pose questions in a visual way and to "see" the answers.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The WWT must also make it easy for their colleagues to find and analyze this data using standard tools.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The World-Wide Telescope (WWT) will emerge from the world's online astronomy data.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>These algorithms will draw heavily on techniques from statistics and machine learning, but will also require new approaches that scale linearly with data size.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In contrast, most statistical analysis and data mining algorithms are nonlinear.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The WWT must make it easy for Astronomers to publish their data on the Internet in understandable forms.</a>
