<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The data pipeline processing that analyses the raw detector data and the data storage is linearly proportional to the amount of data.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In the Virtual Observatory, most the data will be remote.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>a standardized way to invoke remote resources on the Web and to exchange complex data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Web Services:</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The exponential growth in both the number of data sources and individual data set sizes puts a particular burden on the projects that generate the data:</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Much of the work was invested in building the processing pipeline, special data access methods, and Web services.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, the archives have only 12% of the total data and less than 25% of the public data (data is typically made public after a year).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The Virtual Observatory -- sometimes also called the World Wide Telescope -- is under construction in many countries [1, 2, 5, 7, 10] It seeks to provide portals, protocols, and standards that unify the world's astronomy archives into a giant database containing all astronomy literature, images, raw data, derived datasets, and simulation data -- integrated as a single intelligent telescope [25].</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This pipeline processing is a natural candidate for Grid services and particularly the virtual data toolkit.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Web services define a distributed object model that lets us build Internet-scale software components and services.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The vast majority of the data and almost all the "current" data will be decentralized among the data sources -- the new publishers.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>They have the additional roles of data publisher and data curator.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>They provide data mining tools that allow easy search and subsetting of the data objects at each archive.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As the amount of data is doubling every year, in three years the data grows by eightfold.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The transformation of raw instrument data into calibrated and cataloged data is a demanding computational task.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) specifies how to invoke applications that can talk to one another and exchange complex data.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The remote data volume may be huge;</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Thus, astronomy data on the Grid will generally reside in read-intensive databases that will be accessed by associative query interfaces that subset the data.</a>
