<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>It is easy to verify that all closures of the single semantic link types construct a classification for the semantic link types of the SLN schema, and we can decompose an SLN schema based on such a classification.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to Theorem 1, the decomposition is a loss-less one.</a>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>According to Theorem 1, the decomposition from Algorithm 3 is loss-less.</a>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The essence of semantic rule-constraint normal form is to classify the semantic link type set into different parts according to the rule set.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Updating an SLN schema concerns resource types, semantic link types, and reasoning rules.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Users can define SLN instances by instantiating the global schema, or define a sub-schema according to the global schema first and then instantiating the sub-schemas.</a>
