<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, paradoxically, shared memory systems have been successful by adopting a shared-nothing software architecture.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So, paradoxically, shared-memory and shared-disk systems are becoming shared-nothing systems as they aim for better data locality.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>These ScaleOut systems are impressive.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Now most modern database systems offer database replication -- and the feature is widely used to geoplex data and to provide fallback service.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>that appear to be sharing disks are actually very impressive served disk systems with impressive cache management.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Today, several vendors are shipping systems that scale to 32 or 64 processors, with either a uniform memory access (UMA) or non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>There is a class of single-node ScaleUp systems from HP, IBM, and Sun, running DB2, Oracle, and Sybase that process about 300 million tpcC transactions per day on a computer costing about ten million dollars with a 20 TB database.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Still, they show a 3-tier architecture (1) fat client, (2) TP-monitor or web server, (3) backend database system.</a>

<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>And then there is a class of multi-node ScaleOut clusters from IBM and Compaq running Windows2000 and SQL Server producing about a billion tpcC transactions per day on a 42 TB database.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>More recently most database systems have become increasingly introspective.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The client database has a cache of all the data needed to take the client orders and is completely decoupled from the backend server that deals with other less-reliable services.</a>
