<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we can put a Graphical query interface on the front of this, and a good data visualization system on the output, we should be able to allow astronomers to do data analysis without having to write programs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>In order for the archives to cooperate and in order for astronomers to compare data from multiple archives, the data in each archive needs to have a clear description of what it means.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore is increasingly important that large computations lay the data out on disk in a sequential order, and scan it sequentially if possible.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A single disk can deliver about 30 MBps of data if the disk is read sequentially.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the data is not there, the processor has to go to the level 2 cache (a few megabytes) that are typically 10 clocks away.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>In that time, a modern processor can execute 4 instructions in parallel, if all the data is available (a quad issue processor).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Among other things it means that if you can afford to store the data for one time period (a year) then storing it forever only doubles the hardware cost.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>That is surprisingly rare (for a variety of reasons data in physics, in geology, in medicine, in finance, and in the Internet is encumbered by privacy and by commercial interests).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Although computers are getting faster, the speed of light is not changing (so if you want to get data from the other coast, you must wait 60 milliseconds (request-response round-trip time)).</a>
