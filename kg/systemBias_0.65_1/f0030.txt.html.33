<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As the amount of data is doubling every year, in three years the data grows by eightfold.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>New instruments emerge ever more frequently, so the growth of data is a little faster than the Moore's law prediction.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In the Virtual Observatory, most the data will be remote.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As more and more data access is through automated facilities, it is increasingly important to capture the details of how the data was derived and calibrated.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Thus, the archives have only 12% of the total data and less than 25% of the public data (data is typically made public after a year).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This means that during the data-production phase of a six-year project, the data grows at a linear rate.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Thus, the community's total processing, networking, and storage costs are likely to remain stable over time, despite exponential growth in data volumes.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>One needs to track the heritage of each object, what version of the processing software has created it, and at what date.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Once DAGs are widely implemented, they will be the proper way to preserve the data provenance.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Hence, the mean time the data spends in the project archive before moving to the centralized facility is about three years.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Thus, the threshold to join the VO will be low.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Turning this around, the national facilities will have all the data that is more than three years old.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If the query is small, it can just be sent to one of the archive servers.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>the rates may be different for other areas of science, but the main conclusions remain the same.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As a result, data access to remote resources needs to be just as transparent as if it were local.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Either we need to look much deeper and detect fainter objects, or we have to go to extreme colors, by selecting the edges of a color distribution.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If the Virtual Observatory builds the right 20% and satisfies 80% of the astrophysics community's needs, it will be counted a success.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>It then decides which archives have relevant data (by querying each of them) and calculates an optimal query plan to answer the question, doing a Bayesian spatial cross-correlation among the objects in each archive.</a>
