<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e10, and e11 are semantic links in the minimum semantic cover, other links are reasoned out by other links in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A closure of a CPSocio-SLN S is a semantic link network S+ such that all semantic links in S are also in S+, and any semantic link that can be derived from reasoning on S+ is also in S+.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>For a complex CPSocio-SLN, when the minimum spanning graph set of every semantic link has been obtained, if we add a new semantic link e = (n1, n2, u'\u0391' ), we use the following algorithm to update all of the minimum spanning graph sets.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a semantic link h in the minimum semantic cover can be derived out by j k -> h, and the determining set of h does not include j or k, h should not be in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The closure of original CPSocio-SLN, the minimum spanning graph set of every semantic link in original CPSocio-SLN, and new link e which has already been added to the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Semantic link u'\u0392' could be derived from semantic link u'\u0391' and semantic link u'\u0398' according to some rules, e.g.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Note that the semantic links in the minimum semantic cover may also be derived out by other semantic links in CPSocio-SLN.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The third ef u'\ufb01' cient storage strategy is to save both the semantic closure and the minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN so that we can operate on the minimum semantic cover and can query on the closure.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As shown in Figure 7, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e10, and e11 are the semantic links in the minimum semantic cover, other semantic links are derived.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Semantic links are only determined by the semantic links in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If a CPSocio-SLN only has one semantic link, this link's minimum spanning graph set only has one minimum spanning graph which is this semantic link itself.</a>
