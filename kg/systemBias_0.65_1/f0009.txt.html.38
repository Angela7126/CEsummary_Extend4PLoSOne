<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A semantic link's minimum spanning graph set is a graph set of these minimum spanning graphs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Adding a semantic link between two nodes and then deleting it, the minimum semantic cover of the CPSocio-SLN may be changed.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The evolution of semantic link network is based on inter-resource semantic links.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If a CPSocio-SLN only has one semantic link, this link's minimum spanning graph set only has one minimum spanning graph which is this semantic link itself.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(2) Save the minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If a link's minimum spanning graph set has a minimum spanning graph that includes ek, then delete this minimum spanning graph.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Hence, e7 should be in the important minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>hence the minimum semantic cover for a CPSocio-SLN is not unique.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>As shown in Figure 7, e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e10, and e11 are the semantic links in the minimum semantic cover, other semantic links are derived.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Hence, we should u'\ufb01' nd a way to obtain the minimum spanning graph of every semantic link.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>After checking all links' minimum spanning graph set, we can get a link set, links in this set have the same rank and links that are not in the set have a smaller rank.</a>
