<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Understanding a representation requires users to have knowledge (e.g., the knowledge of number), which is the basis for understanding and representation.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The generative model is to simulate the process of understanding and writing (Wittrock, 1974).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is the basis of managing, analyzing and making use of big data.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is the main research aim of data mining, text mining and data science (Fayyad, 1996).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Research on semiotics and grounding symbols is to enrich the semantics of symbols (Roy, 2005).</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Knowledge is the source and the result of data analysis.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Tracing the origin of big data research and linking big data to behavior, knowledge and cyber-infrastructure is a way to explore big data methodology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The intelligence and personal knowledge of a cognitive system can be examined by Turing test (Turing, 1950).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The key to solve the problem is the establishment, recognition, derivation and integration of semantics on data.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(3) The decentralized complex processes consisting of computing, control and communication.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For simplification, the representation of knowledge (Rep(K)) is denoted as a link in the tables.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A representation suitable for machine processing is hard to be explained by the representation of human (e.g., language).</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A major shortcoming of the current data systems, information systems or knowledge systems is that data, information and knowledge are not significantly distinguished.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>So, it is meaningless to prove the correctness of a representation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(4) Discover the relations in the target domain, and examine the relations in the conjecture of the solution.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The goal guides the selection of the next word and the selection of a concept, and links the word to the concept.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>(3) The representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>It remembers, associates and forgets to evolve the impression of concepts.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The nature of human representation and machine representation is different.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(3) The ability of proposing problem and solving problem.</a>
