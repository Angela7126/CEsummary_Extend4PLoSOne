<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Humans represent what they have seen or felt as semantic images in the mental space through interacting and experiencing in the physical space, and summarizing representations and revising representations during communicating with each other in social space where motivations are generated.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A semantic link network of video components enables users to query the interested components and navigates in the network according to interest, e.g., the semantic link network of video components can help play the main thread of a story development.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If representation A cites a set of representations B, and A is cited by a set of representations C, then both B and C constitute the extension of A.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>From this point of view, summarization can be regarded as a transformation of reducing the dimensions of a representation so that the dimensions of representation can be linked to and merge with the dimensions in the mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The physical space including the nature and versatile artificial physical space like museum can be represented as a space of multiple dimensions such as time, region, and type (different types of museums may include different samples).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The main purpose of summarizing pictures is to generate a small set of pictures from a large set of pictures according to interest.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Transform pictures into texts according to the way described in (1), summarize the texts, and then select a picture to represent the summary by matching its tags and the core words of the summary.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.</a>
