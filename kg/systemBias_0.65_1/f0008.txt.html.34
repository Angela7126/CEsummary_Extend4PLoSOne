<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to the membership probability on each coordinate, the membership probability on each axis/point in a probabilistic resource space can be calculated by the following methods.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Without knowing the relations between coordinates, and the relations between coordinate and axis, it is difficult to calculate the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point according to the membership probability that the resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The hierarchical resource space can be transformed into the equivalent u'\u2018' flat' resource space by projecting each leaf node of the coordinate tree onto the axis where the root resides [35][36], but this projection makes a resource space lose abstraction layers.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A resource space that does not satisfy 2NF is useful in applications since sometimes dependent coordinates cannot be avoided in applications due to the understanding gap between the resource space creater, the users who input resources, the users who retrieve resources, and the authors of the resources.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Then, a Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P- RSM, is proposed in section 3 by mapping the RSM into the probabilistic space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Therefore, the normal forms of a given resource space can be automatically verified according to the relations between concepts in the ontology.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If patterns in the resources to be managed are available, some advanced functions of the resource space such as automatic construction, adaptation, and uploading resources are feasible.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(2) Discover the resource pattern in the candidate resource set according to the classification trees of the resource space and the given matching degree.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a resource management model based on multi-dimensional classifications [35][36].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The resource space can automatically detect and upload resources by matching the pattern in resources and the classification trees of the resource space.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>To implement a smart resource space that can adapt itself, the resource space needs to trace the active points in the user's mental space and previous queries so that adaption is in line with the evolution of user's mental space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>This is because a resource in the probabilistic resource space can be inserted into a point if its membership probability belonging to this point is larger than 0.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For a resource space RS, the point query operation is for selecting the desirable points according to the given restrictions.</a>
