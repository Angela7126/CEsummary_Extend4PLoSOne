<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Ever since Descartes, philosophically minded people have wrestled with the question of whether it is possible for machines to think.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It won't be necessary for most people to know very much about how they work internally, but what we will have to know about them in order to use them is more complex than what we need to know about electric lights and telephones.</a>
