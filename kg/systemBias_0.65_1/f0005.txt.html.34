<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, big data analysis can only be effective when data analyzers have the knowledge of business strategies, and can link the potential insights to business opportunities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>A key task of data analysis is to select small number of dimensions, to ensure their independency and each of which can specify all data of the space so that all data can be access from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The linked data is a method of enabling data on the Web from different sources to be connected and queried based on Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF, www.w3.org/RDF/), Web Ontology Language (OWL, www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and SPARQL query language for RDF (www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This fundamental problem is necessary to be revisited in big data research because tremendous efforts have been made to extract knowledge from data and many researchers aim at extracting knowledge from big data.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A big idea in computing history is to transform the thinking computing model u'\u23af' u'\uf8e7' Turing machine into an implementation model by viewing program as data and enabling programs to be fetched and stored in the same way as data (Neumann, 1958).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Different data sets should be selected from the big data according to different strategies (e.g., on product distribution, price, and business network).</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The information modeling system transforms data (e.g., texts) into information with computable information models (e.g., proposition network, cognitive map, probability models and generative models) and measures (e.g., measuring information quantity in text) through reading, or transforms information into text(s) according to information models (e.g., generative model).</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If a system cannot answer a question but it can do within the given time after inputting the data (including tables, texts, images, videos), then we say that the system has obtained certain knowledge from the data and it has the ability of processing the data.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>This problem involves in the global accessibility between data, which is beyond the volume, velocity, variety and veracity features of big data because it concerns infrastructure.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Social networks form communities in society, which divides people and data they generate and use with the evolution of the communities.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Big data about human behaviors provides the sources for discovering, estimating and creating requirements, which drive the behaviors of operating the observed system.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>People can also directly analyze the data with aim and knowledge to generate knowledge by proposing and verifying assumptions.</a>
