<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>When we add a new semantic link to the network, more semantic links will emerge because of in u'\ufb02' uence and relational reasoning [6].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Adding a semantic link between two nodes and then deleting it, the minimum semantic cover of the CPSocio-SLN may be changed.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the semantic link to be deleted is not in the minimum semantic cover, the CPSocio-SLN equals to the original CPSocio-SLN after operating DelLink on it.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Hence, after adding (deleting) a semantic link, we cannot simply use the deleting (adding) operation to recover the CPSocio-SLN.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN is not unique, but the importance of different minimum semantic covers is different.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the semantic link to be added is in the closure of the CPSocio-SLN, the CPSocio-SLN equals to the original CPSocio-SLN after operating AddLink on it.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If adding any semantic link to the set will lead to the same effect, the link set is called equivalent link set.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Deleting a semantic link between two semantic nodes and then adding it between the same pair of nodes, this CPSocio-SLN is unchanged.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>hence the minimum semantic cover for a CPSocio-SLN is not unique.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Through analyzing the minimum spanning graph, we can obtain the algorithm of updating based on deleting a semantic link.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>(1) Carrying out reasoning and analysis on CPSocio-SLN according to the operations on the minimum semantic cover, maintaining the closure of CPSocio-SLN, and recording the place that needs to be modi u'\ufb01' ed in the minimum semantic cover.</a>
