<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>It won't be necessary for most people to know very much about how they work internally, but what we will have to know about them in order to use them is more complex than what we need to know about electric lights and telephones.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>And if all we wanted to think about were zero and one, we wouldn't bother with the concept of number.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If the machine may do something we don't know about but that can laterbe explained in relation to a goal, we have no choice but to use 'is trying' or some synonym to explain the behavior.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>We may say of an automatic teller machine, 'It thinks I don't have enough money in my account because it doesn't yet know about the deposit I made this morning.</a>
