<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This axiom is the basis of representation (including using languages) and summarization (especially, for multi-document summarization).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Humans have the ability to summarize non-symbol representations, which can be regarded as a different dimension from text.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A text can be understood from different aspects because of the nature of language use and understanding.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>a) Use pictures to replace the corresponding representations in the original text, to summarize the rest representation, and to organize the summary according to the original structure.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>d) Classifying pictures from multiple dimensions including time and location, which help distinguish pictures of different dimensions so that appropriate pictures can be selected to match the text in the summary.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If we regard a text as a graph of words or sentences, text summarization can be regarded as a problem of summarizing a semantic link network [Zhuge, 2009], where nodes and edges can be texts, pictures and videos.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Different from previous notions of summarization, this definition gives the minimum summary (the summary of the intention) and the maximum summary (the summary of the intention and the extension) of a representation, and it regards citation as the fundamental behavior and mechanism of summarization.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A solution is to discover the communities of the semantic link network of pictures, to select one text to represent one community according to the tags of pictures within the community, and to construct a semantic link network of the representative texts.</a>
