<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(3) Co-experiencing in the physical space, socio space, cyber space and artifact space establishes the semantic links through the socio space, physical space, artifact space and cyber space, and evolves the semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>the classes of two ends, the semantic link triangle that contains the semantic link, the classes (subclass and superclass) in the classification hierarchy corresponding to the semantic link indicator, the rules that use or derive the semantic link, and the use cases of the semantic link.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Humans emerge semantic images in mind, use languages to indicate semantic image, use sketch to describe semantic image, develop a sketch toward a design, and model a design in the cyber space or in the artifact space as a prototype.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The semantic image of an SLN emerges in the mental space when the symbols link to the sense and to existing semantic images through the physiological space and psychological space.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In addition to the reflection through the cyber space and artifact space, direct reflection from the physical space and the socio space are important to establish the right semantic images in the mental space.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Mental Space <-- Cyber Space --> Socio Space, which facilitates the interaction between the mental space and the socio space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(3) Rules is a set of rules such that new semantic links can be appropriately added or the implicit semantic links can be found between semantic nodes as the effect of interaction, reasoning, influence, or evolution.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
