<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The key is to establish and maintain the semantic links between peers according to their schemas, and to develop routing strategies that can make use of the links.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Different from other individuals, humans can actively link symbols to the physical space, and to the socio space through the physiological space, psychological space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Languages are rules of composing symbols for indicating and linking semantic images in the mental space during interaction [24].</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This leads to the formation and evolution of diverse semantic communities.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As the effect of learning and using languages for interaction, languages develop with the evolution of the mental space and the symbol space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Firstly, individuals can only know a small part of the large-scale networks due to energy limitation and privacy.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(1) Selecting the situation for reflection according to the active points in the mental space reflecting the physical, physiological, psychological, and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Adding a time dimension to the multi-dimensional classification space can form the space for showing the change of resources when compressing and stretching the time dimension [82].</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>(9) Emerging a semantic image according to a given network in the physical space or socio space.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>So, the creation of a semantic link depends not only on the neighbor links and rules but also on interactions.</a>
