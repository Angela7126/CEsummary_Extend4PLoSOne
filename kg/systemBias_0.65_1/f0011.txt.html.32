<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The Semantic Web is to represent the semantics in documents so that machines can behave more intelligently according to comprehension of documents on the Web.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Classi u'\ufb01' cation methods generate classes and the classes of classes (i.e., super-class).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, AI concerns human intelligence, knowledge, and intelligent machines.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As social semantics, interactive semantics emphasizes on the evolution of semantic images rather than accurate representation.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Different from natural languages and machine languages, art languages render the theme of artwork.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The less information a semantic path contains, the easier people understand and remember.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The SLN of texts enables individuals to read and write in natural languages through semantic lens so that a piece of text can be viewed from different facets, abstraction levels, scales and versions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Different semantic links can be added to the same pair of points so multiple semantic images can be established on the same set of points.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Further, when an individual reads the text, the words will be associated with the experiences in the points of the multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space, therefore, a semantic image (a semantic link network of experience) emerges.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>The semantic link network (SLN) and the classi u'\ufb01' cation space can be integrated by mapping the nodes or communities in the semantic link network into the points or subspaces of the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Based on the mappings, complementing or integrating existing models can obtain new capacity of semantic modeling [49].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>It enables the semantic lens to sense and make use of sounds based on the mappings between sound, event, scene and object.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The time dimension records the time of interaction, event occurrence, and adding a semantic link to the semantic link network so that the semantic lens can show semantic image through time.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>As the consequence, classi u'\ufb01' cation trees are constituted.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Knowing the relation between the richness of single media, the richness of channels, and indicators helps build and rebuild semantic images [14,38].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>6 shows a process of rebuilding the semantic image of the Newton law of motion through inventing, learning, teaching and learning the law.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The key issue is how to automatically link diverse types of resources and coordinate semantic link networks according to diverse individuals' interests that may change from time to time.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>For example, semantic images corresponding to the words in text continuously emerge during reading, and words are selected according to the semantic images emerged during writing.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Due to the dynamic and self-organized nature of the semantic link network, semantic images may be different at different time.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>An object is recognized if a point containing the item of the similar object is found in the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>Teachers read the papers and books to rebuild the semantic image about the law, and then externalize it by writing textbooks, which enrich the explanation and indication of the law.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>A semantic link network SLN may change when adding a semantic link l to the network and then remove it, because the semantic links derived from the network with l may not be derived from the network without l.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>A new semantic image emerges when the weights are adapted according to the sensing object or scene.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>Different from the centrality principle in general network, linking a new node or adding a new semantic link to a semantic link network could generate new semantic links due to relational reasoning on semantic links.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>(2) The status of the system is uncertain due to the uncertain and undecidable behavior of individuals.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Current e-presence techniques can capture the videos, photos, audios, texts and their synchronization relations of human presence and replay them according to the synchronization relations.</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>A continuous moving scene will be captured according to the weights of the matched points.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The following operations are for composing a set of indicators K1, K2, ..., and Kn by making abstraction.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>The explanation function indicates or explains the semantics of the input and output based on ISB.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>Zooming may be navigated between different types of SLNs or between points in a classi u'\ufb01' cation space by changing the focus according to interest.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Therefore, the lens can zoom onto the semantic link network from the classi u'\ufb01' cation space or zoom onto the classi u'\ufb01' cation space from the semantic link network.</a>
