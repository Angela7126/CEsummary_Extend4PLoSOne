<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As human behaviors will influence the physical space, physiological space, psychological space, and socio space through the cyber space, previous security issues isolated in one space will pass through multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(9) Emerging a semantic image according to a given network in the physical space or socio space.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>As shown in Fig.16, thoughts are inspired by the requirements raised in the socio space and the co-experiences in the physical space, socio space, artifact space, physiological space, and psychological space.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>As depicted in Fig.10 (c), the cyber space can visualize the semantic link networks for humans to operate according to the semantic images in mind.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Languages are rules of composing symbols for indicating and linking semantic images in the mental space during interaction [24].</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>(1) The cyber space can reflect more of the physical space and socio space by using the advanced sensors, actuators, interactive interfaces, and link situation in different spaces to provide cyber-physical-socio services.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Versatile semantic nodes, semantic links and rules can be added to SLN at any time.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
