<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If asked to tell what it is doing, humans or some machine will tell about their choices for action and say that they intend to determine which action leads to the best consequence.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If so, they have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The whole apparatus is visible to the ape, so it can see the consequences of each choice.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>intentional behavior, because full generality is beyond the state of the art.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>He considers that freedom evolves in such a way as to make more and more events evitable, especially events that are bad for the organism.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If we wanted robots susceptible to schizophrenia, we would have to program in something like schizophrenia, and it would be a complicated and unmotivated undertaking -- unmotivated by anything but the goal of imitating human schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Just as with equation (1), we can say that person chooses an action that leads to more freedom at the next situation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>So far as I can see, no animals consider the consequences of alternative actions;</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Thus "If I make this move, my opponent (or nature regarded as an opponent) will have the following choices, each of which will give me further choices.</a>
