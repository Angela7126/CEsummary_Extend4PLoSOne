<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Ever since Descartes, philosophically minded people have wrestled with the question of whether it is possible for machines to think.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As our daily lives involve ever more sophisticated computers, we will find that ascribing little thoughts to machines will be increasingly useful in understanding how to get the most good out of them.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to some authorities, to use these words, the language of the mind, to talk about machines is to commit the error of anthropomorphism.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It won't be necessary for most people to know very much about how they work internally, but what we will have to know about them in order to use them is more complex than what we need to know about electric lights and telephones.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>First we want to provide machines with theories of knowledge and belief so they can reason about what their users know, don't know, and want.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>I suppose some philosophers, psychologists, and English teachers would maintain that the blanket manufacturer is guilty of anthropomorphism and some will claim that great harm can come from thus ascribing to machines qualities which only humans can have.</a>

<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>In this we try to understand the behavior of a system by ascribing to it beliefs, goals, intentions, likes and dislikes, and other mental qualities.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the machine may do something we don't know about but that can laterbe explained in relation to a goal, we have no choice but to use 'is trying' or some synonym to explain the behavior.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>A more elaborate automatic teller that handles loans, loan payments, traveler's checks, and so forth, may have beliefs like, 'The payment wasn't made on time,' or, 'This person is a good credit risk.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It doesn't commit the person who said it to an elaborate view of the mind of a dog.</a>
