<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>However, big data analysis can only be effective when data analyzers have the knowledge of business strategies, and can link the potential insights to business opportunities.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Machines can process data with certain representations (including models) designed by human, so the key to processing big data is the representation of data with the "big" features.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, it requests a representation that can help human recognize the complex system that generates big data.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This requests data management system to manage not only data but also the networks that generate and use data.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Knowledge is the source and the result of data analysis.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>(2) Mapping data into great knowledge needs important data that indicate great knowledge and the ability of mapping data into knowledge through a great mind that can carry out information modeling, cognitive modeling and knowledge management.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(2) Separating data processing system, information system, cognitive modeling system, and knowledge system, and maximizing their capabilities by enabling them to focus on doing one thing, because the capabilities and challenges of data processing systems, information systems and knowledge systems are different.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A key task of data analysis is to select small number of dimensions, to ensure their independency and each of which can specify all data of the space so that all data can be access from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Social networks form communities in society, which divides people and data they generate and use with the evolution of the communities.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>It is the cognitive systems that discover knowledge through interacting with the physical space, representing information, building concepts, proposing and verifying assumptions in the representation space, and externalizing knowledge with a certain form of representation.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The basic problem of big data is to formulate problems from big data.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>This problem involves in the global accessibility between data, which is beyond the volume, velocity, variety and veracity features of big data because it concerns infrastructure.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>Different data sets should be selected from the big data according to different strategies (e.g., on product distribution, price, and business network).</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The unconventional mapping is open as the information modeling system can also receive new information and models, the cognitive modeling system can receive concepts and rules, and the knowledge space modeling system can receive concepts, rules and structures from external systems including other computing systems, human and society.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>A multi-dimensional classification space can be designed by human according to domain analysis or automatically generated by extracting dimensions from the representations of data.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Big data about human behaviors provides the sources for discovering, estimating and creating requirements, which drive the behaviors of operating the observed system.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>People can also directly analyze the data with aim and knowledge to generate knowledge by proposing and verifying assumptions.</a>
