<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>If we can put a Graphical query interface on the front of this, and a good data visualization system on the output, we should be able to allow astronomers to do data analysis without having to write programs.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Computing involves progress in many areas, data visualization, human-computer interfaces (vision, speech, robotics), mobile applications (wireless and batteries), micro-electron-mechanical-systems (MEMS), and the more prosaic areas of networking, processing, and data storage and access.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This may mean that we replicate data near the processors, and it argues against a design that has processors in one place and data stores in another.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>I think astronomy data is the best playpen for us computer scientists to experiment with data analysis and summarization techniques.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>In order for the archives to cooperate and in order for astronomers to compare data from multiple archives, the data in each archive needs to have a clear description of what it means.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>There have also been great advances in data mining technology for massive data sets -- mostly being used in the commercial sector.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Certainly FITS is a good way of representing astronomy data sets for data interchange.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>It seems likely that there are strong ties between this spatial data and the spatial data in the astronomy community.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Even within these classic areas, I am going to go light on topics such as object-oriented programming, databases, data visualization, data mining, and the open source movement.</a>
