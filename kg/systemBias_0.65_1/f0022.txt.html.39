<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Therefore, the total number of vertical dominoes is the sum of seven odd numbers and hence odd.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Likewise the number from the second to the third is odd, etc.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, this argument is at a meta-level to the Minsky and Stefanuk proofs and therefore can't claim to be non-creative.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>We regard this proof as creative, because it involves an element not present in the formulation of the problem -- namely the colors of the squares.</a>
