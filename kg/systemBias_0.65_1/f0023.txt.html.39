<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>We have maintained that the basic notion of free will is the same for humans, animals and robots.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>In general the theory will remain partly non-deterministic, but if there are occurrence axioms specifying what events occur in all situations, then the theory becomes deterministic, i.e.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If asked to tell what it is doing, humans or some machine will tell about their choices for action and say that they intend to determine which action leads to the best consequence.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Adding occurrence axioms, which assert that certain actions occur, makes a theory more deterministic by specifying that certain events occur in situations satisfying specified conditions.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If so, they have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(1) includes the non-deterministic of Result used to compute which action leads to the better situation.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>It may be based on a more basic ability to predict something about what future will result from the occurrence of certain events including actions.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The whole apparatus is visible to the ape, so it can see the consequences of each choice.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So far as I can see, no animals consider the consequences of alternative actions;</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Just as with equation (1), we can say that person chooses an action that leads to more freedom at the next situation.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>He considers that freedom evolves in such a way as to make more and more events evitable, especially events that are bad for the organism.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>intentional behavior, because full generality is beyond the state of the art.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The older McNachten criterion, "unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts", uses essentially the criteria of the present article for assessing the presence or absence of free will.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>I am doubtful about the generalization, because I don't see how to represent commonsense preferences between actions except in terms of preferring one resulting situation to another.</a>
