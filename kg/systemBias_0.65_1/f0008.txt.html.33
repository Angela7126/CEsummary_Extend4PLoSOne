<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>According to the membership probability on each coordinate, the membership probability on each axis/point in a probabilistic resource space can be calculated by the following methods.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Therefore, the normal forms of a given resource space can be automatically verified according to the relations between concepts in the ontology.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>According to above definition, any resource r in a probabilistic resource space RS(X1, ..., Xn) can have n membership probabilistic functions corresponding to the axes.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Then, a Probabilistic Resource Space Model, P- RSM, is proposed in section 3 by mapping the RSM into the probabilistic space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>For a resource space RS, the point query operation is for selecting the desirable points according to the given restrictions.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point is a complex probabilistic event.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>7 for example, the resource space RS(Classes, Courses, Gender) is used to manage student information according to their classes, courses and gender.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If patterns in the resources to be managed are available, some advanced functions of the resource space such as automatic construction, adaptation, and uploading resources are feasible.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The 2NF of RSM is to eliminate the dependency between coordinates so that a resource can be accurately located according to coordinates.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Classification is the most basic method for organizing various resources in the cyber space, physical space, socio space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The Resource Space Model (RSM) is a resource management model based on multi-dimensional classifications [35][36].</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Given the ontology of a domain, coordinates can be accurately specified by a set of concepts in the ontology.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Without knowing the relations between coordinates, and the relations between coordinate and axis, it is difficult to calculate the membership probability that a resource belongs to an axis or a point according to the membership probability that the resource belongs to each coordinate.</a>
