<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The SkyServer, SkyQuery, and many other ideas described here were developed by the team consisting of Tamas Budavari, Gyorgy Fekete, Nolan Li, Maria NietoSantisteban, William O'Mullane, Peter Kuntz, Don Slutz, Chris Stoughton, and Ani Thakar.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Recently we have been refining and extending our spatial access techniques , redoing our design in light of the revolution in database architectures (the unification of data and methods), and also preparing for the next-generation surveys which will be capturing a thousand times more data.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Domain scientists, notably NCBI (ncbi.nih.gov) and the World Wide Telescope (WWT, ivoa.net), are making heroic efforts to address these information management problems.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given these observations, it seems obvious that the Visualization and Analysis computer scientists can help improve existing systems, but that the logical progression is for the systems people to build a "rationalized base" and then for the Algorithms and Visualization people to build new tools atop that base.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>(1) users can define personal databases that represent their "workspace" on the server, and (2) users can submit longrunning queries to a batch system that schedules these jobs and deposits the answers into the user's personal database.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Computer scientists have struggled with and modeled discrete event system with tools like simulation languages, process algebras, and temporal logics.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The code to schedule and "drill" the fiber plate to take spectra was huge and poorly understood -- so the astronomers could not change it easily to address this custom problem.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The result is that the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, Space Telescope Institute, Cornell, Caltech, and NOAO have each been able to leverage this software base.</a>
