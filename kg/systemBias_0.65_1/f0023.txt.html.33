<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>We have maintained that the basic notion of free will is the same for humans, animals and robots.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Since there may be many different events that can occur in s, and the theory of the function Result does not say which occurs, the theory is nondeterministic.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If asked to tell what it is doing, humans or some machine will tell about their choices for action and say that they intend to determine which action leads to the best consequence.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>intentional behavior, because full generality is beyond the state of the art.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The whole apparatus is visible to the ape, so it can see the consequences of each choice.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If so, they have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It seems to me that formulas (1) and (2) expressing the use of the branching time Result(e,s) function in determining what events occur make the philosophical ideas definite.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Thus we can see which modifications of the notions are compatible with (1) and (2), and which require different axioms.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Chess programs do compare the consequences of various moves, and so have free will in the sense of this article.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>My notion of free will does not involve this, because the choice between actions a1 and a2 is symmetric.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>He considers that freedom evolves in such a way as to make more and more events evitable, especially events that are bad for the organism.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>If we wanted robots susceptible to schizophrenia, we would have to program in something like schizophrenia, and it would be a complicated and unmotivated undertaking -- unmotivated by anything but the goal of imitating human schizophrenia.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If a training set of (say) 32 combinations permits the ape to do the remaining 32 without further trial and error, it would be reasonable to conclude that the ape can predict the effects of the successive bounces.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Thus "If I make this move, my opponent (or nature regarded as an opponent) will have the following choices, each of which will give me further choices.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Just as with equation (1), we can say that person chooses an action that leads to more freedom at the next situation.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>If the ape can mentally follow the prize as it would bounce from baffle to baffle, it will succeed.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>I am doubtful about the generalization, because I don't see how to represent commonsense preferences between actions except in terms of preferring one resulting situation to another.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>According to Dennett (phone conversation), some recent experiments suggest that apes sometimes consider the consequences of alternate actions.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Thus whether the translation of a text is indeterminate depends on the length of the text.</a>
