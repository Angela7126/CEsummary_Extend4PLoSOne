<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If it is not there, the processor has to go to the L3 cache (typically main memory of a few Gigabytes).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>In that time, a modern processor can execute 4 instructions in parallel, if all the data is available (a quad issue processor).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Therefore is increasingly important that large computations lay the data out on disk in a sequential order, and scan it sequentially if possible.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the data is not there, the processor has to go to the level 2 cache (a few megabytes) that are typically 10 clocks away.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If you include all the film, all the music, all the photos, and images of all the books, then LC is a few tens of Petabytes.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Although computers are getting faster, the speed of light is not changing (so if you want to get data from the other coast, you must wait 60 milliseconds (request-response round-trip time)).</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>My simple advice is to stick with low degrees of SMP and work hard on program locality so that you have streamed access to the memory.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If you compute something today, the computation in 3t years will run 8 times faster and be 8 times cheaper (so do not bother to store it, just re-compute it if you do not expect to access it in the interim.</a>
