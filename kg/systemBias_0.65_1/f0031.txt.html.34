<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Here we describe a plan to develop an Internet data resource in astronomy to help address this problem in which, because of the nature of the data and analyses required of them, the data remain widely distributed rather than gathered in one or a few databases (e.g., GenBank).</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Astronomy data needs to be calibrated for the transmission of the atmosphere and for the response of the instruments.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>It will be up to the query system to locate the appropriate data sets, subset them, and cross-correlate them, returning the requested attributes from each data source.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>As the programs evolve, the computer science challenge is to automate these tasks of configuring and tracking replicas and of tracking data lineage and dependencies on different derived data versions.</a>
