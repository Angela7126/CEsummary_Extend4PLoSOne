<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>So, shared disk systems have morphed to partitioned served-disk systems to improve locality.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So, paradoxically, shared memory systems have been successful by adopting a shared-nothing software architecture.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Persistent data is stored in a database partitioned among several servers, and these servers are packed, so that if one server fails, another member of the pack can provide access to the failed server's database.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Now most modern database systems offer database replication -- and the feature is widely used to geoplex data and to provide fallback service.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>So, paradoxically, shared-memory and shared-disk systems are becoming shared-nothing systems as they aim for better data locality.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>that appear to be sharing disks are actually very impressive served disk systems with impressive cache management.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Today, several vendors are shipping systems that scale to 32 or 64 processors, with either a uniform memory access (UMA) or non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Taking Microsoft as an example, the most spectacular MSN outages of late have been due to operations mistakes (misconfigured a router) and sabotage (denial of service attacks).</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>In retrospect this was due to a bus rather than switched memory interconnect, unsophisticated cache management, and ignorant software.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>These ScaleOut systems are impressive.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The next step is to have redundant servers and a load balancing system that can redistribute the load as servers fail.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>The client database has a cache of all the data needed to take the client orders and is completely decoupled from the backend server that deals with other less-reliable services.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Some impressive systems run by tiny staffs, but the norm is that operations and management consumes huge budgets.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Clones, packs, load balancing, failover, and fallback all improve availability -- and they are all automatic.</a>
