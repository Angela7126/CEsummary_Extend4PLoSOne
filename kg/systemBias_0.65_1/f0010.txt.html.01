<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>After documents are clustered, some semantic links between documents, semantic associations between document clusters, semantic associations between keywords, and semantic links between documents and clusters can be discovered and inserted into the SLN-D.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Then, the statistical inference rules of semantic links are updated, the keywords of document clusters change and the document classi u'\ufb01' cation rules are also recalculated.</a>
