<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A person who doesn't know Chinese memorizes a book of rules for manipulating Chinese characters.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Searle says that since the person in the example doesn't understand Chinese -- even though he can produce intelligent Chinese conversation by following rules -- a computer cannot be said to 'understand' things.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>We suppose that the rules result in a Chinese conversation so intelligent that the person giving and receiving the sentences can't tell him from an intelligent Chinese.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>He is repeatedly given Chinese sentences, to which he applies the rules, and gives back what turn out, because of the clever rules, to be Chinese sentences that are appropriate replies.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>I would argue that the set of rules understands Chinese, and, analogously, a computer program may be said to understand things, even if the computer does not.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>He makes no distinction, however, between the hardware (the person) and the process (the set of rules).</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The rules tell him how to extract certain parts of a sequence of characters, how to re-arrange them, and how finally to send back another sequence of characters.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>These rules say nothing about the meaning of the characters, just how to compute with them.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The next example is adapted from the University of California philosopher John Searle.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Both Searle and I are ignoring practical difficulties like how long it would take a person with a rule book to come up with a reply.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>This is analogous to a computer, which only obeys its programming language, but can be programmed such that one can communicate with it in a different programming language, or in English.</a>
