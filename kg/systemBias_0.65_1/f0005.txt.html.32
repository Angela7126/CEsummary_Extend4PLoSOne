<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The linked data is a method of enabling data on the Web from different sources to be connected and queried based on Web standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF, www.w3.org/RDF/), Web Ontology Language (OWL, www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) and SPARQL query language for RDF (www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Big data generated by a complex system reflect the status and behavior of the system.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This problem involves in the global accessibility between data, which is beyond the volume, velocity, variety and veracity features of big data because it concerns infrastructure.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Social networks form communities in society, which divides people and data they generate and use with the evolution of the communities.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>So, it is meaningless to prove the correctness of a representation.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>However, it is difficult for computer to determine and derive the meaning of representations, to calculate meaning, and to explain result.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>A key task of data analysis is to select small number of dimensions, to ensure their independency and each of which can specify all data of the space so that all data can be access from different dimensions.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Therefore, a cognitive system with computing knowledge and domain knowledge is important to discover the evidence or implication in big data to support research, decision and inspire thinking.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Big Data will help predict the possibility to increase productivity, quality and flexibility and thus to understand the advantages of competition.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Different data sets should be selected from the big data according to different strategies (e.g., on product distribution, price, and business network).</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>A decision of citing relevant papers is made through searching, reading, and selecting behaviors on the same set of papers.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Knowledge is the source and the result of data analysis.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>So, it requests a representation that can help human recognize the complex system that generates big data.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>It is a natural idea to automatically extract knowledge from data by mapping the representation of data into the representation of knowledge.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>It leads to the border of knowledge and essential reinvention.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The class definition in object-oriented programming can be the basic structure for concepts as it facilitates computers to model class and abstraction, which are the basic features of concepts.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>It is the cognitive systems that discover knowledge through interacting with the physical space, representing information, building concepts, proposing and verifying assumptions in the representation space, and externalizing knowledge with a certain form of representation.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The main purpose of analyzing human behavior is to find, understand and estimate various requirements so as to effectively operate the observed system (e.g., organize resources for production) to provide on-demand products or services.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Therefore, chief information officers need to share knowledge with the heads of business departments to find the business opportunities indicated by big data.</a>
