<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>but, start a collaboration with some scientists and over time broaden that collaboration to work cross multiple disciplines.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Once the data is loaded, cognoscenti can do wonders, but "normals" do not have the data analysis skills to pose queries and to visualize answers.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>So, we automated the loading process with a workflow system built atop SQLserver and its Data Transformation Service (DTS.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The result is that the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh, Space Telescope Institute, Cornell, Caltech, and NOAO have each been able to leverage this software base.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As the community evolves, and as some scientists master these skills, they communicate successful patterns to their colleagues -- that is how scientific techniques evolve.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Given these observations, it seems obvious that the Visualization and Analysis computer scientists can help improve existing systems, but that the logical progression is for the systems people to build a "rationalized base" and then for the Algorithms and Visualization people to build new tools atop that base.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>So, scientists must to learn to move the questions-and-answers across the internet, and do the data analysis near the data whenever possible.</a>
