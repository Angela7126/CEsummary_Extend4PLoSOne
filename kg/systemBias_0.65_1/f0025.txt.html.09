<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>In such a theory, formulas express relations among contexts would be primary rather than the propositions true in the contexts.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>These applications require associating contexts with sentences or parts of sentences.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>10) We advocate using propositions as discussed in [McC79] for the objects true in contexts rather than logical or natural language sentences.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Here are some applications of the logical theory of contexts.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This has the advantage that the set of propositions true in a context may be finite when the set of sentences that can express these propositions will be infinite.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>2) Sentences about propositions and contexts are built up from a formula ist(c,p) which is to be understood as asserting that the proposition p is true in the context c.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Any given set of sentences including contexts can always be flattened (at the cost of lengthening) to eliminate explicit contexts.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>9) There is often a theory associated with a context|the set of sentences true in the context.</a>
