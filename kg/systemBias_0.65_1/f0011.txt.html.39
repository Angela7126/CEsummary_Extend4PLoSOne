<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>The time dimension records the time of interaction, event occurrence, and adding a semantic link to the semantic link network so that the semantic lens can show semantic image through time.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The semantic link network (SLN) and the classi u'\ufb01' cation space can be integrated by mapping the nodes or communities in the semantic link network into the points or subspaces of the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Classi u'\ufb01' cation methods generate classes and the classes of classes (i.e., super-class).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>a semantic image has the priority of emerge if it is linked to an emerging semantic image by a semantic link or a potential semantic link that can be derived from reasoning, or if it is indicated by an emerging semantic image through some heuristic rules.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Further, when an individual reads the text, the words will be associated with the experiences in the points of the multi-dimensional classi u'\ufb01' cation space, therefore, a semantic image (a semantic link network of experience) emerges.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Therefore, the lens can zoom onto the semantic link network from the classi u'\ufb01' cation space or zoom onto the classi u'\ufb01' cation space from the semantic link network.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The Semantic Web is to represent the semantics in documents so that machines can behave more intelligently according to comprehension of documents on the Web.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Due to the dynamic and self-organized nature of the semantic link network, semantic images may be different at different time.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Different from the centrality principle in general network, linking a new node or adding a new semantic link to a semantic link network could generate new semantic links due to relational reasoning on semantic links.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different semantic links can be added to the same pair of points so multiple semantic images can be established on the same set of points.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>A semantic link network SLN may change when adding a semantic link l to the network and then remove it, because the semantic links derived from the network with l may not be derived from the network without l.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>As social semantics, interactive semantics emphasizes on the evolution of semantic images rather than accurate representation.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>Individuals build their own semantic images based on semantic worldview while leaving tracks in the semantic image of the system.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>It enables the semantic lens to sense and make use of sounds based on the mappings between sound, event, scene and object.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>The SLN of texts enables individuals to read and write in natural languages through semantic lens so that a piece of text can be viewed from different facets, abstraction levels, scales and versions.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>A new semantic image emerges when the weights are adapted according to the sensing object or scene.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>For example, semantic images corresponding to the words in text continuously emerge during reading, and words are selected according to the semantic images emerged during writing.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>With constant interaction, a classi u'\ufb01' cation space will contain more dimensions and coordinates, and points will contain more object items, therefore an individual can rebuild richer semantic image when reading a set of indicators.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>The SLN of scenes enables the semantic lens to coordinate scenes so that relevant scenes can emerge when observing one scene.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>(6) <{Class(K1), Class(K2), ..., Class(Kn)}, L>, the semantic link network of the classes of indicators, L indicates the set of semantic links between classes.</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>The less information a semantic path contains, the easier people understand and remember.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>An object is recognized if a point containing the item of the similar object is found in the classi u'\ufb01' cation space.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>Further, relation l may be inferred by the other relations in the network shown as the dotted arrows according to some rules on semantic links [51].</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>As the consequence, classi u'\ufb01' cation trees are constituted.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>The key issue is how to automatically link diverse types of resources and coordinate semantic link networks according to diverse individuals' interests that may change from time to time.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>Knowing the relation between the richness of single media, the richness of channels, and indicators helps build and rebuild semantic images [14,38].</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>A semantic lens can focus on a semantic image within a range by giving a pair of classes or a pair of super-classes on the same abstraction path.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>The semantic image of community/ individual/object/relation has priority of emerging if it is distinguished from others for a certain period of time in interactive semantics.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Semantic image can also emerge according to the following richness principle, simplest (easy-to-understand) principle, distinguish principle, and relevance principle.</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>(2) Different indicators indicate the same semantic image to a certain degree if they are often referred by or refer to the same thing (e.g., relation, object, individual and class).</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Zooming may be navigated between different types of SLNs or between points in a classi u'\ufb01' cation space by changing the focus according to interest.</a>
