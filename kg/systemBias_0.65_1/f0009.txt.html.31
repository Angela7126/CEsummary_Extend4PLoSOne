<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>Adding a semantic link between two nodes and then deleting it, the minimum semantic cover of the CPSocio-SLN may be changed.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>A semantic link's minimum spanning graph set is a graph set of these minimum spanning graphs.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>When we add a new semantic link to the network, more semantic links will emerge because of in u'\ufb02' uence and relational reasoning [6].</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>hence the minimum semantic cover for a CPSocio-SLN is not unique.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Hence, e7 should be in the important minimum semantic cover.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The minimum semantic cover of CPSocio-SLN is not unique, but the importance of different minimum semantic covers is different.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The evolution of semantic link network is based on inter-resource semantic links.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If adding any semantic link to the set will lead to the same effect, the link set is called equivalent link set.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If the semantic link to be deleted is not in the minimum semantic cover, the CPSocio-SLN equals to the original CPSocio-SLN after operating DelLink on it.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>If a CPSocio-SLN only has one semantic link, this link's minimum spanning graph set only has one minimum spanning graph which is this semantic link itself.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>If a link's minimum spanning graph set has a minimum spanning graph that includes ek, then delete this minimum spanning graph.</a>
