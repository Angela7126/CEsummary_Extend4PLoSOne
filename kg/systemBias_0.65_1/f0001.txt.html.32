<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(5) The representation of knowledge is not unique, and the understanding of representation is not unique.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As a kind of language representation, summarization should be based on the basic principles of language use.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>This is because knowledge, interest and understanding are specific to people and change with the evolution of knowledge and society.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This paper attempts to explore the problem of summarization from multiple dimensions (especially from empiricism, rationalism, evolutionism, and social/individual constructionism) so as to form a general summarization methodology.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This is because authors have the knowledge for representation and the knowledge to be represented.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A text can be understood from different aspects because of the nature of language use and understanding.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>A good summary should be able to quickly attract attention, represent the core idea, and effectively convey the meaning according to interests.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This leads to the separation of author's meaning, summarizer's understanding, and readers' understanding.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This axiom is the basis of representation (including using languages) and summarization (especially, for multi-document summarization).</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from linear reading, a semantic link network enables readers to know a general view and the main measures of large representations immediately.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The basic behaviors of summarization include emerging, selecting, citing (explicitly or implicitly), and organizing representations according to requirement and motivation.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Humans have the ability to summarize non-symbol representations, which can be regarded as a different dimension from text.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>The openness principle implies that establishing static criteria for evaluating summarization is unnecessary, and that a closed system is incapable for reaching a satisfied summary.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The faceted navigation approach is not traditional text summarization, but it is a special summarization because it can extract different facets in large text(s) to enable users to read only the interested facet [Xu and Zhuge, 2012].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>A summary can be in form of a hypertext, where some texts are summarized as a hyperlink, and some texts containing hyperlinks are summarized as a hyperlink at the higher level.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>The semantic link networks of texts, pictures, tags and users indicate a kind of social semantics of picture usage and thus provide the ground for selection.</a>
