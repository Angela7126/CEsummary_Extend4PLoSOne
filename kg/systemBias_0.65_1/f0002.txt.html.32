<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>As a scientific research area evolves, the knowledge flow network evolves with the citation network and behaves differently during different phases.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The knowledge flow network implicit in the citation network consists of knowledge flows between nodes that process knowledge, including reasoning, fusing, generalizing, inventing, and problem solving, by authors and co-authors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Reflecting the development of a discipline, the distribution of knowledge energy in a network changes as its citation network evolves.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Based on the evolution of relevant knowledge flow networks, this service enables scientists to simulate and estimate the development of a discipline, and thus helps them plan research.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>This service can help scientists select peers by finding the dense cliques in knowledge flow networks by looking at the statistical results and distribution of authors, articles, and citations.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>Analyzing the relationship between authors, articles, and their citation network, the environment can automatically discover knowledge flow networks and can distinguish the type of knowledge nodes using ranking algorithms and trace their evolution.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>This implies a rising and expanding research group or community.</a>
