<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>RAID5 saves disk space (gigabytes) at the expense of more IOs for disk writes.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>(1) We can reduce disk accesses by caching popular (hot) pages in main memory, and writing a log of their changes to disk.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>(2) A random access costs a seek time, half a rotation time, and then the transfer time.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>* On random workloads, disk mirroring is preferable to RAID5 parity because it spends disk space (which is plentiful) to save disk accesses (which are precious).</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Ten years ago, disks offered 50 Kaps (kilobyte accesses per second) to 1GB of data, and 5-minute disk scan times.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This reduces random reads, and converts random writes to sequential (log) writes.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>So track-sized sequential transfers maximize disk bandwidth and arm utilization.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Such a tape archive is half the cost per terabyte of disk storage, but tape does not provide easy access to the data.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>The move to sequential disk IO is well underway.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>(8) In ten years RAM will cost what disk costs today.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>As already mentioned, caching, transaction logging, and log-structured file systems convert random writes into sequential writes.</a>
