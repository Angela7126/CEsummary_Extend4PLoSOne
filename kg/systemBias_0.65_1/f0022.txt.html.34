<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>A solution to a problem is creative if it involves concepts not present in statement of the problem and the general knowledge surrounding it.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The standard proof that this is impossible notes that a domino covers one black square and one white square, and therefore any covering by dominoes covers equal numbers of squares of the two colors.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Presumably not everyone would be able to push the argument through, because at some point you have to notice that although you get no contradiction from determining that there are an odd number of vertical dominoes, you also get an odd number of horizontal dominoes and an even number of dominoes altogether.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Axioms 13 and 14 insure that the dominoes don't overlap, axioms 6-12 insure that all squares but the corner squares are covered and axiom 15 insures that no dominoes stick out over the edge.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>Writing the propositional calculus formulas asserting that a domino projects in exactly one direction from each square, that there is a domino project back from a square into which a domino projects and that no domino projects off the board or into a forbidden square is taken as straightforward, i.e.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>As a small step toward programs that find creative solutions, we consider how to express the idea of a solution concisely.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>It is also incapable of expressing the counts of the numbers of squares with a given property, the latter being required for expressing the Minsky, Winograd and Stefanuk proofs.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The traditional proof and the proofs by Winograd, Minsky and Stefanuk can all be based on the following sentences of set theory axiomatized in first order logic.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Obviously it will be easier to make computers come up with creative solutions if the idea of the solution is just one thing -- whatever kind of thing that may be.</a>
