<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>u'\u2022' Attribute rule set AR consists of rules for discovering semantic links between documents according to the attributes of documents.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>The document classi u'\ufb01' cation rules are for classifying documents and discovering semantic links.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>It derives more semantic links by reasoning rules, and predicts the semantic links among documents according to the statistical inference rules.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>More semantic links can be derived out according to the discovered semantic links, existing semantic links and reasoning rules.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If T1 and T2 are keyword sets of documents d1 and d2 in the same cluster, semantic links between them such as similar, partOf and equal can be discovered according to the rules in Table II.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>After documents are clustered, some semantic links between documents, semantic associations between document clusters, semantic associations between keywords, and semantic links between documents and clusters can be discovered and inserted into the SLN-D.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Besides, if semantic links are considered, communities in the SLN can be discovered to support advanced applications on the SLN.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This type of rules can be obtained from the cluster networks and the keyword u'\u2013' document networks according to the Bayesian formula.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Potential semantic links can be derived from an existing SLN according to a set of reasoning rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>To discover the relations between two entities on the Web, document pairs containing potential semantic links are ranked based on the connecting words between documents [12].</a>
