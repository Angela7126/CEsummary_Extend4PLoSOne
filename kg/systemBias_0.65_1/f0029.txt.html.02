<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>After the coarse spatial match, different astronomers may want to use different morphological and attribute tests to detect spurious matches where a moving object has occluded or changed the attributes of some object or to tease apart adjacent members of a binary system.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>O1 was fully masked by a meteor trail, cosmic ray, satellite, moving object, passing airplane, or refraction of a bright object in run 2.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Given this rather low object surface density (when compared to the Galactic Plane or the Galactic Center), the techniques described here can find slowly moving objects by using a larger classification distance.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Given a point in one run, the probability in finding another point at a separation r in another run, given perfect accuracy is the sum of a Dirac delta for the object plus the contribution from a spatial correlation function (from clustering) and a random Poisson component.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A rigorous statistical argument, based on mean density and other parameters can recommend an optimal Bayes classification distance.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>We adopted the International Virtual Observatory definition for footprints [1] and have implemented a footprint service both inside SQL [2] and on the web [3, 4].</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Some studies are interested in moving objects and other studies are working with data collected over an epoch where the earth's observational position affects the object's relative position.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>create table BundleTemp( BundleID int identity primary key, run int, objectID int)</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Source code for these spatial functions (buffer, intersect, inside, fRegionGetObjectsFromRegionID, ..</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>In those cases the object's apparent movement may exceed the positional error, and therefore a larger threshold is needed for the match criterion.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>Our goal is to compute a table Match( run1, objectID1, run2, objectID2, hitOrMiss) Where the hitOrMiss field takes on one of the values Hit, Ephemeral, Masked, or Edge.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Having a short list of all candidate match objects allows more sophisticated tests to work much more quickly by limiting their search space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>For faint stellar and galactic objects, the apparent motion is typically much smaller and so the observations can be months or years apart and yet the techniques here can correlate the two observations.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>The position uncertainty or astrometric precision is often a constant for all objects of an observation, but when comparing data from different instruments or from times with different seeing, the position uncertainties may differ.</a>
