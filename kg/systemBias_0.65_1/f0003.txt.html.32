<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>user behaviors can be sensed and fed back to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to behave in the physical space through the cyber space.</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>The key is to establish and maintain the semantic links between peers according to their schemas, and to develop routing strategies that can make use of the links.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>A 5-tuple typed link (link type, source node, destination node, a set of structured link attributes, and a free text annotation to the link) is introduced [25].</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>For example, this enables e-learning systems to capture student behaviors during studying so that leaning materials and processes can be organized and adapted in real time to raise the effectiveness of study.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Different from other individuals, humans can actively link symbols to the physical space, and to the socio space through the physiological space, psychological space, and mental space.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>For example, the complex distance between individuals involved in a socio event can be defined according to the physical distances such as road length and straight-line distance, socio distances based on friendship or harmonious interaction, and symbol distances based on profiles.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>As a kind of mirror, the cyber space reflects the other spaces by recording and linking various interactions in other spaces [89].</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>(1) Selecting the situation for reflection according to the active points in the mental space reflecting the physical, physiological, psychological, and socio requirements.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Users in different regions will cooperatively accomplish tasks and solve problems by using various links to actively promote the flows of material, energy, technique, information, knowledge, and service in this environment.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>The linked data is to connect Web data based on URIs, HTTP, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and metadata.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Languages are rules of composing symbols for indicating and linking semantic images in the mental space during interaction [24].</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Adding a time dimension to the multi-dimensional classification space can form the space for showing the change of resources when compressing and stretching the time dimension [82].</a>
