<a name="0">[0]</a> <a href="#0" id=0>(1) The generation of the mental space to reflect various forms in the physical space and socio space as semantic images, to evolve the semantic images, to make abstraction and analogy by classification, linking and reasoning, to generate some flows through semantic images, and to emerge and re-emerge semantic images of different scales through the semantic lens [89].</a>
<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If socio individuals are abstracted as active semantic nodes and socio relations between individuals are abstracted as semantic links, the socio space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with socio rules and interactions.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>Abstracting behaviors as active semantic nodes and abstracting the relations between behaviors and the relations between the external situation and internal condition as semantic links, the psychological space can be regarded as a complex semantic link network evolving with psychological rules.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>Most previous computing techniques are for improving the cyber space, for example, the Semantic Web is to create machine-understandable semantics in the cyber space, the semantic net is to express knowledge in the cyber space, and the semantic link network is to reflect socio relations and the dynamicity in the cyber space.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If artifacts are abstracted as semantic nodes with function descriptions, and the relations between artifacts are abstracted as semantic links, the artifact space can be regarded as a semantic link network evolving with scientific, technological and socio rules.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>If information clusters like web pages or function clusters like services are abstracted as semantic nodes and the relation between clusters as semantic links, the cyber space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving various interactions.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>If the organs are abstracted as service nodes and the relations between organs are abstracted as semantic links, an individual physiological space can be abstracted as a complex semantic link network evolving with physiological rules and the flows of material, energy and information through the links.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>If symbols or symbol units (e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) are abstracted as semantic nodes, and the relations (e.g., sequential relation and cause-effect relation) between symbols are abstracted as semantic links, the symbol space can be regarded as an evolving semantic link network with rules of languages.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>This type of complex link can be regarded as a service that can model the mental space, recognize socio behaviors and events, and organize services according to the semantic image emerging in the mental space and socio rules.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Different from previous notions about the mental space [23][47][51], the mental space model depicted in Fig.7 is based on the multi-dimensional classification space, link and the Interactive Semantic Base ISB [89], since classification, link and interaction are the basis of the development of the mental space.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>The mental space can be modeled by integrating an adaptive multi-dimensional classification space (e.g., the Resource Space Model) and a self-organized Semantic Link Network [81][87], which can evolve with co-experience in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Human minds reflect one another and reflect the patterns in the physical space and socio space and evolve themselves patterns, make artifacts such as mirrors and lens to reflect more of themselves and the other spaces, and create the cyber space to reflect the society.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>A simple semantic space suggested for regulating the semantics of a Semantic Link Network (SLN) consists of a classification hierarchy of concepts and a set of linking rules [81][87].</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>All possible semantic images constitute a semantic space, which can be modeled by integrating multi-dimensional classifications, the semantic links between points and between coordinates, the rules of linking and constraints, and relevant operations [89].</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>Reasoning on semantic links is different from traditional reasoning on the production rules in knowledge-based systems due to the diversity of semantic links and rules.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>An SLN may be changed after deleting a previously added semantic link because adding a semantic link may derive new semantic links, which may further derive other semantic links.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>The complex link can not only play the role of a semantic link but also facilitate interaction and transmit resources (denoted as ci) according to the interests of nodes and the rules on both nodes and links in multiple spaces.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>As depicted in Fig.10 (c), the cyber space can visualize the semantic link networks for humans to operate according to the semantic images in mind.</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>This concerns clustering semantic nodes according to their attributes, and determining the semantic links between clusters.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Various sensors and mobile devices link the cyber space to the physical space and the socio space so that the real-time status in the places and buildings as well as individuals, communities and events can be assessed.</a>
