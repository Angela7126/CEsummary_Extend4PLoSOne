<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>If it is not there, the processor has to go to the L3 cache (typically main memory of a few Gigabytes).</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>If the data is not there, the processor has to go to the level 2 cache (a few megabytes) that are typically 10 clocks away.</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>If the data is there, great, that just costs 2 clocks.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>If the data is not there, it must be on disk.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>A single disk can deliver about 30 MBps of data if the disk is read sequentially.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>You have to go sequentially through the data so that the system can prefetch it and pipeline it to the processor.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Therefore is increasingly important that large computations lay the data out on disk in a sequential order, and scan it sequentially if possible.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>If you have to go to main memory, it is an hour's drive there and back.</a>
