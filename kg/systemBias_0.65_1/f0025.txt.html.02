<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>As requested by Johan van Benthem, this is a brief introduction to the logical formalism for context being explored by John McCarthy and Sasa Buvac at Stanford University.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>in both cases, I think you want it to achieve 'efficiency' and 'portability' of information, (2) what is involved in the dynamics of changing contexts, perhaps with attendant changes in linguistic formulation (add or drop variables, etcetera).</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>5) Buvac and McCarthy have also discussed using context to combine aspects of plans generated by different planners not originally designed to work together|or plans originally intended to work together but which have drifted apart in the course of separate development.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>However, the applications to natural language, to databases and to formalizing common sense knowledge and reasoning require a lot more.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>This presents problems beyond those presented by propositions, because in general the space of values of individual concepts will depend on some outer context.</a>
